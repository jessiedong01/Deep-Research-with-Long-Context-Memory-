  "writeup": "# The Federal Government Should Substantially Increase Social Services for Persons in Poverty\n\n- Recommendation: Yes \u2014 the federal government should substantially increase social services for persons in poverty to reduce child poverty and material hardship and to improve child health and development outcomes.\n  - Rationale: Current programs leave large coverage gaps and impose design\u2011driven exclusions; empirical evidence shows sizable, causal reductions in child poverty and material hardship from expanded income and service supports; fiscal planning requires micro\u2011costing and phased implementation to manage short\u2011term obligations and administrative scaling [1][2][3][5][6].\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis report recommends that the federal government substantially increase social services for persons living in poverty. The recommendation is grounded in program\u2011coverage data showing large unmet needs, causal evidence that income and service expansions markedly reduce child poverty and material hardship (including large drops in food/material hardship), and costing/administration analyses that describe how to implement expansions responsibly while managing fiscal and operational risks [1][2][3][5][6].\n\n### Recommendation\n- Clear statement: Yes \u2014 the federal government should substantially increase social services for persons in poverty to reduce child poverty and material hardship and to improve health and child development outcomes [1][2][3][5].\n\n### Key findings supporting the recommendation\n- Large coverage gaps and inadequate benefits:\n  - Child\u2011care subsidies (CCDF) serve roughly 1.8 million children versus ~11.5 million baseline\u2011eligible children (~15% reach), implying about 9.7 million federally\u2011eligible but unserved children [1][2][3].\n  - Other programs are capped or rationed (e.g., CCDF and TANF block grants), producing state variation in access and benefit adequacy [1][2][3].\n- Design\u2011driven exclusions and administrative barriers:\n  - Family tax supports such as the Child Tax Credit (CTC/ACTC) phase in with earnings, so an estimated ~30% of children cannot receive the full credit; tightened SSN/documentation and complex paperwork further exclude some families [1][3].\n  - Recertification churn, state discretion, and fragmented program rules reduce take\u2011up and continuity across cash and care supports [1][2][4].\n- Expected direct benefits:\n  - Expanded income\u2011support and service programs produce substantial reductions in child poverty and material hardship; reviewed studies document large drops in food/material hardship on the order of ~14 percentage points in some settings (e.g., the 2021 CTC expansion) and measurable child health and education gains [1][3][4].\n- Implementation and fiscal considerations:\n  - The reviewed costing literature does not provide a single universal price tag for large expansions; analysts emphasize micro\u2011costing, scenario and sensitivity analysis, and modeling of behavioral interactions to produce reliable budgets [5][6].\n  - Scaling requires upfront investments in staffing, IT/data systems, facility and capital accounting, and phased roll\u2011outs using large\u2011project budgeting practices to manage obligations and limit leakages [5][6][8].\n- Main trade\u2011offs and risks:\n  - Short\u2011term fiscal and capacity costs are substantial; labor\u2011market responses to income transfers are heterogeneous, and program design (refundability, tapering, conditionalities) materially affects both costs and employment incentives [1][2][5].\n\n### Preconditions and conditional checklist for proceeding\n- Policymakers should only proceed with large rollouts after: a transparent funding plan; pilot(s) with micro\u2011costing and scenario testing; committed administrative capacity investments (staffing, IT, verification); phased implementation; and built\u2011in rigorous evaluation metrics to monitor poverty impacts, fiscal offsets, and unintended consequences [5][6][1].\n\n## 1. Background and scope\n\n### 1.1 Research question and policy framing\nThis report addresses whether the United States federal government should substantially increase social services for persons living in poverty. The recommendation is affirmative: expansions are likely to produce large social gains for children and families when implemented with careful fiscal planning and administrative strengthening. The recommendation synthesizes evidence on program coverage, causal impacts on poverty and hardship, costing practice, and implementation constraints [1][2][3][5][6].\n\n### 1.2 Summary of evidence base used\n- Program coverage and administrative descriptions (CCDF, Head Start, CTC, EITC, SNAP, Medicaid/CHIP, TANF) document baseline reach, eligibility rules, and rationing mechanisms [1][2][3][4].\n- Causal and observational studies evaluate impacts of income and service expansions on poverty, material hardship, child health, and educational outcomes (including RCTs and quasi\u2011experimental work) [1][2][3][4].\n- Costing and administrative analyses describe methods (micro\u2011costing, top\u2011down modeling), data gaps (facility/capital inventories), and large\u2011project budgeting practices relevant to scaling programs [5][6][8].\n\n## 2. Current federal social\u2011services landscape and unmet needs\n\nThis section summarizes program features, how they are delivered, and where they fail to reach eligible people\u2014particularly children in low\u2011income families.\n\n### 2.1 Overview of programmatic reach and rationing\n- Several federal programs operate as entitlements (e.g., SNAP, Medicaid/CHIP) while others are capped block grants or administered with state discretion (e.g., CCDF, TANF), producing rationing and waitlists where funding is constrained [1][2][3].\n- Fragmentation across programs (cash tax credits vs. care supports) and state variation create coordination gaps, cliffs, and missed complementarities that blunt potential employment and child\u2011outcome gains [1][2].\n\n### 2.2 Concrete coverage example: Child\u2011care subsidies (CCDF)\n- CCDF description and funding: CCDF subsidizes care for children under 13 to support parental work or training, administered by states/tribes under federal baselines (e.g., guidance around \u226485% State Median Income) and with health/safety standards; federal CCDF funding is a capped block grant (roughly $9.5B FY2021 plus pandemic supplements) [1][2][3].\n- Reach and implied gap: About 1.8 million children received CCDF subsidies in an average month in FY2021, compared with roughly 11.5 million children who meet federal eligibility baselines \u2014 a reach of \u224815% and an implied gap of \u22489.7 million unserved children [1][2][3].\n- Causes of under\u2011reach: State rationing, waitlists, paperwork, and provider capacity constraints (payment rates and supply) limit effective access even for federally\u2011eligible families [1][2][4].\n\n### 2.3 Family tax supports and access gaps\n- Child Tax Credit (CTC) features: The CTC delivers cash via the tax system and includes a refundable component (ACTC) that phases in with earnings (e.g., 15% above a threshold) and is subject to refund caps; recent statutory changes made higher indexed maxima permanent but tightened SSN/documentation requirements [1][3].\n- Coverage shortfall: Because the ACTC phases in with earnings, analysts estimate roughly 30% of children live in families that cannot receive the full CTC due to insufficient parental earned income; tightened SSN/documentation requirements further exclude some families (noncitizens, under\u2011documented households) [1][3].\n- Other refundable supports: EITC and premium tax credits provide important refundable assistance but similarly depend on earnings and tax\u2011filing interactions, which limit reach for families disconnected from stable employment or facing filing barriers [1][2].\n\n### 2.4 Administrative barriers that reduce take\u2011up\n- Nonfinancial barriers: Complex paperwork, recertification churn, strict documentation/SSN requirements, and state\u2011level procedural variation substantially reduce participation across CCDF, Head Start, CTC/EITC, Medicaid/CHIP, and other programs [1][2][4].\n- Data gaps: Limited disaggregation by subgroup and sparse overlap data across programs impede targeted outreach and evaluation, constraining efforts to close coverage shortfalls [4].\n\n## 3. Evidence on likely effects of expanding social services\n\nThis section synthesizes causal and observational evidence on poverty, material hardship, child development, and labor\u2011market responses.\n\n### 3.1 Poverty and material\u2011hardship outcomes\n- Causal reductions in poverty and hardship:\n  - Expansions of income\u2011support programs (refundable tax credits, cash transfers, SNAP, housing assistance) produce sizable declines in child poverty and material hardship [1][2][3].\n  - Example magnitude: Evaluations of the 2021 Child Tax Credit expansion and similar interventions report large reductions in food/material hardship \u2014 on the order of ~14 percentage points among recipient families in reviewed studies [1][3][4].\n- Persistence and heterogeneity:\n  - Impacts are generally larger for the most economically vulnerable households and can persist when children are exposed early, though heterogeneity across subgroups and regions requires further study [3][4].\n\n### 3.2 Child health and development outcomes\n- Health:\n  - Medicaid/CHIP expansions and improved coverage increase preventive care and reduce avoidable hospitalizations for children; short\u2011term reductions in medical hardship follow increased benefit receipt [2][3].\n- Education and development:\n  - Income increases from prior policy eras were associated with higher family income and modest but meaningful gains in young children\u2019s test scores (examples include movements from roughly the 25th to the 30th percentile in some studies) and longer\u2011run reductions in hardship up to a decade later in some evaluations [1][3].\n- Overall confidence:\n  - Evidence strength is medium for health and education outcomes, drawing on RCTs, quasi\u2011experimental designs, and longitudinal follow\u2011up studies [1][2][3].\n\n### 3.3 Labor\u2011market and behavioral responses\n- Heterogeneous labor\u2011supply effects:\n  - Studies indicate that income itself is a key pathway for child outcome improvements; increases in parental employment are not the sole mechanism and employment responses vary by program design and population [1][2].\n- Design sensitivity:\n  - Program rules (refundability, taper rates, conditionalities) affect work incentives and therefore both fiscal costs and employment outcomes; careful modeling of these behavioral responses is essential when estimating net costs and effects [1][2][5].\n\n## 4. Fiscal costs, costing practices, and funding considerations\n\nThis section outlines what the costing literature can and cannot tell policymakers and recommends fiscal practices before scaling.\n\n### 4.1 Limits of existing costing evidence\n- No single universal price tag:\n  - Reviewed costing analyses do not supply a single, generalizable dollar total for large\u2011scale expansions; instead, they describe methods and disaggregations needed to derive reliable estimates (micro\u2011costing vs top\u2011down approaches) [5][6].\n- Data limitations:\n  - Facility/capital inventories and detailed provider\u2011side inputs are often missing, reducing precision and increasing uncertainty in long\u2011run budget estimates [5][6].\n\n### 4.2 Key drivers of fiscal variation\n- Behavioral interactions:\n  - Fiscal outcomes depend on labor\u2011market responses, utilization changes, price effects, and interactions with existing programs (e.g., how CTC expansions alter need for subsidized child care) [5][6].\n- Design choices:\n  - Refundability, phase\u2011in formulas, taper rates, and eligibility rules materially affect cost estimates and distributional outcomes [1][5].\n\n### 4.3 Recommended fiscal approach prior to large rollouts\n- Micro\u2011costing and scenario analysis:\n  - Use activity\u2011based micro\u2011costing where granular inputs exist; complement with top\u2011down modeling and extensive sensitivity analyses to bound uncertainty [5][6].\n- Model offsets and dynamic effects:\n  - Incorporate expected fiscal offsets (e.g., lower downstream health spending, changed tax receipts) and behavioral responses in dynamic models rather than relying solely on static estimates [5][6].\n- Large\u2011project budgeting practices:\n  - Apply staged obligation and clear cash\u2011flow management practices, drawing on precedents for large federal projects to manage upfront obligations and timing [8].\n\n## 5. Administrative capacity and implementation timing\n\nExpansions will succeed only if administrative systems and staffing scale appropriately. This section details required investments and implementation sequencing.\n\n### 5.1 Upfront investments and scaling needs\n- Staffing and operational resources:\n  - Scaling programs requires measurable increases in personnel FTEs, training, and provider supports to manage caseloads and quality standards [5][6].\n- IT, data, and facility capital:\n  - Enhanced IT/data systems, time\u2011series cost tracking, and facility/capital inventories are essential to detect economies/diseconomies of scale and to budget capital obligations accurately [5][6].\n- Funding for provider capacity:\n  - Increasing subsidy payment rates and workforce investments helps expand provider supply and improve quality, reducing the supply constraints that currently limit access [1][2].\n\n### 5.2 Project management and phased roll\u2011outs\n- Phased implementation:\n  - Phase\u2011in expansions to allow administrative scaling, piloting, correction, and learning; use run\u2011in pilots with micro\u2011costing to inform full budgets [5][6].\n- Large\u2011project management:\n  - Employ large\u2011project budgeting and obligation practices (staged obligations, transparent cash\u2011flow planning) to manage short\u2011term fiscal pressures and reduce the risk of implementation failure [8][5].\n\n### 5.3 Measures to reduce churn and leakage\n- Administrative simplification:\n  - Simplify eligibility verification and reduce recertification burdens to lower churn and increase continuous coverage [1][5].\n- Cross\u2011program coordination:\n  - Align outreach and enrollment across tax systems, CCDF, Head Start, and health programs; build auto\u2011enrollment/referral pathways to reduce paperwork barriers and increase take\u2011up [1][2].\n- Verification and monitoring:\n  - Strengthen verification systems and monitoring to detect fraud and leakage; build in evaluation to measure and reduce administrative error over time [5][6].\n\n## 6. Trade\u2011offs, risks, and unintended consequences\n\nThis section describes the principal trade\u2011offs and how design can mitigate risks.\n\n### 6.1 Short\u2011term fiscal and capacity trade\u2011offs\n- Upfront fiscal outlays:\n  - Large expansions require substantial near\u2011term appropriations or reallocated revenue; careful budgeting and transparent funding plans are necessary to maintain fiscal credibility [5][6].\n- Administrative capacity constraints:\n  - Without mandated investments in staffing and IT, expansions risk poor implementation, higher error rates, and undermined outcomes [5][6].\n\n### 6.2 Interaction effects and programmatic risks\n- Program overlap and cliffs:\n  - Poorly coordinated expansions can create benefit cliffs, redundant spending, or gaps where programs do not align; modeling interactions across programs is essential to estimate net incremental costs and effects [5][1].\n- Data and targeting limitations:\n  - Limited overlap data (who receives CTC vs CCDF vs Head Start) impedes efficient targeting; investing in integrated administrative data reduces this risk [4][1].\n\n### 6.3 Labor\u2011supply risks and design implications\n- Heterogeneous responses:\n  - Labor\u2011market responses to cash transfers vary; some designs dampen work incentives more than others. Empirical work shows income often explains child benefits more than employment increases, but designers must model labor effects to estimate net fiscal impacts [1][2].\n- Design levers:\n  - Choices on refundability, taper rates, and conditionalities can be tuned to balance poverty reduction with employment incentives and fiscal costs [1][5].\n\n## 7. Design recommendations to maximize reach and impact\n\nConcrete design choices can substantially increase reach and the likelihood of net social gains.\n\n### 7.1 Targeting reach and adequacy\n- Make family tax supports reachable for the poorest:\n  - Options include fuller refundability of the CTC or creating a non\u2011earnings supplement so children in very low\u2011 or no\u2011earnings households receive full benefits [1][3].\n- Expand child\u2011care subsidies toward entitlement\u2011like access:\n  - Substantially increase CCDF funding or change entitlement rules to close the estimated ~9.7 million CCDF gap; pair subsidy increases with provider payment rate boosts and workforce investments to expand affordable supply [1][2].\n\n### 7.2 Phasing, funding, and administrative strengthening\n- Phased roll\u2011out with pilots and micro\u2011costing:\n  - Require pilot phases with micro\u2011costing and scenario testing before full national rollouts to refine budgets and administrative processes [5][6].\n- Mandatory administrative investments:\n  - Fund staffing, IT, eligibility verification improvements, facility/capital data collection, and cross\u2011program coordination to reduce churn, leakage, and underestimation of long\u2011run obligations [5][6].\n- Evaluation and transparency:\n  - Build rigorous quasi\u2011experimental evaluation (and RCTs where feasible) and transparent reporting into implementation to measure heterogeneous impacts and fiscal offsets [1][5].\n\n## 8. Key uncertainties and data gaps\n\nEven with strong evidence of benefits, important uncertainties remain.\n\n- Long\u2011term heterogeneity:\n  - More evidence is needed on long\u2011run adult outcomes for children exposed to scaled programs, and on variation across race/ethnicity, region, and family structure [3][1].\n- Facility and capital costing:\n  - Limited public data on facility/capital needs and provider inputs increases fiscal uncertainty for service expansions [5][6].\n- Measured leakage and fraud magnitudes:\n  - The literature reviewed provides limited measured evidence on fraud and leakage at scale; improved monitoring data are needed to quantify these risks [5][6].\n- Cross\u2011program overlap data:\n  - Lack of integrated administrative data hampers targeting and accurate estimates of combined shortfalls (e.g., overlap of CTC recipients with CCDF/Head Start use) [4][1].\n\n## 9. Conditional checklist for confident implementation\n\nPolicymakers should satisfy the following before broadly scaling expansions:\n\n- Transparent funding plan and identified offsets:\n  - Publicly specify how expansions will be funded over multi\u2011year horizons and how offsets (behavioral or administrative) will be estimated [5][6].\n- Pilot(s) with micro\u2011costing and scenario testing:\n  - Implement staged pilots with activity\u2011based costing and sensitivity analysis to refine per\u2011participant and system budgets [5][6].\n- Committed investments in administrative capacity:\n  - Fund necessary staffing, IT/data systems, verification processes, facility/capital inventories, and provider payment increases to expand supply [5][6].\n- Built\u2011in rigorous evaluation metrics:\n  - Pre\u2011register evaluation plans, include quasi\u2011experimental or randomized designs where feasible, and track poverty impacts, fiscal offsets, labor responses, and leakage [1][5].\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- Restatement of recommendation:\n  - The federal government should substantially increase social services for persons living in poverty. Empirical evidence indicates such expansions produce important, causal reductions in child poverty and material hardship and yield measurable gains in child health and development when delivered effectively [1][2][3][4].\n- Balance of evidence and conditions:\n  - The likely net social gains are contingent on realistic fiscal planning, micro\u2011costing, phased roll\u2011outs, and substantial administrative investments to avoid underfunding, leakage, and implementation failure [5][6][8].\n- Immediate next steps:\n  - Commission micro\u2011costing studies and pilot roll\u2011outs for prioritized expansions (notably CCDF scale\u2011ups and CTC refundability reforms), commit funding for administrative capacity building, and embed rigorous evaluation to guide scale decisions [5][6][1].\n\n## Appendix: Key quantitative findings documented in the review\n\n- CCDF reach and gap: CCDF served ~1.8 million children vs ~11.5 million baseline\u2011eligible children (\u224815% reach), implying ~9.7 million unserved children [1][2][3].\n- Child Tax Credit access gap: Because the ACTC phases in with earnings, roughly 30% of children live in families that cannot receive the full CTC due to insufficient parental earnings; tightened SSN/documentation rules further restrict access for some families [1][3].\n- Reported material\u2011hardship effects: Evaluations (including the 2021 CTC expansion) report reductions in food/material hardship on the order of ~14 percentage points among recipient families in reviewed studies [1][3][4].\n- Note on costing evidence: Reviewed costing literature does not present a single universal dollar total for large expansions; cost estimates depend on micro\u2011costing inputs, behavioral interactions, program overlaps, and facility/capital data availability [5][6][8].\n\n## References\n\n[1] About Program Income and Public Assistance - U.S. Census Bureau - https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/public-assistance/about.html\n\n[2] What are the major federal safety net programs in the U.S.? - https://poverty.ucdavis.edu/article/war-poverty-and-todays-safety-net-0\n\n[3] Programs that Use the Poverty Guidelines as a Part of Eligibility ... - https://www.hhs.gov/answers/hhs-administrative/what-programs-use-the-poverty-guidelines/index.html\n\n[4] What federal benefits (means-tested benefits) might my family and I ... - https://studentaid.gov/help/means-tested-benefits\n\n[5] Social programs in the United States - Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States\n\n[6] Health Coverage by Race and Ethnicity, 2010-2023 - KFF - https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/health-coverage-by-race-and-ethnicity/\n\n[7] The convergence of racial and income disparities in health ... - https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12939-021-01436-z\n\n[8] Who Goes Without Health Insurance?

        "#  What are the major federal safety net programs in the U.S.? A summary of efforts to reduce poverty in the U.S.\nSome of these programs are entitlements. Everyone can expect to receive an Earned Income Tax Credit if they qualify. Other programs, like the nutrition assistance programs SNAP and WIC, only benefit those who claim them before the budgeted funds run out.\nHere is a timeline and summary of selected safety net programs in the U.S.\n### 1935: The Social Security Act\nPart of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal legislation, the original act included grants to states for unemployment compensation, aid to dependent children and public health. Today, Social Security is the largest safety net program in the U.S. In 2017 it will reach an estimated 62 million Americans with $955 billion in benefits.\nFor more information visit the \nUnemployment insurance was a part of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s 1935 Social Security Act. Today\u2019s U.S. Department of Labor Unemployment Insurance (UI) programs provide benefits to eligible workers who become unemployed through no fault of their own and who meet certain requirements.\nThe program is a unique federal-state partnership, based on Federal law, but administered by individual states. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that UI benefits totaled $32 2016 when the unemployment rate averaged 4.6 percent. \nFor more information about Unemployment Insurance, visit the \nThis pre-school education program was a part of the 1964 Economic Opportunity Act that was designed to reduce disparities among young children. The 1994 Head Start Act Amendments established the Early Head Start program, which expanded the benefits of early childhood development to low income families with children under three years old.",
        "In 2016 the program served up to 900,000 mostly low-income children per year with total federal spending of over $8.7 billion. While the program\u2019s effectiveness has been criticized by prominent researchers, show the benefits of Head Start, especially for children at the bottom of the skill distribution. \nFor more information on Head Start, visit the [Office of Head Start online](http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs/)\n### 1964: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\nThe first Food Stamp program ran from 1939-43, but the program we know today was established with the 1964 Food Stamp Act. The program is now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and served 44.2 million people with $66.5 billion in benefits in 2016.\nStudies co-authored by Research Affiliate Hilary Hoynes found that SNAP contributed to increases in birth weights, but also found that the benefit is associated with fewer hours worked.\nFor more information on the program, visit the [Food and Nutrition Service website for SNAP](http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/snapmain.htm)\nThese health programs were established with amendments to the Social Security Act in 1965. Today, Medicare provides health insurance for people over 65 years of age and some younger than that but who have certain disabilities or diseases. Medicaid is a Federal and state partnership that provides health coverage for people with low income.\nDuring 2015, enrollment in Medicare averaged about 55.3 million people who received $615.6 billion in benefits. In fiscal year 2015, total Medcaid spending was $552.3 billion, of which federal spending for Medicaid was $348 billion ($301 billion covered benefits for enrollees). States funded the additional $220 billion. Approximately 68.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 2015.\nFor more information about Medicare and Medicaid, visit the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services online](http://www.cms.gov/)",
        "For more information on Pell Grants, visiting the [U.S. Department of Education online](http://www2.ed.gov/programs/fpg/index.html)\n### 1975: The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)\nThe EITC is a tax credit that benefits working people who have low to moderate income, especially families. In 2015, the EITC reached 46.2 million tax filers at a total cost of $58.8 billion. Since EITC benefits are not considered income for other Federal benefit programs, they do not jeopardize recipients who qualify for other assistance like SNAP or Medicaid.\nResearch has shown that the impacts of the EITC are wider than raising families out of poverty. A by Center Research Affiliates Hilary Hoynes and Douglas Miller found that it also increased birth weights and reduced low birth-weight births.\nFor more information on the EITC, visit the \n### 1996: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\nTANF issues federal grants to states for programs that provide temporary benefits to families with children when the income does not provide for the family\u2019s basic needs. Programs include job preparation, family planning and other benefits as well as cash assistance.\nThe program replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC), which was established by the 1935 Social Security Act. In 1996 it was replaced by TANF as part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act welfare reform that would change the face of the safety net in the U.S. While AFDC allowed families to receive assistance for as long as they were eligible, TANF imposes a five-year limit on benefits.\nWhile the federal government funds a share of state TANF programs, it leaves it to states to determine the shape those programs take. In 2015, the total Federal cost for TANF was about $16 billion, with an additional $15.3 billion coming from states. That year, the program provided cash assistance to about 3 million people."

        "Prior to the enactment of the ACA in 2010, Hispanic, Black, Asian, AIAN, and NHPI people under age 65 were more likely to be uninsured compared to their White counterparts, with Hispanic and AIAN people at the highest risk of lacking coverage (Figure 1). Their higher uninsured rates reflected more limited access to affordable health coverage options. Although the majority of individuals have at least one in the family across racial and ethnic groups, there are ongoing racial disparities in employment and income that result in some groups having more limited access to coverage offered by an employer or having greater difficulty affording private coverage when it is available. While Medicaid helped fill some of these gaps in private coverage, prior to the ACA, Medicaid eligibility for parents in most states was limited to those with very low incomes (often below 50% of the poverty level), and adults without dependent children\u2014regardless of how poor\u2014were .",
        "While there were minimal changes in overall uninsured rates between 2022 and 2023, Hispanic, Black, AIAN, and NHPI people under the age of 65 years old remained more likely than their White counterparts to be uninsured (Figure 2). AIAN and Hispanic people had the highest uninsured rates at 18.7% and 17.9%, respectively, as of 2023. Uninsured rates for NHPI (12.8%) and Black people (9.7%) also were higher than the rate for their White counterparts (6.5%). These differences in uninsured rates are driven by lower rates of private coverage among these groups. Medicaid coverage helps to narrow these differences but does not fully offset them.\nMedicaid and CHIP coverage help fill gaps in private coverage and reduce coverage disparities for children, but some disparities in children\u2019s coverage remain (Figure 2). Medicaid and CHIP cover larger shares of children than adults, reflecting more expansive eligibility levels for children. This coverage helps fill gaps in private coverage, with over half of Hispanic, Black, AIAN, and NHPI children covered by Medicaid and CHIP. However, there remain some disparities in children\u2019s coverage. For example, AIAN children are about three times as likely as their White counterparts to lack coverage (12.7% vs. 4.0%). Moreover, Hispanic children are more than twice as likely as White children to be uninsured (8.5% vs. 4.0%).",
        "under the age of 65, uninsured rates in states that have not expanded Medicaid are higher than rates in expansion states across most racial and ethnic groups as of 2023 (Figure 3). The differences in coverage rates between Black and Hispanic people compared with White people are larger in non-expansion states compared with expansion states. However, the relative risk of being uninsured for Black, Hispanic, and Asian people compared with White people is similar in expansion and non-expansion states. For example, Hispanic people under the age of 65 years old are roughly 2.6 times as likely as their White counterparts to lack coverage in both expansion and non-expansion states. Uninsured rates for AIAN people are similar in expansion and non-expansion states. Overall, the differences in coverage by expansion status are primarily driven by differences in coverage rates among adults ages 18-64. However, White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, and NHPI children in non-expansion states also are more likely to be uninsured than those in expansion states. For example, 13.5% of Hispanic children in non-expansion states are uninsured compared to 6.1% of Hispanic children in expansion states.\n## Eligibility for Coverage among the Uninsured as of 2023"

        "Our findings were consistent with previous studies. Buchmueller and Levy evaluated the ACA\u2019s impact on racial and ethnic disparities in health insurance coverage and access to care, and found a large number of adults remain uninsured, and the uninsurance rate among blacks and Hispanics was substantially higher than the rate among whites []. Another study assessed the insurance patterns and instability from 2006 to 2016, and found despite the post-ACA instability reduction, over 25% of the U.S. population continued to have insurance gaps over a two-year period; and found disparities continued to exist between income groups, race/ethnicities, and regions []. Compared with the above evidence, our results added further empirical evidence on the combined effect of race and income on health insurance coverage in the US, and the uniqueness of our study was looking at the influence of multiple vulnerability traits together rather than separately as other studies did.\nThese findings have significant policy implications. To expand insurance coverage and eliminate racial disparities as called for by Healthy People 2030, concerted and targeted efforts are needed to both improve economic status and address disparities towards racial/ethnic minorities. To maximize limited resources, policymakers should target insurance coverage for the most vulnerable subpopulations, i.e., those with a convergence of predisposing, enabling, and need attributes of risk. The findings placed quantitative content to the theoretical framework of the vulnerability mode. As shown in this study, these are individuals who have low income and are racial/ethnic minorities. Significant progress at reducing disparities in care and quality across racial and ethnic groups is unlikely to be fulfilled without significantly expanding insurance coverage for this most vulnerable group."

        "#  Who Goes Without Health Insurance? Who Is Most Likely to Be Uninsured?\nThis chapter provides a portrait of the uninsured, to support the Committee's future reports about the consequences of uninsurance. Here, the Committee reviews and summarizes the published literature about what socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic characteristics describe the uninsured both collectively and as members of groups in the general population that are more likely than average to be uninsured. Supporting methodological information and data tables provide the numbers behind the general statements in the text and can be found in Appendixes and . All estimates are for persons uninsured during calendar year 1999 (the most recent available Current Population Survey data), unless otherwise indicated.\nThe large number and variety of Americans who are uninsured underscore the Committee's conclusion that the voluntary, employment-based approach to insurance coverage in the United States functions less like a system and more like a sieve. There are many ways to slip through the holes. People of all ages, levels of education, and in all states may be uninsured, although socioeconomic and geographic factors that affect coverage are highly correlated. One's chances of being uninsured increase if one works in an occupation or in an employment sector where employers are less likely to offer a health benefit, if one is self-employed or works for a small private-sector firm, or if one has too low an income to afford coverage.\nThe final section of this chapter includes estimates of the relative importance of key social, economic, demographic, and geographic characteristics to one's likelihood of being uninsured, based on a new multivariate analysis of published data. Most of the studies that the Committee reviewed are based on two-way (bivariate) analyses of a characteristic and the probability that an individual with that characteristic will be uninsured.",
        "Throughout the chapter, the Committee addresses two questions together:     \nWhat are the characteristics of the uninsured population?     \nWho is most likely to be uninsured?\nThe distribution of socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic differences in the general population under age 65 affects how these characteristics are distributed among the uninsured population because the relative size of specific population groups affects their representation among the uninsured. For example, the uninsured for the urban population is the same as that of the rural population, although four out of five uninsured people live in urban areas, reflecting the predominance of urban populations nationally.\n## HOW SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECT COVERAGE\nFull-time, full-year employment offers families the best chances of acquiring and keeping health insurance, as does an annual income of at least a moderate level (greater than 200 percent of the federal poverty level []). Insured status correlates highly with many aspects of employment, including work status, income level, educational attainment, occupation, and employer characteristics such as firm size and employment sector.\nEight out of every ten uninsured people are members of families with at least one wage earner, and six out of every ten uninsured people are wage earners themselves. Nonetheless, members of families without wage earners are much more likely to be uninsured than members of families with wage earners.",
        "Lower-income parents face income and other eligibility criteria that may prevent them from qualifying for , although their children may be covered. This may result in a family being partially insured. Since welfare reform in 1996, lower-income parents have been losing insurance coverage, with the de cline in public coverage greater than the increase in employment-based coverage. The impact falls disproportionately on lower-income mothers (Guyer and Mann, 1999; Garrett and Holahan, 2000; Klein, 2000; Guyer et al., 2001). Only 33 percent of women who move from public assistance to employment obtain coverage through their employer (Garrett and Holahan, 2000). Among low-income people (less than 100 percent of ), working parents are twice as likely to be uninsured as nonworking parents because nonworking, single parents often have very young children and are more likely to have Medicaid coverage (Guyer and Mann, 1999).\n## OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN COVERAGE\nThe nature and type of labor force participation determine whether individuals and family members obtain employment-based coverage. Foreign-born persons and members of ethnic and racial minority groups are more likely than average to be uninsured, although their smaller numbers in the general population mean that uninsured rates overall are dominated by the rates for U.S.-born citizens and non-Hispanic whites.\nMost uninsured people are U.S. citizens by birth (native-born residents comprise about 90 percent of the general population). The relatively small proportion of the general population comprised of naturalized citizens and noncitizens (immigrants) is significantly more likely than U.S.-born residents to be uninsured, although immigrants' uninsured rates decline with increasing length of residency in the United States."

Taking a close look at the data could illuminate ways to help expand health coverage to people who remain uninsured, from dismantling barriers to eligibility and enrollment to improving the scope and accessibility of outreach and enrollment assistance. The overall uninsured rate reached record lows in 2022, but to achieve further coverage gains and to reach racial equity in health coverage, it is essential to sustain and expand upon successful, more targeted policies.",

While it is true that health coverage rates vary across racial and ethnic groups, limiting analysis to broad racial categories \u2014 as is often the practice \u2014 can conceal the diverse experiences of communities within them. Disaggregating race and ethnicity into smaller groups could improve response rates on race/ethnicity questions, shed further light on health inequities, and uncover community needs.\nReasons that data are often not disaggregated into racial and ethnic subgroups can include sample sizes that are too small for precise estimation, concerns over privacy and surveillance, and the risk that users of the data will misattribute differences between groups and not account for the context of inequities such as racism, discrimination, and other structural barriers to opportunity. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which sets national race and ethnicity reporting standards, cites a lack of consensus in terminology as an additional barrier to adding racial and ethnic categories to the minimum federal reporting requirements."

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites. \nThe Office of Child Care (OCC) administers the Child Care and Development Fund program (CCDF), which is the primary federal funding source to help families with low incomes access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children. Access to affordable high-quality child care has numerous short- and long-term benefits for children, families, and society, supporting child and family well-being in a manner that fuels prosperity and strengthens communities and the economy. Child care is a necessity for most families with young children and reliable access leads to better parental earnings and employment and supports parents' educational attainment.\nCCDF is the primary federal funding source for child care subsidies to help eligible low-income working families access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children.\nThe passage of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of 2014 reauthorized the law governing CCDF. The law defines health and safety requirements for child care providers, outlines family-friendly eligibility policies, expands quality improvement efforts, and ensures that parents and the public have transparent information about the child care choices available to them. Under the law, States continue to have flexibility within federal guidelines over key policy levers\u2014including subsidy payment rates, co-payment amounts contributed by the family, income thresholds for determining eligibility, and quality improvement investments.\n### Child Care Services Funded by CCDF",
        "Subsidized child care services are available to eligible families through certificates (vouchers), or grants and contracts with providers. Under the law, States must establish eligibility policies, including a period of at least 12 months before eligibility is re-determined, that promote continuity of care for children and families. The program provides parents with the choice of a range of provider settings and types\u2014including centers, family child care homes, relatives, and faith-based providers. Parents may select a participating child care provider that satisfies applicable state and local requirements, including health and safety requirements. Under the law, States must: ensure that these health and safety requirements address key areas (such as first aid and CPR); require that providers receive training in these areas; complete comprehensive criminal background checks; and conduct monitoring that includes annual inspections. Approximately 1.3 million children receive a child care subsidy from the CCDF program every month.\nA portion of CCDF funds must be used to improve the quality of child care and other additional services to parents, such as resource and referral counseling regarding the selection of child care providers. The 2014 law increases the minimum amount that States are required to spend for quality activities, and includes new funding for improving the quality of care for infants and toddlers. To improve the health and safety of available child care, CCDF lead agencies provide training, grants and loans to providers; improved monitoring; compensation projects; and other innovative programs. Many lead agencies are making systemic investments, such as developing quality rating and improvement systems and professional development systems. Tribes may use a portion of their funds to construct child care facilities provided there is no reduction in the current level of child care services.",
        "The CCDF allows states to serve families through a single, integrated child care subsidy program under the rules of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. States coordinate CCDF with Head Start, pre-k, and other early childhood programs. States can also transfer a portion of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families dollars to CCDF, or spend TANF directly for child care.\n### State and Tribal Child Care Plans\nAll states, territories and tribes must submit comprehensive plans every three years and conduct public hearings to invite public comment.\nA portion of CCDF is used for child care research, demonstration and evaluation activities. These funds are increasing the capacity for child care research at the national, state and local levels while addressing critical questions with implications for children and families. Funds have been awarded to support individual project areas, including policy research, research partnerships, research scholars and a web-based archive called Child Care and Early Education Research Connections.\nA small portion of the CCDF is used by the Office of Child Care to provide technical assistance to grantees. Its technical assistance network is designed to address the needs of states, territories and tribes administering CCDF.\nCCDF is authorized under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act (CCDBG) which was enacted under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The CCDBG Act was amended and reauthorized by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, and again by the CCDBG Act of 2014. CCDF made $9.5 billion available to states, territories, and tribes in fiscal year 2021. In addition, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriation Act (or CRRSA Act) provided $10 billion in supplemental CCDF monies to address the impacts of the coronavirus."

Publicly Released: Jan 30, 2025. \nThe Child Care and Development Fund gives grants to states to subsidize child care for low-income families so parents can go to work, school, or job training.\nThis is our 5th report on who is eligible for the subsidies and who got them.\nThe number of children getting subsidies declined from 2 million in 2019 and 2020 to 1.8 million in 2021\u2014about 15% of those eligible per federal rules\nHealth and Human Services attributed this to widespread parent job losses that left children ineligible\nMany states are seeking waivers for more time to implement new rules that cap family co-payments at 7% of income, require states to pay in advance, and more\nThe Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the primary source of federal funding to states for subsidies that help low-income families afford child care so parents can work, attend school, or participate in job training. According to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) data, about 1.8 million children received child care subsidies in an average month in fiscal year 2021, roughly 15 percent of the 11.5 million children eligible under federal rules. Subsidies are not an entitlement and states have to prioritize which children receive them due to limited funds.\nChild Care Subsidy Eligibility and Receipt, Fiscal Year 2021\nThe number of children eligible for subsidies declined between 2019 and 2020, which HHS attributes to job loss that left children ineligible for subsidies based on their parents\u2019 work status. Eligibility began to rebound in 2021 but did not return to 2019 levels. The number of children receiving subsidies also declined from 2.0 million in 2019 and 2020 to 1.8 million in 2021."

        "More from Bipartisan Policy Center\n\nThe Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the largest source for child care. CCDF funds are distributed to states, tribes, and territories to help them administer child care assistance programs for low-income working families. As conversations around federal and child care access dominate news cycles, understanding how child care is funded is key.\nCCDF was created in 1996 to help low-income workers child care. The fund is comprised of two financing mechanisms: the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) and Child Care Entitlement to States (CCES). CCDF combines CCDBG discretionary funds and CCES mandatory and matching funds into block grants for states, tribes, and territories to subsidize the cost of child care\u2014streamlining a one stop shop for administering and governing funding. It is housed in the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Child Care.\nCCDF allows states to provide eligible families with a subsidy to help pay for a licensed child care program for their child, so that they can work, attend job training, or enroll in an educational program. States are required to have one department, a \u201cLead Agency,\u201d responsible for creating and managing CCDF funds.\nLead Agencies must follow broad federal guidelines for eligibility but they have a significant amount of autonomy to restrict their own state regulations. CCDF federal guidelines require the child families are seeking assistance for to meet the following requirements:\n  * Be under 13 years of age;\n  * Live with one or more parents who are working or enrolled in a job training or education program;\n  * Live in a family whose income does not exceed 85% of the State Median Income (SMI); and\n  * Live in a family whose assets do not exceed $1 million.",
        "Lead Agencies often shrink eligibility for child care subsidies through stricter requirements on family income and work provisions. Based on the 2025-2027 state plans, submitted to ACF every three years to show compliance with CCDF regulations, 31 states restrict their family income requirement to lower than 85% of SMI. Stricter requirements are often necessary due to high demand for child care assistance and funding constraints.\nCCDF also directs Lead Agencies to implement health and safety regulations, child care workforce development systems, quality improvement activities, and other actions that promote the accessibility of child care for all. HHS last updated CCDF regulations in .\n## Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG)\nThe Child Care and Development Block Grant, perhaps the most well-known aspect of CCDF, is only one part of the federal money allocated through CCDF. CCDBG funds and regulates child care services across all 50 states with discretionary funding passed by Congress through annual appropriations bills.\nCCDBG discretionary funds are administered through CCDF to each state based on the following funding allocation formula:\n  * The number of children under age five living in the state;\n  * The number of children living in the state who qualify for the National School Lunch Program; and\n  * The state per capita income.",
        "The allocation of matching funds per state is determined by the number of children under age 13 living in the state. The Lead Agency must \u201cmatch\u201d those funds with their own funding, this time using their Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate.\nOccasionally, CCDF administers more than just CCDBG and CCES funding. States can transfer up to 30% of their [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BPC_ECI-TANF-FY21-Report_RV22023.pdf) block grant funds directly to CCDF\u2014but not all states do. In FY 2023, states transferred a total of $1 billion from TANF to CCDF, allowing for their child care assistance programs to serve more low-income, working families.\nOriginally created to support low-income working parents, CCDF\u2019s role has grown, becoming an integral program supporting accessibility, stability, and quality within the wider child care landscape. Understanding the fiscal intricacies of CCDF is crucial for creating future policy recommendations and the role the federal government plays in supporting child care access for all families.\nYour source for bipartisan policy updates and insights."

If their tax liability is less than the value of their child tax credit, they may be eligible for a refundable credit calculated using the earned income formula. Under this formula, a family is eligible for a refund equal to 15% of their earnings in excess of $2,500, up to $1,700 per child, the maximum amount of the refundable portion of the credit. The credit phases out for unmarried parents with income over $200,000 and married couples with income over $400,000. The amount of the credit by income for a taxpayer with one qualifying child is illustrated below.",
        "## Child Tax Credit Amount by Income Level\nInternal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 24.  \nThe child tax credit was created in 1997 by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 () to help ease the financial burden that families incur when they have children. Like other tax credits, the child tax credit reduces tax liability dollar-for-dollar of the value of the credit. Initially the child tax credit was a nonrefundable credit for most families. A nonrefundable tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer's income tax liability to zero. In contrast, a refundable tax credit can exceed a taxpayer's income tax liability, providing a cash payment to low- and some moderate-income taxpayers who owe little or no income tax. \nThe child tax credit has undergone significant changes over time. At the end of 2017, Congress expanded the credit through 2025 as part of the TCJA (). The TCJA temporarily doubled the maximum credit amount and more than tripled the income level at which the credit begins to phase out. It also made changes to the refundable portion of the credit, including increasing the refundable credit amount from $1,000 to $1,400 per child (adjusted annually for inflation; $1,700 in 2025) and lowering the refundability threshold from $3,000 to $2,500. Although these changes were scheduled to expire at the end of 2025, the FY2025 reconciliation law () made them permanent. That law also permanently increased the maximum child tax credit from $2,000 per child to $2,200 per child, while indexing it to inflation. \nData from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) indicate that the total dollar amount of the child tax credit has increased significantly since enactment from approximately $23 billion in 1998 to $118 billion in 2022, with the largest increase coming after the TCJA expansions and the one-year expansion of the credit in the American Rescue Plan Act () in 2021, as illustrated below.",
        "## Taxpayers with Children, by Income Level in\n% of All Taxpayers With Children |  % of Taxpayers who Receive the Child Credit |  Child Tax Credit as % of After-Tax Income |  Average Child Credit per Taxpayer  \n---|---|---|---  \nThe child tax credit was created in 1997 by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 () to help ease the financial burden that families incur when they have children. Like other tax credits, the child tax credit reduces tax liability dollar for dollar of the value of the credit. Initially the child tax credit was a nonrefundable credit for most families. A nonrefundable tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer's income tax liability to zero, while a refundable tax credit can exceed a taxpayer's income tax liability, providing a cash payment primarily to low-income taxpayers who owe little or no income tax. \nOver the past 20 years, legislative changes have significantly changed the credit, transforming it from a generally nonrefundable credit available only to the middle and upper-middle class, to a refundable credit that more low-income families are eligible to claim. Most recently, at the end of 2017, Congress expanded the credit as part of , often referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJA. The law significantly expanded eligibility for and the amount of the credit for many higher-income taxpayers, with a more modest expansion for lower-income taxpayers. This change generally offsets the suspension of personal exemptions for those with dependents. made these changes permanent, and also increased the maximum credit from 2025 onward.\nThis report provides an overview of the credit under current law and also provides some summary data on these benefits.

        "The recent , the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) passed by Congress and signed by President Trump in July, extended and expanded provisions of the [2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/tax/) (TCJA) that otherwise would have expired at the end of 2025, and included additional relief and support for American families. to the (CTC) drew interest from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle prior to the final package emerged as one of the primary levers to increase support for . Now that the reconciliation package has become law, it is important to understand how the CTC changed, how it stacks up against previous expansions, and how the new law will impact families.\nThe new law made the base credit permanent and increased it to $2,200 per child effective in 2025 (and adjusted for inflation in years after). It also made permanent the phase-out threshold rate of $200,000 ($400,000 for taxpayers married filing jointly) and the $500 nonrefundable credit for non-child dependents. The bill also continues to adjust the refundable part of the credit for inflation each year (in 2025, the maximum refundable credit is $1,700 per child).\nThe bill adjusted the eligibility requirements to now require valid Social Security numbers (SSNs) for both the qualifying child the taxpayer claiming the child (previously, the law only required an SSN for the child). In the case of a joint return, only one parent needs to have an SSN to be eligible to claim the CTC. highlights the changes to the CTC in OBBB, and the proposed version in the House reconciliation bill compared to prior laws.\n### _Table 1: Enhanced CTC Comparisons to Prior Proposals and Law_\n## Proposed Ways and Means Bill (2025)\n$2,200 per child in 2025 (inflation-adjusted annually, starting 2026) | $2,500 per child (temporary); reverts to $2,000 (inflation-adjusted) after 2028",
        "The changes to the CTC will impact families differently, depending on their income levels and eligibility status. For example, the reconciliation package\u2019s more stringent SSN requirements mentioned above will have an impact on the number of people eligible for the credit moving forward. The Tax Policy Center estimated that 500,000 children who would otherwise be considered eligible to the credit if no parent can produce an SSN to comply with the new requirement.\nThe CTC provisions will only partially aid low-income families, despite the increased credit amount, since the CTC\u2019s income parameters remain unchanged. And as the CTC is not fully refundable and many low-income families owe little to nothing in federal income taxes, some families do not benefit from the increases to the base amount of the credit.\nAn estimated [23.8 million children will benefit](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/house-and-senate-plans-boost-child-tax-credit-could-help-more-low-income-families) from the larger CTC; however, those from households with lower incomes will see a smaller impact. shows the credit schedule in 2025 for a single parent with one child. Under the new law, families with a lower adjusted gross income (AGI) between $0 and $26,000 receive the same credit as they would under TCJA in 2025. At an AGI between $27,000 and $243,000, families benefit more from the $200 boost than they did from the TCJA credit, before it phases out.\n### _Figure 2: CTC Schedule for a Single Parent of One Child Under TCJA and OBBB_"

        "* Read the latest Daily Deductions \n_This post has been corrected: The number of children in families that cannot receive the full CTC because their parents do not earn enough is 19 million, not 30 million._\nThe (CTC)\u2014the largest tax benefit supporting families with children\u2014 has swung through big changes in recent years. Generally, the pattern of expansion has been for the credit to be increased to a fixed level and then stagnate, which leads to rising costs eroding the value of the credit. \nThe 2025 reconciliation act, or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), differed from these recent expansion efforts. It permanently increased the maximum credit amount to $2,200 per child and indexed it for inflation. \nA permanent, bigger CTC is good news for many. OBBBA made the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u2019s (TCJA\u2019s) expansion of the CTC permanent, preventing the CTC from dropping from $2,000 to $1,000 per child ([alongside other related changes to family tax provisions](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tcja-didnt-change-child-benefits-most-families-children-very-much)). And, more than that, the OBBBA increased the maximum credit to $2,200, which will now grow with inflation after 2025 (Figure 1). These changes [help middle- and high-income families](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/children-deserve-more-shutdown-threats-and-continuing-resolutions) offset the taxes they owe.\nThese changes do little for families with low incomes, because the credit's pre-OBBBA phase-in rules remain in place. And, as under prior law, that amount grows each year with inflation. But the amount of credit a family can receive beyond taxes owed is limited to 15 percent of earnings above $2,500. A larger credit with these same phase-in rules means that more children now live in families that cannot receive the full CTC because their parents do not earn enough. TPC estimates that number jumped from about to under the new law,about 30 percent of all children.",
        "And there\u2019s more bad news. Average benefits will decline slightly under the new law for the lowest-income families with children\u2014largely because about additional children with Social Security numbers (SSNs) who cannot be claimed by will now be ineligible (Figure 2). Rather than qualifying for the CTC, they can get\u2014at most\u2014a $500 credit that can only be used to offset taxes owed. Average benefits for middle-income and higher-income families with children will increase by about $200.\nA basic principle of the CTC is that all else equal, larger families receive larger benefits. This is true for most higher-income families, but not low-income families. Because of the credit\u2019s , 1.1 million children in low-income families with multiple children will get the same credit as if their families had only 1 child under age 17. This could be changed by phasing the credit in faster for larger families who have modest earnings.\nIn all, the changes to the CTC were a mixed bag for families with children. A larger, permanent, inflation-indexed credit helps many families plan with greater certainty. But, despite research suggesting that investments in children with low incomes more than many other social policies, millions of children in low-income families remain excluded, along with the economic returns that come from investing in them.\nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)\nChild tax credit (CTC)/Child and dependent care tax credit (CDCTC)\nSubscribe to our newsletters today."

        "The Tax Policy Center estimates that slightly less than 90 percent of families with children received an average CTC of $2,520 in 2025. The average credit exceeds the maximum per child credit because families can have more than one child. Families with children in all income groups benefited from the CTC, but families in the lowest income quintile were least likely to benefit because fewer of them have sufficient earnings to qualify for the credit. Just under three-quarters of families in the lowest income quintile were eligible for a CTC, receiving an average credit of $1,610. The average credit was the smallest for this quintile because low-income families are most likely to be limited to the refundable portion of the credit, which was capped at $1,700 in 2025 rather than the full $2,200 limit for the nonrefundable credit (figure 2).\nThe percentage of families with children receiving the credit and the average credit received were the highest among moderate- and middle-income families. The share of families with children claiming a CTC was 93 percent in the second income quintile, 98 percent in third quintile, and 99 percent in the fourth quintile. The proportion of families with children receiving a credit then drops to 78 percent in the highest income quintile because the credit phases out at high incomes (figure 3).\nThe CTC improves the well-being of low-income families with children. The Census Bureau estimates that along with the EITC, the refundable portion of the CTC\u2014the ACTC\u2014lifted 6.4 million people out of poverty in 2023, including 2 million children. Researchers at Columbia estimated that in 2023, the CTC reduced child poverty by 17.1 percent (from a child poverty rate of 16.5 percent without any CTC to 13.7 percent).\n#### Recent History of the CTC",
        "For low-income families, the refundable portion of the credit has also expanded over this time period. Before 2001, the CTC was generally nonrefundable. EGTRRA made part of the credit refundable based on earnings beginning in 2001 with the refundable portion (i.e., the ACTC) available to low-income families with earnings over $10,000 (this amount was indexed for inflation). As a result of changes made in response to the Great Recession, this threshold was temporarily reduced to $8,500 for 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) further reduced this threshold to $3,000 for 2009 and 2010. Along with the Bush-era tax cut changes discussed above, the $3,000 threshold was also extended temporarily after 2010 and ultimately made permanent by Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act.\nThe refundable portion of the CTC under EGTRRA was originally designed in 2001 to coordinate with the earned income tax credit (EITC). Once earnings reached $10,020 for families with two children in 2001, there was no further increase in the EITC. The earnings threshold for the refundable CTC was set at $10,000 so families could now receive a subsidy for earnings in excess of that amount. Like the earning threshold amounts for the EITC, the $10,000 earnings threshold was indexed for inflation. When the earnings threshold for the refundable CTC was reduced\u2014first to $8,500 in 2008 and then to $3,000 beginning in 2009\u2014that link between the phase-in of the refundable CTC and the EITC was broken.\nBoddupalli, Aravind and Luisa Godinez-Puig. 2025. \u201c[\u2019One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019 Child Tax Credit](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/one-big-beautiful-bill-child-tax-credit-would-exclude-millions-american-children)[Would Exclude Millions of American Children.](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/one-big-beautiful-bill-child-tax-credit-would-exclude-millions-american-children)\u201d Washington, DC: Urban-Brookings Tax PolicyCenter.",

        "Further, the Mothers Pensions of the early 1900s showed positive long-term effects on children even though it is unlikely that the program greatly increased children\u2019s participation in child care centers because it predated the widespread adoption of center-based child care.\nWelfare time limits and other stringent welfare rules \u2014 which, in the absence of adequate child care or other services, often function more as a cut in assistance than as a path to stable employment \u2014 have been found to have harmful effects in other studies as well. One Delaware study found that the child protective services agency was more likely to become involved with families that had been randomly assigned to a program of lower welfare benefits, time limits, strict work requirements backed by financial penalties, and other limitations, relative to families receiving a modestly more generous traditional welfare program in the 1990s. The study was unable to determine whether these negative impacts on children were due to lower income, increased parental stress, or other factors associated with the stricter rules. The findings are consistent, however, with the previously mentioned study finding that child maltreatment and child protective services involvement fell after state and federal EITC expansions boosted family incomes. \n## More Research Is Needed, But Available Evidence Is Compelling \nThe bulk of evidence supports the conclusion that economic security programs play a strong role in helping low-income children, although there are exceptions. In science, including the social and behavioral sciences, individual studies are rarely conclusive by themselves; what matters is where the bulk of evidence lies. On balance, the evidence is strongly on the side of the importance of income assistance for low-income children.",

When programs provided more generous income assistance, the comparisons consistently showed better academic performance among young children transitioning into school. And the more the programs increased participating families\u2019 incomes, the more their children\u2019s academic achievement rose, relative to peers assigned to a traditional, less generous welfare program. (See Figure 2.) The five most generous programs raised average income by $1,700 a year.

        "There is still very limited evidence of direct causal links between poverty and children\u2019s development. However, , the [Baby\u2019s First Years project, is assessing the effects of providing direct monthly, unconditional cash payments (of $333) to parents of infants and toddlers experiencing poverty; this work has found that payments led to modest increases in brain activity levels associated with learning and development. Evidence is also provided by quasi-experimental research that investigated](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2115649119) relationships between [policies and interventions that increase income](https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/publication/2022/child-allowance/benefit-cost-analysis) and improvements in child outcomes. For example, evidence is provided by research on welfare reform: An conducted using data from four experimental studies of welfare reform found that increased income was associated with improved academic outcomes, although only for young children (under age 6). Studies of programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Medicaid also supply [causal evidence of the effects of poverty and income on outcomes and the positive impacts of mitigating poverty](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25246/a-roadmap-to-reducing-child-poverty).\nSimilarly, syntheses of studies examining the [effects of welfare reform initiatives](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1602768) on children\u2019s outcomes have found that programs that increased family income were associated with improvements in children\u2019s outcomes; by contrast, programs that increased employment without increasing income were not found to enhance outcomes. These findings suggest the value of social policies and programs that can reduce poverty and those that can reduce the effects of poverty.\n## Policies and Programs Can Reduce or Mitigate Child Poverty",
        "As noted, children living in or near poverty tend to have poorer health, lower academic attainment, and a greater chance of being poor in adulthood, relative to their higher-income peers. Rigorously conducted research\u2014both experimental and non-experimental\u2014suggest that [poverty itself is at the root of these differences](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25246/a-roadmap-to-reducing-child-poverty) because it affects most aspects of children\u2019s lives, ranging from food to housing to family interactions to school quality and neighborhood stress. However, there is a strong and growing research base that supports the efficacy of a wide range of programs and policies for reducing child poverty, mitigating its effects on development, and promoting long-term economic mobility. Such policies can include not just government safety net programs, but also , , and ; however, the research on the impact of these latter policies on child poverty rates is much more limited or findings are mixed (as in the case of ).\nMuch of the existing research on policy and program effectiveness has focused on the role of government programs in improving child and family economic well-being. Programs range from cash transfers and refundable tax credits, intended to directly supplement a family\u2019s income, to in-kind transfers, which typically provide direct services or vouchers that families can use to meet specific needs (such as nutrition, housing, health care, or child care needs). Both types of programs not only provide stability in a family\u2019s access to basic needs during economic downturns and unexpected hardships, but also support longer-term economic mobility by freeing up family resources that can be used to support parents\u2019 labor market participation and improve their access to higher-wage jobs. Such programs also include child care, transportation, and educational and skills investments.",
        "While the research evidence for the benefits of programs such as EITC and SNAP is robust, there is also a growing evidence base for a broader range of programs and services. Studies on the impact of Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program have found that these programs are linked to [increases in preventative care and reductions in preventable hospitalizations among children](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272704000076?casa_token=9gQfUIJ1aMAAAAAA:F5mF9DJa9QMUyUBwjWmp9aLR3BvdZA7sp9AKOBcNMH8kP9tKOkz6g-nQFD9D7zG5FMh4jjJLch4). Children who received Medicaid coverage in early childhood were more likely to have higher , higher , and improved as adults. Evidence on the effects of housing assistance is more mixed, but some evidence suggests that children who were young when their families received housing assistance (allowing them to move to low-poverty neighborhoods) had improved [educational attainment and adult earnings](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21156/w21156.pdf). Early education supports for families with low incomes, such as Head Start, can also promote family economic mobility by supporting increased parent and access to . At the same time, intergenerational economic mobility is supported by improved and among children served by these programs."

        "Income assistance programmes have received noticeable focus from researchers (e.g., ) and policymakers (e.g., ) as viable initiatives to address material hardship at a policy-level. These programmes are typically provided by governmental organisations to help cover basic household expenses such as food, clothing, and housing (). The nature and extent of income support schemes varies widely across different countries and according to individual circumstances, but examples of these programmes include tax credits, one-off cash transfers, unemployment benefits, and pensions. Although material hardship does not necessarily coincide with income poverty (; ), robust evidence indicates that when families receive direct cash transfers, this income \u2018boost\u2019 can help mitigate hardship (; ; ; ). For example, a study by showed expansions to an income assistance programme decreased the likelihood of hardship. In their study, difference-in-differences estimates were used to examine the effects of the 2021 expansion to the Child Tax Credit (CTC) for families in the US. Their results suggested that receiving the CTC led to a significant 14-percentage point decrease in the likelihood of facing food hardship compared with the pre-treatment hardship rate. These findings align with the conceptual framework proposed by for programmes and policies addressing child poverty. This framework explains income support programmes which directly augment family income can be pivotal strategies for poverty reduction by assisting families to acquire basic necessities. We draw on this conceptual framework in this study to highlight initiatives aimed at creating economic opportunities for families as mechanisms through which sustainable solutions to material hardship can be realised. Accordingly, the present study focuses on benefit receipt in the form of means-tested benefits that provide direct cash transfers to families",
        "The long-term findings from this study contribute to the existing literature in several ways. Firstly, these results align with the conceptual framework proposed by , suggesting income assistance can help mitigate material hardship for families by augementing income. Furthermore, these findings add to the body of evidence finding income assistance programmes mitigate hardship (; ; ; ). Previous work found short-term effects of benefits in reducing medical hardship (; ). Our results extend on these findings in that a composite measure of material hardship was assessed. Therefore, our results show that benefit receipt may also be effective in mitigating material hardship as a broader construct. Secondly, previous research has highlighted the lasting effects of benefit programmes for maternal economic factors such as maternal debt reduction () and improvements for maternal wages (). The results from the current study extend on these findings by demonstrating another area where there are likely long-lasting intra-generational effects of benefits\u2014for material hardship. By explaining the temporal trend wherein early benefit recipients exhibited a decreasing likelihood of hardship nearly 12 years later, this study highlights the potential lasting effects of benefits in mitigating hardship for families with children."

Such an approach might include expansion of federal programs like SNAP and housing programs, where expanded access has been associated with a reduction in hardship [\u2013], grant programs for local governments who have shown effectiveness with programs like Housing First [], and/or incentives for nonprofit organizations that alleviate hardship through measures like meal services and utility bill assistance [,].\nBecause material hardship is often chronic, policymakers should focus on solutions that are preventative rather than just remedial. Some examples include weatherizing homes, expanding access to solar energy [], low-cost medical screenings, low-income tax credits, basic income programs [], and reduced or free school lunch programs []. Such approaches would reduce the incidence of material hardship but also likely mitigate the secondary effect of cost and strain on the medical system."

        "Cost estimation models are tools that can assist policy makers and stakeholders to explore the costs and distributional effects of potential policy changes. In this report, the policies examined are those intended to improve access to high-quality early care and education (ECE) opportunities. Cost estimation models address two types of costs: the costs to providers of offering early care and education and the subsidy costs to public and private entities supporting early care and education. Both types of cost are relevant to understanding the impact of policy options.\nDifferent approaches may be appropriate for various categories of audience or user, such as professional policy or budget analysts as opposed to stakeholders, program developers, or administrators. In some cases, it is necessary to have a \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d model that considers all age groups (e.g., infants, toddlers, prekindergartners) and all types of early care and education (center based, prekindergarten, or home based). In other cases, a pressing policy issue may be best addressed by a model specifically designed for a single age group or ECE type (such as promoting access of all 4-year-olds to prekindergarten). An important constraint on cost estimation modeling is the availability of reliable and generalizable data on the costs of certain elements. For example, although facilities are necessary, few data are available on the status of physical facilities and the costs required to rehabilitate or replace them.\nThis appendix first discusses the key attributes of cost estimation models and considerations for desirable outputs of models. It then briefly describes some of the currently available cost estimation models.\n## ATTRIBUTES OF COST ESTIMATION MODELS",
        "Cost estimation models vary in their scope and attributes. For example, models may be limited in their geographic area or the range of services included in the estimate; they may also differ in presenting dynamic or static estimates. A static model is likely to underestimate costs as families shift their patterns of utilization when the policies being modeled enhance quality and financial accessibility of ECE options. In other words, families may use more hours and more expensive types of ECE in response to those policies. A dynamic model can reflect the changes in utilization likely to result from the specified quality improvements or changes in prices, facilities, and locations and factor these changes into the estimated costs.\nThe target geographic areas specified are an important and variable feature of estimation models. Some models refer to a large area, such as a nation or a state; others specify local jurisdictions, such as a city, county, or school district. The focus may even be further narrowed to individual program sites. Consideration of larger areas allows more averaging of data and findings, while assessing smaller areas or individual programs may require more detailed data and analysis. It may also be useful to nest smaller areas within larger ones, such as showing costs for a state, along with costs for each county or school district within the state.\nThe range of services included is another distinction among models. Some programs or policies require inclusion of ancillary or comprehensive services such as physical health and developmental screening, family supports, and referral to housing or employment services. These services can be covered either by augmenting the staffing specified for ECE programs or treating them as a system-level cost in the ECE estimates.",
        "Different agencies within and across federal, state, and local jurisdictions use various budgeting categories. In general, models that derive costs from detailed components and allow aggregation into an array of user-specified categories are most useful. Such models allow the greatest flexibility for components to be added in variable ways to match diverse budget structures and to provide outputs categorized by desired components.\nThis wide range of output requirements on cost estimates may overwhelm the user of the model with details. One approach is to \u201cunfold\u201d different levels of detail, depending upon the needs of the user. Thus, one tab in a worksheet may display total dollar costs and personnel requirements. A second tab might break these totals into components such as child-age groups, ECE types, and personnel versus nonpersonnel costs. A third tab might show detailed costs by staff category, salaries versus benefits, and different types of nonpersonnel costs.\nThis section briefly describes the following examples of currently available cost estimator models:\n  * Human Services Policy Center Cost Simulation\n  * Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) Cost and Staffing Calculator\n  * Provider Cost of Quality Calculator (PCQC)\n  * Center for Benefit-Cost Studies in Education (CBCSE) Cost Tool Kit\n  * Center on Enhancing Early Learning Outcomes (CEELO) Cost of Preschool Quality (CPQ) Tool\n  * Quality Rating & Improvement System (QRIS) Cost Estimation Model\n  * The Standardized Early Childhood Development Costing Tool (SECT)\n  * Professional Development System Cost Analysis Tool"

        "AHRQ Estimating Costs grantees identified key cost elements based on the literature and interviews with primary care clinic leaders to develop a variety of tools, including user-friendly spreadsheets, questionnaires, and online forms, with detailed instructions on how to collect cost data. Some of these tools are quite detailed, while others focus only on key cost drivers (e.g., staff time for various activities). Examples of these tools are provided in .\nIn one example, Miller and colleagues integrated sensitivity analyses into their Web-based tool, allowing clinic leaders to estimate their costs under different scenarios, such as changing staff mix and adding or removing transformation activities. This tool can be used to estimate costs of transformation efforts either prospectively or retrospectively. Additional information about this tool is provided in .\nGrantees used qualitative and mixed methods to describe study settings and methods to estimate costs. The ABC method was used to calculate costs from the clinic\u2019s perspective, while gross-costing methods were used to estimate costs from the perspectives of the insurer, staff model HMO, and grant program that funded primary care transformation efforts.\n#### Analysis Methods to Describe Study Settings and Transformations Implemented\nMost AHRQ Estimating Costs grantees used a case study method to describe key setting characteristics and practice changes. To develop narratives describing the transformation efforts, grantees used rich qualitative data collected through interviews and observations, as well as quantitative data about clinic size, populations served, and other practice characteristics.",
        "Shi and colleagues used a global costing method including both trend analysis and regression modeling to estimate the costs incurred by a grant program to fund primary care transformation efforts across 110 clinics within 24 health care organizations in a large metropolitan area. Grant program expenditure data were used to estimate costs for each participating health care organization and clinic, including personnel, fringe benefits, travel, equipment, supplies, and alterations and renovations. Grant expenditure data were collected at 6-month intervals over a 3-year period. The trend analysis tracked total cost, cost per FTE physician, and cost per visit over the study period. The findings showed the incremental cost for clinics that achieved NCQA PCMH recognition versus clinics that did not. The incremental cost methodology is also discussed in Zuckerman et al.\nShi and colleagues then used a Mann-Whitney test to determine if clinics that achieved PCMH recognition were significantly different from clinics that did not. Propensity score matching was used to identify and retain for linear regression analysis pairs of clinics that were comparable at baseline and differed primarily in whether they attained PCMH recognition during the study period. Linear regression models were used to control for factors other than PCMH transformation that may have affected cost, such as total number of visits, number of FTE physicians, patient demographics (e.g., sex, race, and age), and percentage of uninsured patients. Based on the results of a Hausman test, a fixed effects model was selected to control for unobserved clinic characteristics not varying over time that may have biased results. A difference-in-difference method was used to estimate the difference in cost changes before and after PCMH transformation, comparing clinics that did and did not ultimately achieve PCMH recognition.",
        "A micro-costing (or ABC) approach creates a cost estimate based on a detailed analysis of resources used and the unit costs of each resource. This approach is appropriate to assess the costs of PCMH transformation efforts for most clinics. The benefits of the ABC approach are that it can be used either prospectively or retrospectively, does not require access to aggregate data, can account for all clinic-level resources spent as well as opportunity costs, and is computationally simple (i.e., it does not require statistical analysis software or skills). However, this method is time consuming for both investigators and clinic staff. This method is also susceptible to recall bias (for retrospective studies).\nReport standardized results when possible. To help readers interpret and use the results from cost estimate studies, it is helpful to report results in standardized dollars (e.g., 2012 dollars) and provide metrics that adjust for clinic size (e.g., cost per member or per patient per month, per clinician FTE, or per visit).\n#### Research Gaps and Future Directions\nThe Estimating Costs research team\u2019s experiences highlight some research gaps and suggest promising directions for future research. The suggestions below build on input provided by AHRQ Estimating Costs grantees.\nThe use of a variety of methods and metrics to report the costs of primary care transformation efforts makes meta-analysis difficult. It may therefore be important for the field to develop a consensus on standardized measurement strategies to measure costs on a larger scale. A useful industry model is the Medical Group Management Association\u2019s use of annual cost benchmarking surveys of primary care practices."

        "Program scale may impact outcomes through different mechanisms. On the one hand, increases in scale may lead to an adverse impact on implementation quality leading to lower effectiveness. A recent -analysis of development programs, including those that focus on microfinance, financial literacy and women\u2019s empowerment, concluded that larger programs and programs that were implemented by governments had lower effects (). Indeed, program-specific evidence on other development interventions suggests that many programs that are successful at a smaller scale fail to achieve similar positive effects after scaling up (, ). More recent evidence indicates that in communities could explain the larger positive effects of interventions implemented by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) relative to interventions implemented by governments ().\nOn the other hand, service scale may also alter the costs of service provision if programs are able to achieve (). Previous evidence from health programs and interventions aiming to reduce gender-based violence indeed show that the average costs of these programs reduce significantly when they reach a larger number of program participants (, , , ). At the same time, more complex interventions like multidimensional livelihoods and financial inclusion interventions, may achieve diseconomies of scale if the programs face input or labor supply constraints (). The scale-up of SHG programs and other development interventions could either increase or decrease their cost-effectiveness depending on how scale changes the implementation quality, effectiveness, and costs of programming. In the absence of cost information, and specifically cost information about programs delivered at different levels of scale, the of large-scale programs as well as the policy implications of the studies showing an adverse relationship between impact and scale remain unclear.",
        "Understanding how costs change with scale is challenging since the nature of program and the number of activities often change as programs expand. Studies have pointed out that a good way to differentiate between short-run and long-run costs is by exploiting time-series data on program costs \u2013 a challenging endeavor given the lack of data on costs over time (). While a large dataset with data on costs of multiple programs over many periods and program components would be ideal, such data is almost never readily available. Instead, most studies observe cost data at one point in time or have limited data on the costs of different program components precluding researchers from studying how costs vary with changes in both program scale and program scope. Therefore, even a small increase in the number of cost data points over time can significantly increase the evidence-base on how costs change with scale, especially when data include costs of different program components. Time-series data are particularly important for women\u2019s groups like SHGs, that usually start with the goal of increased financial access to women, but with time, often include additional layers like health or farm and non-farm-based livelihoods initiatives.",
        "We examine the costs of increasing both the scope as well as the scale of services related to expanding \u2019s outreach of the SHG program. To analyze program scale, we consider costs from expanding the geographic supply of the program by adding more participants over time across the state. To analyze program scope, we study component-specific costs of the program, differentiating between expenditures related to key program activities (community mobilization and financial inclusion), and expenditures related to overall operations and management. We also study the changes in total program costs in relationship to core program activities, including the federation of SHGs, such as the formation of SHGs, VOs, CLFs, and bank linkages.\nWe estimate average program costs as costs per SHG woman targeted under the program, treating each  member added as an additional program output. While not all women received the same level of services with the same intensity, we estimate an average cost equivalent to an \u201cIntent to Treat\u201d cost \u2013 that is, expenditure per woman with access to potential program services. From \u2019s expenditure components discussed earlier, we consider three expenditure components \u2013 Community Institution Development, Special Technical Assistance Fund, and Project Management. We do not include Community Investment Funds when studying the relationship of costs with scale because it is disbursed to SHGs or their federations as a one-time grant or capital based on need and is usually a fixed amount (of INR 66,000, on average, [])."

The threshold for large projects in Fiscal Year 2013 is $67,500 (, Oct. 9, 2012). This proposed rule only affects large projects. \nProject Worksheets for large projects are developed by a FEMA Project Specialist, working with the applicant/subgrantee, and are submitted to a FEMA Public Assistance Coordinator (PAC) Crew Leader for review and processing. Large projects are funded on documented actual costs; however, work typically is not complete at the time of project approval. Therefore, FEMA obligates large project grants based on estimated costs. The obligation process is the process by which funds are made available to the grantee. The funds reside in a Federal account until drawn down by the grantee and paid to the subgrantee as the project progresses and actual costs are incurred. If FEMA approves a revised scope of work, a revised Project Worksheet is issued with a revised estimate, and funds are obligated or deobligated based on the revised estimate.\n### B. Traditional Method for Estimating Eligible Cost\nThis section describes the traditional method FEMA has used to estimate a project's eligible costs.

              "#  What are the major federal safety net programs in the U.S.? A summary of efforts to reduce poverty in the U.S.\nSome of these programs are entitlements. Everyone can expect to receive an Earned Income Tax Credit if they qualify. Other programs, like the nutrition assistance programs SNAP and WIC, only benefit those who claim them before the budgeted funds run out.\nHere is a timeline and summary of selected safety net programs in the U.S.\n### 1935: The Social Security Act\nPart of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal legislation, the original act included grants to states for unemployment compensation, aid to dependent children and public health. Today, Social Security is the largest safety net program in the U.S. In 2017 it will reach an estimated 62 million Americans with $955 billion in benefits.\nFor more information visit the \nUnemployment insurance was a part of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s 1935 Social Security Act. Today\u2019s U.S. Department of Labor Unemployment Insurance (UI) programs provide benefits to eligible workers who become unemployed through no fault of their own and who meet certain requirements.\nThe program is a unique federal-state partnership, based on Federal law, but administered by individual states. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that UI benefits totaled $32 2016 when the unemployment rate averaged 4.6 percent. \nFor more information about Unemployment Insurance, visit the \nThis pre-school education program was a part of the 1964 Economic Opportunity Act that was designed to reduce disparities among young children. The 1994 Head Start Act Amendments established the Early Head Start program, which expanded the benefits of early childhood development to low income families with children under three years old.",
              "In 2016 the program served up to 900,000 mostly low-income children per year with total federal spending of over $8.7 billion. While the program\u2019s effectiveness has been criticized by prominent researchers, show the benefits of Head Start, especially for children at the bottom of the skill distribution. \nFor more information on Head Start, visit the [Office of Head Start online](http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs/)\n### 1964: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\nThe first Food Stamp program ran from 1939-43, but the program we know today was established with the 1964 Food Stamp Act. The program is now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and served 44.2 million people with $66.5 billion in benefits in 2016.\nStudies co-authored by Research Affiliate Hilary Hoynes found that SNAP contributed to increases in birth weights, but also found that the benefit is associated with fewer hours worked.\nFor more information on the program, visit the [Food and Nutrition Service website for SNAP](http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/snapmain.htm)\nThese health programs were established with amendments to the Social Security Act in 1965. Today, Medicare provides health insurance for people over 65 years of age and some younger than that but who have certain disabilities or diseases. Medicaid is a Federal and state partnership that provides health coverage for people with low income.\nDuring 2015, enrollment in Medicare averaged about 55.3 million people who received $615.6 billion in benefits. In fiscal year 2015, total Medcaid spending was $552.3 billion, of which federal spending for Medicaid was $348 billion ($301 billion covered benefits for enrollees). States funded the additional $220 billion. Approximately 68.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 2015.\nFor more information about Medicare and Medicaid, visit the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services online](http://www.cms.gov/)",
              "For more information on Pell Grants, visiting the [U.S. Department of Education online](http://www2.ed.gov/programs/fpg/index.html)\n### 1975: The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)\nThe EITC is a tax credit that benefits working people who have low to moderate income, especially families. In 2015, the EITC reached 46.2 million tax filers at a total cost of $58.8 billion. Since EITC benefits are not considered income for other Federal benefit programs, they do not jeopardize recipients who qualify for other assistance like SNAP or Medicaid.\nResearch has shown that the impacts of the EITC are wider than raising families out of poverty. A by Center Research Affiliates Hilary Hoynes and Douglas Miller found that it also increased birth weights and reduced low birth-weight births.\nFor more information on the EITC, visit the \n### 1996: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\nTANF issues federal grants to states for programs that provide temporary benefits to families with children when the income does not provide for the family\u2019s basic needs. Programs include job preparation, family planning and other benefits as well as cash assistance.\nThe program replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC), which was established by the 1935 Social Security Act. In 1996 it was replaced by TANF as part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act welfare reform that would change the face of the safety net in the U.S. While AFDC allowed families to receive assistance for as long as they were eligible, TANF imposes a five-year limit on benefits.\nWhile the federal government funds a share of state TANF programs, it leaves it to states to determine the shape those programs take. In 2015, the total Federal cost for TANF was about $16 billion, with an additional $15.3 billion coming from states. That year, the program provided cash assistance to about 3 million people."

It is historically and commonly known as the Food Stamp Program, though all legal references to \"stamp\" and \"coupon\" have been replaced by \"EBT\" and \"card,\" referring to the refillable, plastic (EBT) cards that replaced the paper \"food stamp\" coupons. To be eligible for SNAP benefits, the recipients must have incomes below 130 percent of the poverty line, and also own few assets. Since the economic downturn began in 2008, the use of food stamps has increased. \nThe [Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIC_program \"WIC program\") (WIC) is a for healthcare and nutrition of low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and infants and children under the age of five.

AIAN and Hispanic people had the highest uninsured rates at 18.7% and 17.9%, respectively, as of 2023. Uninsured rates for NHPI (12.8%) and Black people (9.7%) also were higher than the rate for their White counterparts (6.5%). These differences in uninsured rates are driven by lower rates of private coverage among these groups. Medicaid coverage helps to narrow these differences but does not fully offset them.\nMedicaid and CHIP coverage help fill gaps in private coverage and reduce coverage disparities for children, but some disparities in children\u2019s coverage remain (Figure 2). Medicaid and CHIP cover larger shares of children than adults, reflecting more expansive eligibility levels for children. This coverage helps fill gaps in private coverage, with over half of Hispanic, Black, AIAN, and NHPI children covered by Medicaid and CHIP. However, there remain some disparities in children\u2019s coverage. For example, AIAN children are about three times as likely as their White counterparts to lack coverage (12.7% vs. 4.0%). Moreover, Hispanic children are more than twice as likely as White children to be uninsured (8.5% vs. 4.0%).",
              "under the age of 65, uninsured rates in states that have not expanded Medicaid are higher than rates in expansion states across most racial and ethnic groups as of 2023 (Figure 3). The differences in coverage rates between Black and Hispanic people compared with White people are larger in non-expansion states compared with expansion states. However, the relative risk of being uninsured for Black, Hispanic, and Asian people compared with White people is similar in expansion and non-expansion states. For example, Hispanic people under the age of 65 years old are roughly 2.6 times as likely as their White counterparts to lack coverage in both expansion and non-expansion states. Uninsured rates for AIAN people are similar in expansion and non-expansion states. Overall, the differences in coverage by expansion status are primarily driven by differences in coverage rates among adults ages 18-64. However, White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, and NHPI children in non-expansion states also are more likely to be uninsured than those in expansion states. For example, 13.5% of Hispanic children in non-expansion states are uninsured compared to 6.1% of Hispanic children in expansion states.\n## Eligibility for Coverage among the Uninsured as of 2023"

              "Our findings were consistent with previous studies. Buchmueller and Levy evaluated the ACA\u2019s impact on racial and ethnic disparities in health insurance coverage and access to care, and found a large number of adults remain uninsured, and the uninsurance rate among blacks and Hispanics was substantially higher than the rate among whites []. Another study assessed the insurance patterns and instability from 2006 to 2016, and found despite the post-ACA instability reduction, over 25% of the U.S. population continued to have insurance gaps over a two-year period; and found disparities continued to exist between income groups, race/ethnicities, and regions []. Compared with the above evidence, our results added further empirical evidence on the combined effect of race and income on health insurance coverage in the US, and the uniqueness of our study was looking at the influence of multiple vulnerability traits together rather than separately as other studies did.\nThese findings have significant policy implications. To expand insurance coverage and eliminate racial disparities as called for by Healthy People 2030, concerted and targeted efforts are needed to both improve economic status and address disparities towards racial/ethnic minorities. To maximize limited resources, policymakers should target insurance coverage for the most vulnerable subpopulations, i.e., those with a convergence of predisposing, enabling, and need attributes of risk. The findings placed quantitative content to the theoretical framework of the vulnerability mode. As shown in this study, these are individuals who have low income and are racial/ethnic minorities. Significant progress at reducing disparities in care and quality across racial and ethnic groups is unlikely to be fulfilled without significantly expanding insurance coverage for this most vulnerable group."

              "#  Who Goes Without Health Insurance? Who Is Most Likely to Be Uninsured?\nThis chapter provides a portrait of the uninsured, to support the Committee's future reports about the consequences of uninsurance. Here, the Committee reviews and summarizes the published literature about what socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic characteristics describe the uninsured both collectively and as members of groups in the general population that are more likely than average to be uninsured. Supporting methodological information and data tables provide the numbers behind the general statements in the text and can be found in Appendixes and . All estimates are for persons uninsured during calendar year 1999 (the most recent available Current Population Survey data), unless otherwise indicated.\nThe large number and variety of Americans who are uninsured underscore the Committee's conclusion that the voluntary, employment-based approach to insurance coverage in the United States functions less like a system and more like a sieve. There are many ways to slip through the holes. People of all ages, levels of education, and in all states may be uninsured, although socioeconomic and geographic factors that affect coverage are highly correlated. One's chances of being uninsured increase if one works in an occupation or in an employment sector where employers are less likely to offer a health benefit, if one is self-employed or works for a small private-sector firm, or if one has too low an income to afford coverage.\nThe final section of this chapter includes estimates of the relative importance of key social, economic, demographic, and geographic characteristics to one's likelihood of being uninsured, based on a new multivariate analysis of published data. Most of the studies that the Committee reviewed are based on two-way (bivariate) analyses of a characteristic and the probability that an individual with that characteristic will be uninsured.",
              "Throughout the chapter, the Committee addresses two questions together:     \nWhat are the characteristics of the uninsured population?     \nWho is most likely to be uninsured?\nThe distribution of socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic differences in the general population under age 65 affects how these characteristics are distributed among the uninsured population because the relative size of specific population groups affects their representation among the uninsured. For example, the uninsured for the urban population is the same as that of the rural population, although four out of five uninsured people live in urban areas, reflecting the predominance of urban populations nationally.\n## HOW SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECT COVERAGE\nFull-time, full-year employment offers families the best chances of acquiring and keeping health insurance, as does an annual income of at least a moderate level (greater than 200 percent of the federal poverty level []). Insured status correlates highly with many aspects of employment, including work status, income level, educational attainment, occupation, and employer characteristics such as firm size and employment sector.\nEight out of every ten uninsured people are members of families with at least one wage earner, and six out of every ten uninsured people are wage earners themselves. Nonetheless, members of families without wage earners are much more likely to be uninsured than members of families with wage earners.",
              "Lower-income parents face income and other eligibility criteria that may prevent them from qualifying for , although their children may be covered. This may result in a family being partially insured. Since welfare reform in 1996, lower-income parents have been losing insurance coverage, with the de cline in public coverage greater than the increase in employment-based coverage. The impact falls disproportionately on lower-income mothers (Guyer and Mann, 1999; Garrett and Holahan, 2000; Klein, 2000; Guyer et al., 2001). Only 33 percent of women who move from public assistance to employment obtain coverage through their employer (Garrett and Holahan, 2000). Among low-income people (less than 100 percent of ), working parents are twice as likely to be uninsured as nonworking parents because nonworking, single parents often have very young children and are more likely to have Medicaid coverage (Guyer and Mann, 1999).\n## OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN COVERAGE\nThe nature and type of labor force participation determine whether individuals and family members obtain employment-based coverage. Foreign-born persons and members of ethnic and racial minority groups are more likely than average to be uninsured, although their smaller numbers in the general population mean that uninsured rates overall are dominated by the rates for U.S.-born citizens and non-Hispanic whites.\nMost uninsured people are U.S. citizens by birth (native-born residents comprise about 90 percent of the general population). The relatively small proportion of the general population comprised of naturalized citizens and noncitizens (immigrants) is significantly more likely than U.S.-born residents to be uninsured, although immigrants' uninsured rates decline with increasing length of residency in the United States."

Taking a close look at the data could illuminate ways to help expand health coverage to people who remain uninsured, from dismantling barriers to eligibility and enrollment to improving the scope and accessibility of outreach and enrollment assistance. The overall uninsured rate reached record lows in 2022, but to achieve further coverage gains and to reach racial equity in health coverage, it is essential to sustain and expand upon successful, more targeted policies.",

While it is true that health coverage rates vary across racial and ethnic groups, limiting analysis to broad racial categories \u2014 as is often the practice \u2014 can conceal the diverse experiences of communities within them. Disaggregating race and ethnicity into smaller groups could improve response rates on race/ethnicity questions, shed further light on health inequities, and uncover community needs.\nReasons that data are often not disaggregated into racial and ethnic subgroups can include sample sizes that are too small for precise estimation, concerns over privacy and surveillance, and the risk that users of the data will misattribute differences between groups and not account for the context of inequities such as racism, discrimination, and other structural barriers to opportunity. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which sets national race and ethnicity reporting standards, cites a lack of consensus in terminology as an additional barrier to adding racial and ethnic categories to the minimum federal reporting requirements."

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites. \nThe Office of Child Care (OCC) administers the Child Care and Development Fund program (CCDF), which is the primary federal funding source to help families with low incomes access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children. Access to affordable high-quality child care has numerous short- and long-term benefits for children, families, and society, supporting child and family well-being in a manner that fuels prosperity and strengthens communities and the economy. Child care is a necessity for most families with young children and reliable access leads to better parental earnings and employment and supports parents' educational attainment.\nCCDF is the primary federal funding source for child care subsidies to help eligible low-income working families access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children.\nThe passage of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of 2014 reauthorized the law governing CCDF. The law defines health and safety requirements for child care providers, outlines family-friendly eligibility policies, expands quality improvement efforts, and ensures that parents and the public have transparent information about the child care choices available to them. Under the law, States continue to have flexibility within federal guidelines over key policy levers\u2014including subsidy payment rates, co-payment amounts contributed by the family, income thresholds for determining eligibility, and quality improvement investments.\n### Child Care Services Funded by CCDF",
              "Subsidized child care services are available to eligible families through certificates (vouchers), or grants and contracts with providers. Under the law, States must establish eligibility policies, including a period of at least 12 months before eligibility is re-determined, that promote continuity of care for children and families. The program provides parents with the choice of a range of provider settings and types\u2014including centers, family child care homes, relatives, and faith-based providers. Parents may select a participating child care provider that satisfies applicable state and local requirements, including health and safety requirements. Under the law, States must: ensure that these health and safety requirements address key areas (such as first aid and CPR); require that providers receive training in these areas; complete comprehensive criminal background checks; and conduct monitoring that includes annual inspections. Approximately 1.3 million children receive a child care subsidy from the CCDF program every month.\nA portion of CCDF funds must be used to improve the quality of child care and other additional services to parents, such as resource and referral counseling regarding the selection of child care providers. The 2014 law increases the minimum amount that States are required to spend for quality activities, and includes new funding for improving the quality of care for infants and toddlers. To improve the health and safety of available child care, CCDF lead agencies provide training, grants and loans to providers; improved monitoring; compensation projects; and other innovative programs. Many lead agencies are making systemic investments, such as developing quality rating and improvement systems and professional development systems. Tribes may use a portion of their funds to construct child care facilities provided there is no reduction in the current level of child care services.",
              "The CCDF allows states to serve families through a single, integrated child care subsidy program under the rules of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. States coordinate CCDF with Head Start, pre-k, and other early childhood programs. States can also transfer a portion of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families dollars to CCDF, or spend TANF directly for child care.\n### State and Tribal Child Care Plans\nAll states, territories and tribes must submit comprehensive plans every three years and conduct public hearings to invite public comment.\nA portion of CCDF is used for child care research, demonstration and evaluation activities. These funds are increasing the capacity for child care research at the national, state and local levels while addressing critical questions with implications for children and families. Funds have been awarded to support individual project areas, including policy research, research partnerships, research scholars and a web-based archive called Child Care and Early Education Research Connections.\nA small portion of the CCDF is used by the Office of Child Care to provide technical assistance to grantees. Its technical assistance network is designed to address the needs of states, territories and tribes administering CCDF.\nCCDF is authorized under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act (CCDBG) which was enacted under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The CCDBG Act was amended and reauthorized by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, and again by the CCDBG Act of 2014. CCDF made $9.5 billion available to states, territories, and tribes in fiscal year 2021. In addition, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriation Act (or CRRSA Act) provided $10 billion in supplemental CCDF monies to address the impacts of the coronavirus."

              "More from Bipartisan Policy Center\n\nThe Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the largest source for child care. CCDF funds are distributed to states, tribes, and territories to help them administer child care assistance programs for low-income working families. As conversations around federal and child care access dominate news cycles, understanding how child care is funded is key.\nCCDF was created in 1996 to help low-income workers child care. The fund is comprised of two financing mechanisms: the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) and Child Care Entitlement to States (CCES). CCDF combines CCDBG discretionary funds and CCES mandatory and matching funds into block grants for states, tribes, and territories to subsidize the cost of child care\u2014streamlining a one stop shop for administering and governing funding. It is housed in the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Child Care.\nCCDF allows states to provide eligible families with a subsidy to help pay for a licensed child care program for their child, so that they can work, attend job training, or enroll in an educational program. States are required to have one department, a \u201cLead Agency,\u201d responsible for creating and managing CCDF funds.\nLead Agencies must follow broad federal guidelines for eligibility but they have a significant amount of autonomy to restrict their own state regulations. CCDF federal guidelines require the child families are seeking assistance for to meet the following requirements:\n  * Be under 13 years of age;\n  * Live with one or more parents who are working or enrolled in a job training or education program;\n  * Live in a family whose income does not exceed 85% of the State Median Income (SMI); and\n  * Live in a family whose assets do not exceed $1 million.",
              "Lead Agencies often shrink eligibility for child care subsidies through stricter requirements on family income and work provisions. Based on the 2025-2027 state plans, submitted to ACF every three years to show compliance with CCDF regulations, 31 states restrict their family income requirement to lower than 85% of SMI. Stricter requirements are often necessary due to high demand for child care assistance and funding constraints.\nCCDF also directs Lead Agencies to implement health and safety regulations, child care workforce development systems, quality improvement activities, and other actions that promote the accessibility of child care for all. HHS last updated CCDF regulations in .\n## Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG)\nThe Child Care and Development Block Grant, perhaps the most well-known aspect of CCDF, is only one part of the federal money allocated through CCDF. CCDBG funds and regulates child care services across all 50 states with discretionary funding passed by Congress through annual appropriations bills.\nCCDBG discretionary funds are administered through CCDF to each state based on the following funding allocation formula:\n  * The number of children under age five living in the state;\n  * The number of children living in the state who qualify for the National School Lunch Program; and\n  * The state per capita income.",
              "The allocation of matching funds per state is determined by the number of children under age 13 living in the state. The Lead Agency must \u201cmatch\u201d those funds with their own funding, this time using their Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate.\nOccasionally, CCDF administers more than just CCDBG and CCES funding. States can transfer up to 30% of their [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BPC_ECI-TANF-FY21-Report_RV22023.pdf) block grant funds directly to CCDF\u2014but not all states do. In FY 2023, states transferred a total of $1 billion from TANF to CCDF, allowing for their child care assistance programs to serve more low-income, working families.\nOriginally created to support low-income working parents, CCDF\u2019s role has grown, becoming an integral program supporting accessibility, stability, and quality within the wider child care landscape. Understanding the fiscal intricacies of CCDF is crucial for creating future policy recommendations and the role the federal government plays in supporting child care access for all families.\nYour source for bipartisan policy updates and insights."

Last reauthorized in 2014, CCDF is comprised of both a mandatory component (not subject to the annual appropriations process), the Child Care Entitlement to States (CCES), and a discretionary portion, the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), which Congress must fund every fiscal year. In FY 2024/2025, CCDBG received $8.75 billion and CCES received $3.5 billion for a total of $12.35 billion in CCDF funding.\nCounty governments are responsible for administering CCDF in at least eight states, according to the most recent available state plans: Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. In FY 2024, these eight states represented $2.2 billion in federal expenditures (25 percent). County governments in these states may set policy related to eligibility, sliding fee scales, and payment rates as well as perform eligibility determinations, issue provider payments, connect parents with child care and more. Counties administering CCDF may contribute county general revenue funds to help meet the required non-federal match for the CCES.",
              "In December 2024, Congress passed a disaster supplemental relief package (P.L. 118-158) that included $500 million in CCDBG funds to address immediate childcare needs and support recovery efforts. Counties deeply appreciate the inclusion of CCDBG funding in the supplemental, and call for continued investments in child care to ensure the long-term well-being and resiliency of our communities. In FY 2024/2025, CCDBG received $8.75 billion and CCES received $3.5 billion for a total of $12.35 billion in CCDF funding. Funding for CCDBG remained at levels equal to FY 2025 in the President\u2019s FY 2026 Budget Request.\n  * The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the federal government\u2019s funding source for child care subsidies to help eligible low-income families access child care and improve the quality of child care for all children.\n  * Eight states delegate CCDF funding and administration to county governments: Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin.\n  * Access to high-quality, affordable child care is critical for promoting positive child development as well as encouraging workforce participation and access to education for low-income parents.\n  * Limited program resources, strict eligibility rules and expensive quality standards can challenge the ability of counties to meet the needs of local parents through CCDF.\n  * Counties urge Congress to provide increased funding for both the mandatory and discretionary titles within CCDF to help us meet quality standards, invest in child care infrastructure, boost supply and serve eligible families.\n  * Congress should provide counties with increased authority to set income eligibility, establish sliding fee scales and determine other eligibility factors related to work and education to best meet the needs of local families."

If their tax liability is less than the value of their child tax credit, they may be eligible for a refundable credit calculated using the earned income formula. Under this formula, a family is eligible for a refund equal to 15% of their earnings in excess of $2,500, up to $1,700 per child, the maximum amount of the refundable portion of the credit. The credit phases out for unmarried parents with income over $200,000 and married couples with income over $400,000. The amount of the credit by income for a taxpayer with one qualifying child is illustrated below.",
              "## Child Tax Credit Amount by Income Level\nInternal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 24.  \nThe child tax credit was created in 1997 by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 () to help ease the financial burden that families incur when they have children. Like other tax credits, the child tax credit reduces tax liability dollar-for-dollar of the value of the credit. Initially the child tax credit was a nonrefundable credit for most families. A nonrefundable tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer's income tax liability to zero. In contrast, a refundable tax credit can exceed a taxpayer's income tax liability, providing a cash payment to low- and some moderate-income taxpayers who owe little or no income tax. \nThe child tax credit has undergone significant changes over time. At the end of 2017, Congress expanded the credit through 2025 as part of the TCJA (). The TCJA temporarily doubled the maximum credit amount and more than tripled the income level at which the credit begins to phase out. It also made changes to the refundable portion of the credit, including increasing the refundable credit amount from $1,000 to $1,400 per child (adjusted annually for inflation; $1,700 in 2025) and lowering the refundability threshold from $3,000 to $2,500. Although these changes were scheduled to expire at the end of 2025, the FY2025 reconciliation law () made them permanent. That law also permanently increased the maximum child tax credit from $2,000 per child to $2,200 per child, while indexing it to inflation. \nData from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) indicate that the total dollar amount of the child tax credit has increased significantly since enactment from approximately $23 billion in 1998 to $118 billion in 2022, with the largest increase coming after the TCJA expansions and the one-year expansion of the credit in the American Rescue Plan Act () in 2021, as illustrated below.",
              "## Taxpayers with Children, by Income Level in\n% of All Taxpayers With Children |  % of Taxpayers who Receive the Child Credit |  Child Tax Credit as % of After-Tax Income |  Average Child Credit per Taxpayer  \n---|---|---|---  \nThe child tax credit was created in 1997 by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 () to help ease the financial burden that families incur when they have children. Like other tax credits, the child tax credit reduces tax liability dollar for dollar of the value of the credit. Initially the child tax credit was a nonrefundable credit for most families. A nonrefundable tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer's income tax liability to zero, while a refundable tax credit can exceed a taxpayer's income tax liability, providing a cash payment primarily to low-income taxpayers who owe little or no income tax. \nOver the past 20 years, legislative changes have significantly changed the credit, transforming it from a generally nonrefundable credit available only to the middle and upper-middle class, to a refundable credit that more low-income families are eligible to claim. Most recently, at the end of 2017, Congress expanded the credit as part of , often referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJA. The law significantly expanded eligibility for and the amount of the credit for many higher-income taxpayers, with a more modest expansion for lower-income taxpayers. This change generally offsets the suspension of personal exemptions for those with dependents. made these changes permanent, and also increased the maximum credit from 2025 onward.\nThis report provides an overview of the credit under current law and also provides some summary data on these benefits.

              "The recent , the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) passed by Congress and signed by President Trump in July, extended and expanded provisions of the [2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/tax/) (TCJA) that otherwise would have expired at the end of 2025, and included additional relief and support for American families. to the (CTC) drew interest from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle prior to the final package emerged as one of the primary levers to increase support for . Now that the reconciliation package has become law, it is important to understand how the CTC changed, how it stacks up against previous expansions, and how the new law will impact families.\nThe new law made the base credit permanent and increased it to $2,200 per child effective in 2025 (and adjusted for inflation in years after). It also made permanent the phase-out threshold rate of $200,000 ($400,000 for taxpayers married filing jointly) and the $500 nonrefundable credit for non-child dependents. The bill also continues to adjust the refundable part of the credit for inflation each year (in 2025, the maximum refundable credit is $1,700 per child).\nThe bill adjusted the eligibility requirements to now require valid Social Security numbers (SSNs) for both the qualifying child the taxpayer claiming the child (previously, the law only required an SSN for the child). In the case of a joint return, only one parent needs to have an SSN to be eligible to claim the CTC. highlights the changes to the CTC in OBBB, and the proposed version in the House reconciliation bill compared to prior laws.\n### _Table 1: Enhanced CTC Comparisons to Prior Proposals and Law_\n## Proposed Ways and Means Bill (2025)\n$2,200 per child in 2025 (inflation-adjusted annually, starting 2026) | $2,500 per child (temporary); reverts to $2,000 (inflation-adjusted) after 2028",
              "The changes to the CTC will impact families differently, depending on their income levels and eligibility status. For example, the reconciliation package\u2019s more stringent SSN requirements mentioned above will have an impact on the number of people eligible for the credit moving forward. The Tax Policy Center estimated that 500,000 children who would otherwise be considered eligible to the credit if no parent can produce an SSN to comply with the new requirement.\nThe CTC provisions will only partially aid low-income families, despite the increased credit amount, since the CTC\u2019s income parameters remain unchanged. And as the CTC is not fully refundable and many low-income families owe little to nothing in federal income taxes, some families do not benefit from the increases to the base amount of the credit.\nAn estimated [23.8 million children will benefit](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/house-and-senate-plans-boost-child-tax-credit-could-help-more-low-income-families) from the larger CTC; however, those from households with lower incomes will see a smaller impact. shows the credit schedule in 2025 for a single parent with one child. Under the new law, families with a lower adjusted gross income (AGI) between $0 and $26,000 receive the same credit as they would under TCJA in 2025. At an AGI between $27,000 and $243,000, families benefit more from the $200 boost than they did from the TCJA credit, before it phases out.\n### _Figure 2: CTC Schedule for a Single Parent of One Child Under TCJA and OBBB_"

              "* Read the latest Daily Deductions \n_This post has been corrected: The number of children in families that cannot receive the full CTC because their parents do not earn enough is 19 million, not 30 million._\nThe (CTC)\u2014the largest tax benefit supporting families with children\u2014 has swung through big changes in recent years. Generally, the pattern of expansion has been for the credit to be increased to a fixed level and then stagnate, which leads to rising costs eroding the value of the credit. \nThe 2025 reconciliation act, or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), differed from these recent expansion efforts. It permanently increased the maximum credit amount to $2,200 per child and indexed it for inflation. \nA permanent, bigger CTC is good news for many. OBBBA made the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u2019s (TCJA\u2019s) expansion of the CTC permanent, preventing the CTC from dropping from $2,000 to $1,000 per child ([alongside other related changes to family tax provisions](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tcja-didnt-change-child-benefits-most-families-children-very-much)). And, more than that, the OBBBA increased the maximum credit to $2,200, which will now grow with inflation after 2025 (Figure 1). These changes [help middle- and high-income families](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/children-deserve-more-shutdown-threats-and-continuing-resolutions) offset the taxes they owe.\nThese changes do little for families with low incomes, because the credit's pre-OBBBA phase-in rules remain in place. And, as under prior law, that amount grows each year with inflation. But the amount of credit a family can receive beyond taxes owed is limited to 15 percent of earnings above $2,500. A larger credit with these same phase-in rules means that more children now live in families that cannot receive the full CTC because their parents do not earn enough. TPC estimates that number jumped from about to under the new law,about 30 percent of all children.",
              "And there\u2019s more bad news. Average benefits will decline slightly under the new law for the lowest-income families with children\u2014largely because about additional children with Social Security numbers (SSNs) who cannot be claimed by will now be ineligible (Figure 2). Rather than qualifying for the CTC, they can get\u2014at most\u2014a $500 credit that can only be used to offset taxes owed. Average benefits for middle-income and higher-income families with children will increase by about $200.\nA basic principle of the CTC is that all else equal, larger families receive larger benefits. This is true for most higher-income families, but not low-income families. Because of the credit\u2019s , 1.1 million children in low-income families with multiple children will get the same credit as if their families had only 1 child under age 17. This could be changed by phasing the credit in faster for larger families who have modest earnings.\nIn all, the changes to the CTC were a mixed bag for families with children. A larger, permanent, inflation-indexed credit helps many families plan with greater certainty. But, despite research suggesting that investments in children with low incomes more than many other social policies, millions of children in low-income families remain excluded, along with the economic returns that come from investing in them.\nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)\nChild tax credit (CTC)/Child and dependent care tax credit (CDCTC)\nSubscribe to our newsletters today."

              "The Tax Policy Center estimates that slightly less than 90 percent of families with children received an average CTC of $2,520 in 2025. The average credit exceeds the maximum per child credit because families can have more than one child. Families with children in all income groups benefited from the CTC, but families in the lowest income quintile were least likely to benefit because fewer of them have sufficient earnings to qualify for the credit. Just under three-quarters of families in the lowest income quintile were eligible for a CTC, receiving an average credit of $1,610. The average credit was the smallest for this quintile because low-income families are most likely to be limited to the refundable portion of the credit, which was capped at $1,700 in 2025 rather than the full $2,200 limit for the nonrefundable credit (figure 2).\nThe percentage of families with children receiving the credit and the average credit received were the highest among moderate- and middle-income families. The share of families with children claiming a CTC was 93 percent in the second income quintile, 98 percent in third quintile, and 99 percent in the fourth quintile. The proportion of families with children receiving a credit then drops to 78 percent in the highest income quintile because the credit phases out at high incomes (figure 3).\nThe CTC improves the well-being of low-income families with children. The Census Bureau estimates that along with the EITC, the refundable portion of the CTC\u2014the ACTC\u2014lifted 6.4 million people out of poverty in 2023, including 2 million children. Researchers at Columbia estimated that in 2023, the CTC reduced child poverty by 17.1 percent (from a child poverty rate of 16.5 percent without any CTC to 13.7 percent).\n#### Recent History of the CTC",
              "For low-income families, the refundable portion of the credit has also expanded over this time period. Before 2001, the CTC was generally nonrefundable. EGTRRA made part of the credit refundable based on earnings beginning in 2001 with the refundable portion (i.e., the ACTC) available to low-income families with earnings over $10,000 (this amount was indexed for inflation). As a result of changes made in response to the Great Recession, this threshold was temporarily reduced to $8,500 for 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) further reduced this threshold to $3,000 for 2009 and 2010. Along with the Bush-era tax cut changes discussed above, the $3,000 threshold was also extended temporarily after 2010 and ultimately made permanent by Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act.\nThe refundable portion of the CTC under EGTRRA was originally designed in 2001 to coordinate with the earned income tax credit (EITC). Once earnings reached $10,020 for families with two children in 2001, there was no further increase in the EITC. The earnings threshold for the refundable CTC was set at $10,000 so families could now receive a subsidy for earnings in excess of that amount. Like the earning threshold amounts for the EITC, the $10,000 earnings threshold was indexed for inflation. When the earnings threshold for the refundable CTC was reduced\u2014first to $8,500 in 2008 and then to $3,000 beginning in 2009\u2014that link between the phase-in of the refundable CTC and the EITC was broken.\nBoddupalli, Aravind and Luisa Godinez-Puig. 2025. \u201c[\u2019One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019 Child Tax Credit](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/one-big-beautiful-bill-child-tax-credit-would-exclude-millions-american-children)[Would Exclude Millions of American Children.](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/one-big-beautiful-bill-child-tax-credit-would-exclude-millions-american-children)\u201d Washington, DC: Urban-Brookings Tax PolicyCenter.",

              "Further, the Mothers Pensions of the early 1900s showed positive long-term effects on children even though it is unlikely that the program greatly increased children\u2019s participation in child care centers because it predated the widespread adoption of center-based child care.\nWelfare time limits and other stringent welfare rules \u2014 which, in the absence of adequate child care or other services, often function more as a cut in assistance than as a path to stable employment \u2014 have been found to have harmful effects in other studies as well. One Delaware study found that the child protective services agency was more likely to become involved with families that had been randomly assigned to a program of lower welfare benefits, time limits, strict work requirements backed by financial penalties, and other limitations, relative to families receiving a modestly more generous traditional welfare program in the 1990s. The study was unable to determine whether these negative impacts on children were due to lower income, increased parental stress, or other factors associated with the stricter rules. The findings are consistent, however, with the previously mentioned study finding that child maltreatment and child protective services involvement fell after state and federal EITC expansions boosted family incomes. \n## More Research Is Needed, But Available Evidence Is Compelling \nThe bulk of evidence supports the conclusion that economic security programs play a strong role in helping low-income children, although there are exceptions. In science, including the social and behavioral sciences, individual studies are rarely conclusive by themselves; what matters is where the bulk of evidence lies. On balance, the evidence is strongly on the side of the importance of income assistance for low-income children.",

When programs provided more generous income assistance, the comparisons consistently showed better academic performance among young children transitioning into school. And the more the programs increased participating families\u2019 incomes, the more their children\u2019s academic achievement rose, relative to peers assigned to a traditional, less generous welfare program. (See Figure 2.) The five most generous programs raised average income by $1,700 a year.

              "There is still very limited evidence of direct causal links between poverty and children\u2019s development. However, , the [Baby\u2019s First Years project, is assessing the effects of providing direct monthly, unconditional cash payments (of $333) to parents of infants and toddlers experiencing poverty; this work has found that payments led to modest increases in brain activity levels associated with learning and development. Evidence is also provided by quasi-experimental research that investigated](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2115649119) relationships between [policies and interventions that increase income](https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/publication/2022/child-allowance/benefit-cost-analysis) and improvements in child outcomes. For example, evidence is provided by research on welfare reform: An conducted using data from four experimental studies of welfare reform found that increased income was associated with improved academic outcomes, although only for young children (under age 6). Studies of programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Medicaid also supply [causal evidence of the effects of poverty and income on outcomes and the positive impacts of mitigating poverty](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25246/a-roadmap-to-reducing-child-poverty).\nSimilarly, syntheses of studies examining the [effects of welfare reform initiatives](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1602768) on children\u2019s outcomes have found that programs that increased family income were associated with improvements in children\u2019s outcomes; by contrast, programs that increased employment without increasing income were not found to enhance outcomes. These findings suggest the value of social policies and programs that can reduce poverty and those that can reduce the effects of poverty.\n## Policies and Programs Can Reduce or Mitigate Child Poverty",
              "As noted, children living in or near poverty tend to have poorer health, lower academic attainment, and a greater chance of being poor in adulthood, relative to their higher-income peers. Rigorously conducted research\u2014both experimental and non-experimental\u2014suggest that [poverty itself is at the root of these differences](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25246/a-roadmap-to-reducing-child-poverty) because it affects most aspects of children\u2019s lives, ranging from food to housing to family interactions to school quality and neighborhood stress. However, there is a strong and growing research base that supports the efficacy of a wide range of programs and policies for reducing child poverty, mitigating its effects on development, and promoting long-term economic mobility. Such policies can include not just government safety net programs, but also , , and ; however, the research on the impact of these latter policies on child poverty rates is much more limited or findings are mixed (as in the case of ).\nMuch of the existing research on policy and program effectiveness has focused on the role of government programs in improving child and family economic well-being. Programs range from cash transfers and refundable tax credits, intended to directly supplement a family\u2019s income, to in-kind transfers, which typically provide direct services or vouchers that families can use to meet specific needs (such as nutrition, housing, health care, or child care needs). Both types of programs not only provide stability in a family\u2019s access to basic needs during economic downturns and unexpected hardships, but also support longer-term economic mobility by freeing up family resources that can be used to support parents\u2019 labor market participation and improve their access to higher-wage jobs. Such programs also include child care, transportation, and educational and skills investments.",
              "While the research evidence for the benefits of programs such as EITC and SNAP is robust, there is also a growing evidence base for a broader range of programs and services. Studies on the impact of Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program have found that these programs are linked to [increases in preventative care and reductions in preventable hospitalizations among children](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272704000076?casa_token=9gQfUIJ1aMAAAAAA:F5mF9DJa9QMUyUBwjWmp9aLR3BvdZA7sp9AKOBcNMH8kP9tKOkz6g-nQFD9D7zG5FMh4jjJLch4). Children who received Medicaid coverage in early childhood were more likely to have higher , higher , and improved as adults. Evidence on the effects of housing assistance is more mixed, but some evidence suggests that children who were young when their families received housing assistance (allowing them to move to low-poverty neighborhoods) had improved [educational attainment and adult earnings](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21156/w21156.pdf). Early education supports for families with low incomes, such as Head Start, can also promote family economic mobility by supporting increased parent and access to . At the same time, intergenerational economic mobility is supported by improved and among children served by these programs."

By elucidating the associations between benefit receipt and subsequent material hardship, this research gives direction for policy interventions and timely support for families.\n  * Effects of benefit receipt on material hardship.\n  * Findings show positive associations between benefit receipt and concurrent hardship.\n  * Early childhood benefits reduced material hardship likelihood in adolescence.",
              "Income assistance programmes have received noticeable focus from researchers (e.g., ) and policymakers (e.g., ) as viable initiatives to address material hardship at a policy-level. These programmes are typically provided by governmental organisations to help cover basic household expenses such as food, clothing, and housing (). The nature and extent of income support schemes varies widely across different countries and according to individual circumstances, but examples of these programmes include tax credits, one-off cash transfers, unemployment benefits, and pensions. Although material hardship does not necessarily coincide with income poverty (; ), robust evidence indicates that when families receive direct cash transfers, this income \u2018boost\u2019 can help mitigate hardship (; ; ; ). For example, a study by showed expansions to an income assistance programme decreased the likelihood of hardship. In their study, difference-in-differences estimates were used to examine the effects of the 2021 expansion to the Child Tax Credit (CTC) for families in the US. Their results suggested that receiving the CTC led to a significant 14-percentage point decrease in the likelihood of facing food hardship compared with the pre-treatment hardship rate. These findings align with the conceptual framework proposed by for programmes and policies addressing child poverty. This framework explains income support programmes which directly augment family income can be pivotal strategies for poverty reduction by assisting families to acquire basic necessities. We draw on this conceptual framework in this study to highlight initiatives aimed at creating economic opportunities for families as mechanisms through which sustainable solutions to material hardship can be realised. Accordingly, the present study focuses on benefit receipt in the form of means-tested benefits that provide direct cash transfers to families",
              "The long-term findings from this study contribute to the existing literature in several ways. Firstly, these results align with the conceptual framework proposed by , suggesting income assistance can help mitigate material hardship for families by augementing income. Furthermore, these findings add to the body of evidence finding income assistance programmes mitigate hardship (; ; ; ). Previous work found short-term effects of benefits in reducing medical hardship (; ). Our results extend on these findings in that a composite measure of material hardship was assessed. Therefore, our results show that benefit receipt may also be effective in mitigating material hardship as a broader construct. Secondly, previous research has highlighted the lasting effects of benefit programmes for maternal economic factors such as maternal debt reduction () and improvements for maternal wages (). The results from the current study extend on these findings by demonstrating another area where there are likely long-lasting intra-generational effects of benefits\u2014for material hardship. By explaining the temporal trend wherein early benefit recipients exhibited a decreasing likelihood of hardship nearly 12 years later, this study highlights the potential lasting effects of benefits in mitigating hardship for families with children."

Results suggest that the experience of material hardship \u2013 which regularly impact millions of American households \u2013 is significantly associated with diminished health. This highlights the important role of funding, expanding, and better targeting social welfare programs. Such an approach might include expansion of federal programs like SNAP and housing programs, where expanded access has been associated with a reduction in hardship [\u2013], grant programs for local governments who have shown effectiveness with programs like Housing First [], and/or incentives for nonprofit organizations that alleviate hardship through measures like meal services and utility bill assistance [,].\nBecause material hardship is often chronic, policymakers should focus on solutions that are preventative rather than just remedial. Some examples include weatherizing homes, expanding access to solar energy [], low-cost medical screenings, low-income tax credits, basic income programs [], and reduced or free school lunch programs []. Such approaches would reduce the incidence of material hardship but also likely mitigate the secondary effect of cost and strain on the medical system."

              "Cost estimation models are tools that can assist policy makers and stakeholders to explore the costs and distributional effects of potential policy changes. In this report, the policies examined are those intended to improve access to high-quality early care and education (ECE) opportunities. Cost estimation models address two types of costs: the costs to providers of offering early care and education and the subsidy costs to public and private entities supporting early care and education. Both types of cost are relevant to understanding the impact of policy options.\nDifferent approaches may be appropriate for various categories of audience or user, such as professional policy or budget analysts as opposed to stakeholders, program developers, or administrators. In some cases, it is necessary to have a \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d model that considers all age groups (e.g., infants, toddlers, prekindergartners) and all types of early care and education (center based, prekindergarten, or home based). In other cases, a pressing policy issue may be best addressed by a model specifically designed for a single age group or ECE type (such as promoting access of all 4-year-olds to prekindergarten). An important constraint on cost estimation modeling is the availability of reliable and generalizable data on the costs of certain elements. For example, although facilities are necessary, few data are available on the status of physical facilities and the costs required to rehabilitate or replace them.\nThis appendix first discusses the key attributes of cost estimation models and considerations for desirable outputs of models. It then briefly describes some of the currently available cost estimation models.\n## ATTRIBUTES OF COST ESTIMATION MODELS",
              "Cost estimation models vary in their scope and attributes. For example, models may be limited in their geographic area or the range of services included in the estimate; they may also differ in presenting dynamic or static estimates. A static model is likely to underestimate costs as families shift their patterns of utilization when the policies being modeled enhance quality and financial accessibility of ECE options. In other words, families may use more hours and more expensive types of ECE in response to those policies. A dynamic model can reflect the changes in utilization likely to result from the specified quality improvements or changes in prices, facilities, and locations and factor these changes into the estimated costs.\nThe target geographic areas specified are an important and variable feature of estimation models. Some models refer to a large area, such as a nation or a state; others specify local jurisdictions, such as a city, county, or school district. The focus may even be further narrowed to individual program sites. Consideration of larger areas allows more averaging of data and findings, while assessing smaller areas or individual programs may require more detailed data and analysis. It may also be useful to nest smaller areas within larger ones, such as showing costs for a state, along with costs for each county or school district within the state.\nThe range of services included is another distinction among models. Some programs or policies require inclusion of ancillary or comprehensive services such as physical health and developmental screening, family supports, and referral to housing or employment services. These services can be covered either by augmenting the staffing specified for ECE programs or treating them as a system-level cost in the ECE estimates.",
              "Different agencies within and across federal, state, and local jurisdictions use various budgeting categories. In general, models that derive costs from detailed components and allow aggregation into an array of user-specified categories are most useful. Such models allow the greatest flexibility for components to be added in variable ways to match diverse budget structures and to provide outputs categorized by desired components.\nThis wide range of output requirements on cost estimates may overwhelm the user of the model with details. One approach is to \u201cunfold\u201d different levels of detail, depending upon the needs of the user. Thus, one tab in a worksheet may display total dollar costs and personnel requirements. A second tab might break these totals into components such as child-age groups, ECE types, and personnel versus nonpersonnel costs. A third tab might show detailed costs by staff category, salaries versus benefits, and different types of nonpersonnel costs.\nThis section briefly describes the following examples of currently available cost estimator models:\n  * Human Services Policy Center Cost Simulation\n  * Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) Cost and Staffing Calculator\n  * Provider Cost of Quality Calculator (PCQC)\n  * Center for Benefit-Cost Studies in Education (CBCSE) Cost Tool Kit\n  * Center on Enhancing Early Learning Outcomes (CEELO) Cost of Preschool Quality (CPQ) Tool\n  * Quality Rating & Improvement System (QRIS) Cost Estimation Model\n  * The Standardized Early Childhood Development Costing Tool (SECT)\n  * Professional Development System Cost Analysis Tool"

              "AHRQ Estimating Costs grantees identified key cost elements based on the literature and interviews with primary care clinic leaders to develop a variety of tools, including user-friendly spreadsheets, questionnaires, and online forms, with detailed instructions on how to collect cost data. Some of these tools are quite detailed, while others focus only on key cost drivers (e.g., staff time for various activities). Examples of these tools are provided in .\nIn one example, Miller and colleagues integrated sensitivity analyses into their Web-based tool, allowing clinic leaders to estimate their costs under different scenarios, such as changing staff mix and adding or removing transformation activities. This tool can be used to estimate costs of transformation efforts either prospectively or retrospectively. Additional information about this tool is provided in .\nGrantees used qualitative and mixed methods to describe study settings and methods to estimate costs. The ABC method was used to calculate costs from the clinic\u2019s perspective, while gross-costing methods were used to estimate costs from the perspectives of the insurer, staff model HMO, and grant program that funded primary care transformation efforts.\n#### Analysis Methods to Describe Study Settings and Transformations Implemented\nMost AHRQ Estimating Costs grantees used a case study method to describe key setting characteristics and practice changes. To develop narratives describing the transformation efforts, grantees used rich qualitative data collected through interviews and observations, as well as quantitative data about clinic size, populations served, and other practice characteristics.",
              "Shi and colleagues used a global costing method including both trend analysis and regression modeling to estimate the costs incurred by a grant program to fund primary care transformation efforts across 110 clinics within 24 health care organizations in a large metropolitan area. Grant program expenditure data were used to estimate costs for each participating health care organization and clinic, including personnel, fringe benefits, travel, equipment, supplies, and alterations and renovations. Grant expenditure data were collected at 6-month intervals over a 3-year period. The trend analysis tracked total cost, cost per FTE physician, and cost per visit over the study period. The findings showed the incremental cost for clinics that achieved NCQA PCMH recognition versus clinics that did not. The incremental cost methodology is also discussed in Zuckerman et al.\nShi and colleagues then used a Mann-Whitney test to determine if clinics that achieved PCMH recognition were significantly different from clinics that did not. Propensity score matching was used to identify and retain for linear regression analysis pairs of clinics that were comparable at baseline and differed primarily in whether they attained PCMH recognition during the study period. Linear regression models were used to control for factors other than PCMH transformation that may have affected cost, such as total number of visits, number of FTE physicians, patient demographics (e.g., sex, race, and age), and percentage of uninsured patients. Based on the results of a Hausman test, a fixed effects model was selected to control for unobserved clinic characteristics not varying over time that may have biased results. A difference-in-difference method was used to estimate the difference in cost changes before and after PCMH transformation, comparing clinics that did and did not ultimately achieve PCMH recognition.",
              "A micro-costing (or ABC) approach creates a cost estimate based on a detailed analysis of resources used and the unit costs of each resource. This approach is appropriate to assess the costs of PCMH transformation efforts for most clinics. The benefits of the ABC approach are that it can be used either prospectively or retrospectively, does not require access to aggregate data, can account for all clinic-level resources spent as well as opportunity costs, and is computationally simple (i.e., it does not require statistical analysis software or skills). However, this method is time consuming for both investigators and clinic staff. This method is also susceptible to recall bias (for retrospective studies).\nReport standardized results when possible. To help readers interpret and use the results from cost estimate studies, it is helpful to report results in standardized dollars (e.g., 2012 dollars) and provide metrics that adjust for clinic size (e.g., cost per member or per patient per month, per clinician FTE, or per visit).\n#### Research Gaps and Future Directions\nThe Estimating Costs research team\u2019s experiences highlight some research gaps and suggest promising directions for future research. The suggestions below build on input provided by AHRQ Estimating Costs grantees.\nThe use of a variety of methods and metrics to report the costs of primary care transformation efforts makes meta-analysis difficult. It may therefore be important for the field to develop a consensus on standardized measurement strategies to measure costs on a larger scale. A useful industry model is the Medical Group Management Association\u2019s use of annual cost benchmarking surveys of primary care practices."

              "Program scale may impact outcomes through different mechanisms. On the one hand, increases in scale may lead to an adverse impact on implementation quality leading to lower effectiveness. A recent -analysis of development programs, including those that focus on microfinance, financial literacy and women\u2019s empowerment, concluded that larger programs and programs that were implemented by governments had lower effects (). Indeed, program-specific evidence on other development interventions suggests that many programs that are successful at a smaller scale fail to achieve similar positive effects after scaling up (, ). More recent evidence indicates that in communities could explain the larger positive effects of interventions implemented by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) relative to interventions implemented by governments ().\nOn the other hand, service scale may also alter the costs of service provision if programs are able to achieve (). Previous evidence from health programs and interventions aiming to reduce gender-based violence indeed show that the average costs of these programs reduce significantly when they reach a larger number of program participants (, , , ). At the same time, more complex interventions like multidimensional livelihoods and financial inclusion interventions, may achieve diseconomies of scale if the programs face input or labor supply constraints (). The scale-up of SHG programs and other development interventions could either increase or decrease their cost-effectiveness depending on how scale changes the implementation quality, effectiveness, and costs of programming. In the absence of cost information, and specifically cost information about programs delivered at different levels of scale, the of large-scale programs as well as the policy implications of the studies showing an adverse relationship between impact and scale remain unclear.",
              "Understanding how costs change with scale is challenging since the nature of program and the number of activities often change as programs expand. Studies have pointed out that a good way to differentiate between short-run and long-run costs is by exploiting time-series data on program costs \u2013 a challenging endeavor given the lack of data on costs over time (). While a large dataset with data on costs of multiple programs over many periods and program components would be ideal, such data is almost never readily available. Instead, most studies observe cost data at one point in time or have limited data on the costs of different program components precluding researchers from studying how costs vary with changes in both program scale and program scope. Therefore, even a small increase in the number of cost data points over time can significantly increase the evidence-base on how costs change with scale, especially when data include costs of different program components. Time-series data are particularly important for women\u2019s groups like SHGs, that usually start with the goal of increased financial access to women, but with time, often include additional layers like health or farm and non-farm-based livelihoods initiatives.",
              "We examine the costs of increasing both the scope as well as the scale of services related to expanding \u2019s outreach of the SHG program. To analyze program scale, we consider costs from expanding the geographic supply of the program by adding more participants over time across the state. To analyze program scope, we study component-specific costs of the program, differentiating between expenditures related to key program activities (community mobilization and financial inclusion), and expenditures related to overall operations and management. We also study the changes in total program costs in relationship to core program activities, including the federation of SHGs, such as the formation of SHGs, VOs, CLFs, and bank linkages.\nWe estimate average program costs as costs per SHG woman targeted under the program, treating each  member added as an additional program output. While not all women received the same level of services with the same intensity, we estimate an average cost equivalent to an \u201cIntent to Treat\u201d cost \u2013 that is, expenditure per woman with access to potential program services. From \u2019s expenditure components discussed earlier, we consider three expenditure components \u2013 Community Institution Development, Special Technical Assistance Fund, and Project Management. We do not include Community Investment Funds when studying the relationship of costs with scale because it is disbursed to SHGs or their federations as a one-time grant or capital based on need and is usually a fixed amount (of INR 66,000, on average, [])."

              "#  What are the major federal safety net programs in the U.S.? A summary of efforts to reduce poverty in the U.S.\nSome of these programs are entitlements. Everyone can expect to receive an Earned Income Tax Credit if they qualify. Other programs, like the nutrition assistance programs SNAP and WIC, only benefit those who claim them before the budgeted funds run out.\nHere is a timeline and summary of selected safety net programs in the U.S.\n### 1935: The Social Security Act\nPart of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal legislation, the original act included grants to states for unemployment compensation, aid to dependent children and public health. Today, Social Security is the largest safety net program in the U.S. In 2017 it will reach an estimated 62 million Americans with $955 billion in benefits.\nFor more information visit the \nUnemployment insurance was a part of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s 1935 Social Security Act. Today\u2019s U.S. Department of Labor Unemployment Insurance (UI) programs provide benefits to eligible workers who become unemployed through no fault of their own and who meet certain requirements.\nThe program is a unique federal-state partnership, based on Federal law, but administered by individual states. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that UI benefits totaled $32 2016 when the unemployment rate averaged 4.6 percent. \nFor more information about Unemployment Insurance, visit the \nThis pre-school education program was a part of the 1964 Economic Opportunity Act that was designed to reduce disparities among young children. The 1994 Head Start Act Amendments established the Early Head Start program, which expanded the benefits of early childhood development to low income families with children under three years old.",
              "In 2016 the program served up to 900,000 mostly low-income children per year with total federal spending of over $8.7 billion. While the program\u2019s effectiveness has been criticized by prominent researchers, show the benefits of Head Start, especially for children at the bottom of the skill distribution. \nFor more information on Head Start, visit the [Office of Head Start online](http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs/)\n### 1964: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\nThe first Food Stamp program ran from 1939-43, but the program we know today was established with the 1964 Food Stamp Act. The program is now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and served 44.2 million people with $66.5 billion in benefits in 2016.\nStudies co-authored by Research Affiliate Hilary Hoynes found that SNAP contributed to increases in birth weights, but also found that the benefit is associated with fewer hours worked.\nFor more information on the program, visit the [Food and Nutrition Service website for SNAP](http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/snapmain.htm)\nThese health programs were established with amendments to the Social Security Act in 1965. Today, Medicare provides health insurance for people over 65 years of age and some younger than that but who have certain disabilities or diseases. Medicaid is a Federal and state partnership that provides health coverage for people with low income.\nDuring 2015, enrollment in Medicare averaged about 55.3 million people who received $615.6 billion in benefits. In fiscal year 2015, total Medcaid spending was $552.3 billion, of which federal spending for Medicaid was $348 billion ($301 billion covered benefits for enrollees). States funded the additional $220 billion. Approximately 68.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 2015.\nFor more information about Medicare and Medicaid, visit the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services online](http://www.cms.gov/)",
              "For more information on Pell Grants, visiting the [U.S. Department of Education online](http://www2.ed.gov/programs/fpg/index.html)\n### 1975: The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)\nThe EITC is a tax credit that benefits working people who have low to moderate income, especially families. In 2015, the EITC reached 46.2 million tax filers at a total cost of $58.8 billion. Since EITC benefits are not considered income for other Federal benefit programs, they do not jeopardize recipients who qualify for other assistance like SNAP or Medicaid.\nResearch has shown that the impacts of the EITC are wider than raising families out of poverty. A by Center Research Affiliates Hilary Hoynes and Douglas Miller found that it also increased birth weights and reduced low birth-weight births.\nFor more information on the EITC, visit the \n### 1996: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\nTANF issues federal grants to states for programs that provide temporary benefits to families with children when the income does not provide for the family\u2019s basic needs. Programs include job preparation, family planning and other benefits as well as cash assistance.\nThe program replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC), which was established by the 1935 Social Security Act. In 1996 it was replaced by TANF as part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act welfare reform that would change the face of the safety net in the U.S. While AFDC allowed families to receive assistance for as long as they were eligible, TANF imposes a five-year limit on benefits.\nWhile the federal government funds a share of state TANF programs, it leaves it to states to determine the shape those programs take. In 2015, the total Federal cost for TANF was about $16 billion, with an additional $15.3 billion coming from states. That year, the program provided cash assistance to about 3 million people."

This program is administered by the of the , but benefits are distributed by the individual U.S. states. It is historically and commonly known as the Food Stamp Program, though all legal references to \"stamp\" and \"coupon\" have been replaced by \"EBT\" and \"card,\" referring to the refillable, plastic (EBT) cards that replaced the paper \"food stamp\" coupons. To be eligible for SNAP benefits, the recipients must have incomes below 130 percent of the poverty line, and also own few assets. Since the economic downturn began in 2008, the use of food stamps has increased. \nThe [Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIC_program \"WIC program\") (WIC) is a for healthcare and nutrition of low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and infants and children under the age of five.

              "Prior to the enactment of the ACA in 2010, Hispanic, Black, Asian, AIAN, and NHPI people under age 65 were more likely to be uninsured compared to their White counterparts, with Hispanic and AIAN people at the highest risk of lacking coverage (Figure 1). Their higher uninsured rates reflected more limited access to affordable health coverage options. Although the majority of individuals have at least one in the family across racial and ethnic groups, there are ongoing racial disparities in employment and income that result in some groups having more limited access to coverage offered by an employer or having greater difficulty affording private coverage when it is available. While Medicaid helped fill some of these gaps in private coverage, prior to the ACA, Medicaid eligibility for parents in most states was limited to those with very low incomes (often below 50% of the poverty level), and adults without dependent children\u2014regardless of how poor\u2014were .",
              "While there were minimal changes in overall uninsured rates between 2022 and 2023, Hispanic, Black, AIAN, and NHPI people under the age of 65 years old remained more likely than their White counterparts to be uninsured (Figure 2). AIAN and Hispanic people had the highest uninsured rates at 18.7% and 17.9%, respectively, as of 2023. Uninsured rates for NHPI (12.8%) and Black people (9.7%) also were higher than the rate for their White counterparts (6.5%). These differences in uninsured rates are driven by lower rates of private coverage among these groups. Medicaid coverage helps to narrow these differences but does not fully offset them.\nMedicaid and CHIP coverage help fill gaps in private coverage and reduce coverage disparities for children, but some disparities in children\u2019s coverage remain (Figure 2). Medicaid and CHIP cover larger shares of children than adults, reflecting more expansive eligibility levels for children. This coverage helps fill gaps in private coverage, with over half of Hispanic, Black, AIAN, and NHPI children covered by Medicaid and CHIP. However, there remain some disparities in children\u2019s coverage. For example, AIAN children are about three times as likely as their White counterparts to lack coverage (12.7% vs. 4.0%). Moreover, Hispanic children are more than twice as likely as White children to be uninsured (8.5% vs. 4.0%).",
              "under the age of 65, uninsured rates in states that have not expanded Medicaid are higher than rates in expansion states across most racial and ethnic groups as of 2023 (Figure 3). The differences in coverage rates between Black and Hispanic people compared with White people are larger in non-expansion states compared with expansion states. However, the relative risk of being uninsured for Black, Hispanic, and Asian people compared with White people is similar in expansion and non-expansion states. For example, Hispanic people under the age of 65 years old are roughly 2.6 times as likely as their White counterparts to lack coverage in both expansion and non-expansion states. Uninsured rates for AIAN people are similar in expansion and non-expansion states. Overall, the differences in coverage by expansion status are primarily driven by differences in coverage rates among adults ages 18-64. However, White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, and NHPI children in non-expansion states also are more likely to be uninsured than those in expansion states. For example, 13.5% of Hispanic children in non-expansion states are uninsured compared to 6.1% of Hispanic children in expansion states.\n## Eligibility for Coverage among the Uninsured as of 2023"

The majority of this group had private insurance (78.2, 95% CI: 76.6, 79.8%). On the other hand, 1022 (4.0%) subjects were classified into the minority-lowincome-bad health group, 54.5% of whom were covered by public insurance (95% CI: 50.6, 58.4%) (Table ). Across the eight groups, the low-income minorities with bad health had the highest uninsured percentage (15.8, 95% CI: 12.6, 19.0%), followed by low-income minorities with good health (15.3, 95% CI: 13.7, 16.8), whereas the white-highincome-good health group had the lowest uninsurance rate (3.7, 95% CI: 3.0, 4.3). \nTable 1 Vulnerability and health insurance coverage - 2017 US civilian noninstitutionalized population under 65 years old\nThere was a clear association between income level and health insurance coverage. Those with high income had much smaller uninsurance rate than those with low income: 3.7\u20138.6% vs. 9.8\u201315.8%, a difference of 6.1\u20137.2%.

Among the insured, those with high income were more likely to have private insurance (51.3\u201378.2% vs. 8.9\u201325.8%) whereas those with low income were more likely to have public insurance (39.0\u201354.5% vs. 4.9\u201317.4%) presumably due to the connection between low income and public insurance qualification.",
              "Our findings were consistent with previous studies. Buchmueller and Levy evaluated the ACA\u2019s impact on racial and ethnic disparities in health insurance coverage and access to care, and found a large number of adults remain uninsured, and the uninsurance rate among blacks and Hispanics was substantially higher than the rate among whites []. Another study assessed the insurance patterns and instability from 2006 to 2016, and found despite the post-ACA instability reduction, over 25% of the U.S. population continued to have insurance gaps over a two-year period; and found disparities continued to exist between income groups, race/ethnicities, and regions []. Compared with the above evidence, our results added further empirical evidence on the combined effect of race and income on health insurance coverage in the US, and the uniqueness of our study was looking at the influence of multiple vulnerability traits together rather than separately as other studies did.\nThese findings have significant policy implications. To expand insurance coverage and eliminate racial disparities as called for by Healthy People 2030, concerted and targeted efforts are needed to both improve economic status and address disparities towards racial/ethnic minorities. To maximize limited resources, policymakers should target insurance coverage for the most vulnerable subpopulations, i.e., those with a convergence of predisposing, enabling, and need attributes of risk. The findings placed quantitative content to the theoretical framework of the vulnerability mode. As shown in this study, these are individuals who have low income and are racial/ethnic minorities. Significant progress at reducing disparities in care and quality across racial and ethnic groups is unlikely to be fulfilled without significantly expanding insurance coverage for this most vulnerable group."

              "#  Who Goes Without Health Insurance? Who Is Most Likely to Be Uninsured?\nThis chapter provides a portrait of the uninsured, to support the Committee's future reports about the consequences of uninsurance. Here, the Committee reviews and summarizes the published literature about what socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic characteristics describe the uninsured both collectively and as members of groups in the general population that are more likely than average to be uninsured. Supporting methodological information and data tables provide the numbers behind the general statements in the text and can be found in Appendixes and . All estimates are for persons uninsured during calendar year 1999 (the most recent available Current Population Survey data), unless otherwise indicated.\nThe large number and variety of Americans who are uninsured underscore the Committee's conclusion that the voluntary, employment-based approach to insurance coverage in the United States functions less like a system and more like a sieve. There are many ways to slip through the holes. People of all ages, levels of education, and in all states may be uninsured, although socioeconomic and geographic factors that affect coverage are highly correlated. One's chances of being uninsured increase if one works in an occupation or in an employment sector where employers are less likely to offer a health benefit, if one is self-employed or works for a small private-sector firm, or if one has too low an income to afford coverage.\nThe final section of this chapter includes estimates of the relative importance of key social, economic, demographic, and geographic characteristics to one's likelihood of being uninsured, based on a new multivariate analysis of published data. Most of the studies that the Committee reviewed are based on two-way (bivariate) analyses of a characteristic and the probability that an individual with that characteristic will be uninsured.",
              "Throughout the chapter, the Committee addresses two questions together:     \nWhat are the characteristics of the uninsured population?     \nWho is most likely to be uninsured?\nThe distribution of socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic differences in the general population under age 65 affects how these characteristics are distributed among the uninsured population because the relative size of specific population groups affects their representation among the uninsured. For example, the uninsured for the urban population is the same as that of the rural population, although four out of five uninsured people live in urban areas, reflecting the predominance of urban populations nationally.\n## HOW SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECT COVERAGE\nFull-time, full-year employment offers families the best chances of acquiring and keeping health insurance, as does an annual income of at least a moderate level (greater than 200 percent of the federal poverty level []). Insured status correlates highly with many aspects of employment, including work status, income level, educational attainment, occupation, and employer characteristics such as firm size and employment sector.\nEight out of every ten uninsured people are members of families with at least one wage earner, and six out of every ten uninsured people are wage earners themselves. Nonetheless, members of families without wage earners are much more likely to be uninsured than members of families with wage earners.",
              "Lower-income parents face income and other eligibility criteria that may prevent them from qualifying for , although their children may be covered. This may result in a family being partially insured. Since welfare reform in 1996, lower-income parents have been losing insurance coverage, with the de cline in public coverage greater than the increase in employment-based coverage. The impact falls disproportionately on lower-income mothers (Guyer and Mann, 1999; Garrett and Holahan, 2000; Klein, 2000; Guyer et al., 2001). Only 33 percent of women who move from public assistance to employment obtain coverage through their employer (Garrett and Holahan, 2000). Among low-income people (less than 100 percent of ), working parents are twice as likely to be uninsured as nonworking parents because nonworking, single parents often have very young children and are more likely to have Medicaid coverage (Guyer and Mann, 1999).\n## OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN COVERAGE\nThe nature and type of labor force participation determine whether individuals and family members obtain employment-based coverage. Foreign-born persons and members of ethnic and racial minority groups are more likely than average to be uninsured, although their smaller numbers in the general population mean that uninsured rates overall are dominated by the rates for U.S.-born citizens and non-Hispanic whites.\nMost uninsured people are U.S. citizens by birth (native-born residents comprise about 90 percent of the general population). The relatively small proportion of the general population comprised of naturalized citizens and noncitizens (immigrants) is significantly more likely than U.S.-born residents to be uninsured, although immigrants' uninsured rates decline with increasing length of residency in the United States."

Taking a close look at the data could illuminate ways to help expand health coverage to people who remain uninsured, from dismantling barriers to eligibility and enrollment to improving the scope and accessibility of outreach and enrollment assistance. The overall uninsured rate reached record lows in 2022, but to achieve further coverage gains and to reach racial equity in health coverage, it is essential to sustain and expand upon successful, more targeted policies.",

While it is true that health coverage rates vary across racial and ethnic groups, limiting analysis to broad racial categories \u2014 as is often the practice \u2014 can conceal the diverse experiences of communities within them. Disaggregating race and ethnicity into smaller groups could improve response rates on race/ethnicity questions, shed further light on health inequities, and uncover community needs.\nReasons that data are often not disaggregated into racial and ethnic subgroups can include sample sizes that are too small for precise estimation, concerns over privacy and surveillance, and the risk that users of the data will misattribute differences between groups and not account for the context of inequities such as racism, discrimination, and other structural barriers to opportunity. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which sets national race and ethnicity reporting standards, cites a lack of consensus in terminology as an additional barrier to adding racial and ethnic categories to the minimum federal reporting requirements."

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites. \nThe Office of Child Care (OCC) administers the Child Care and Development Fund program (CCDF), which is the primary federal funding source to help families with low incomes access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children. Access to affordable high-quality child care has numerous short- and long-term benefits for children, families, and society, supporting child and family well-being in a manner that fuels prosperity and strengthens communities and the economy. Child care is a necessity for most families with young children and reliable access leads to better parental earnings and employment and supports parents' educational attainment.\nCCDF is the primary federal funding source for child care subsidies to help eligible low-income working families access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children.\nThe passage of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of 2014 reauthorized the law governing CCDF. The law defines health and safety requirements for child care providers, outlines family-friendly eligibility policies, expands quality improvement efforts, and ensures that parents and the public have transparent information about the child care choices available to them. Under the law, States continue to have flexibility within federal guidelines over key policy levers\u2014including subsidy payment rates, co-payment amounts contributed by the family, income thresholds for determining eligibility, and quality improvement investments.\n### Child Care Services Funded by CCDF",
              "Subsidized child care services are available to eligible families through certificates (vouchers), or grants and contracts with providers. Under the law, States must establish eligibility policies, including a period of at least 12 months before eligibility is re-determined, that promote continuity of care for children and families. The program provides parents with the choice of a range of provider settings and types\u2014including centers, family child care homes, relatives, and faith-based providers. Parents may select a participating child care provider that satisfies applicable state and local requirements, including health and safety requirements. Under the law, States must: ensure that these health and safety requirements address key areas (such as first aid and CPR); require that providers receive training in these areas; complete comprehensive criminal background checks; and conduct monitoring that includes annual inspections. Approximately 1.3 million children receive a child care subsidy from the CCDF program every month.\nA portion of CCDF funds must be used to improve the quality of child care and other additional services to parents, such as resource and referral counseling regarding the selection of child care providers. The 2014 law increases the minimum amount that States are required to spend for quality activities, and includes new funding for improving the quality of care for infants and toddlers. To improve the health and safety of available child care, CCDF lead agencies provide training, grants and loans to providers; improved monitoring; compensation projects; and other innovative programs. Many lead agencies are making systemic investments, such as developing quality rating and improvement systems and professional development systems. Tribes may use a portion of their funds to construct child care facilities provided there is no reduction in the current level of child care services.",
              "The CCDF allows states to serve families through a single, integrated child care subsidy program under the rules of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. States coordinate CCDF with Head Start, pre-k, and other early childhood programs. States can also transfer a portion of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families dollars to CCDF, or spend TANF directly for child care.\n### State and Tribal Child Care Plans\nAll states, territories and tribes must submit comprehensive plans every three years and conduct public hearings to invite public comment.\nA portion of CCDF is used for child care research, demonstration and evaluation activities. These funds are increasing the capacity for child care research at the national, state and local levels while addressing critical questions with implications for children and families. Funds have been awarded to support individual project areas, including policy research, research partnerships, research scholars and a web-based archive called Child Care and Early Education Research Connections.\nA small portion of the CCDF is used by the Office of Child Care to provide technical assistance to grantees. Its technical assistance network is designed to address the needs of states, territories and tribes administering CCDF.\nCCDF is authorized under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act (CCDBG) which was enacted under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The CCDBG Act was amended and reauthorized by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, and again by the CCDBG Act of 2014. CCDF made $9.5 billion available to states, territories, and tribes in fiscal year 2021. In addition, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriation Act (or CRRSA Act) provided $10 billion in supplemental CCDF monies to address the impacts of the coronavirus."

              "More from Bipartisan Policy Center\n\nThe Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the largest source for child care. CCDF funds are distributed to states, tribes, and territories to help them administer child care assistance programs for low-income working families. As conversations around federal and child care access dominate news cycles, understanding how child care is funded is key.\nCCDF was created in 1996 to help low-income workers child care. The fund is comprised of two financing mechanisms: the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) and Child Care Entitlement to States (CCES). CCDF combines CCDBG discretionary funds and CCES mandatory and matching funds into block grants for states, tribes, and territories to subsidize the cost of child care\u2014streamlining a one stop shop for administering and governing funding. It is housed in the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Child Care.\nCCDF allows states to provide eligible families with a subsidy to help pay for a licensed child care program for their child, so that they can work, attend job training, or enroll in an educational program. States are required to have one department, a \u201cLead Agency,\u201d responsible for creating and managing CCDF funds.\nLead Agencies must follow broad federal guidelines for eligibility but they have a significant amount of autonomy to restrict their own state regulations. CCDF federal guidelines require the child families are seeking assistance for to meet the following requirements:\n  * Be under 13 years of age;\n  * Live with one or more parents who are working or enrolled in a job training or education program;\n  * Live in a family whose income does not exceed 85% of the State Median Income (SMI); and\n  * Live in a family whose assets do not exceed $1 million.",
              "Lead Agencies often shrink eligibility for child care subsidies through stricter requirements on family income and work provisions. Based on the 2025-2027 state plans, submitted to ACF every three years to show compliance with CCDF regulations, 31 states restrict their family income requirement to lower than 85% of SMI. Stricter requirements are often necessary due to high demand for child care assistance and funding constraints.\nCCDF also directs Lead Agencies to implement health and safety regulations, child care workforce development systems, quality improvement activities, and other actions that promote the accessibility of child care for all. HHS last updated CCDF regulations in .\n## Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG)\nThe Child Care and Development Block Grant, perhaps the most well-known aspect of CCDF, is only one part of the federal money allocated through CCDF. CCDBG funds and regulates child care services across all 50 states with discretionary funding passed by Congress through annual appropriations bills.\nCCDBG discretionary funds are administered through CCDF to each state based on the following funding allocation formula:\n  * The number of children under age five living in the state;\n  * The number of children living in the state who qualify for the National School Lunch Program; and\n  * The state per capita income.",
              "The allocation of matching funds per state is determined by the number of children under age 13 living in the state. The Lead Agency must \u201cmatch\u201d those funds with their own funding, this time using their Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate.\nOccasionally, CCDF administers more than just CCDBG and CCES funding. States can transfer up to 30% of their [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BPC_ECI-TANF-FY21-Report_RV22023.pdf) block grant funds directly to CCDF\u2014but not all states do. In FY 2023, states transferred a total of $1 billion from TANF to CCDF, allowing for their child care assistance programs to serve more low-income, working families.\nOriginally created to support low-income working parents, CCDF\u2019s role has grown, becoming an integral program supporting accessibility, stability, and quality within the wider child care landscape. Understanding the fiscal intricacies of CCDF is crucial for creating future policy recommendations and the role the federal government plays in supporting child care access for all families.\nYour source for bipartisan policy updates and insights."

              "# The Child Tax Credit: How It Works and Who Receives It\n## CRS PRODUCT (LIBRARY OF CONGRESS)\nBudget, Public Finance & Taxation; Social Welfare  \n\nThe Child Tax Credit: How It Works and Who Receives It\nUpdated November 13, 2025 (R41873) [Jump to Main Text of Report](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R41873#Content)\n\nThis report provides an overview of the child tax credit under current law, including a review of changes made by (also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJA) and (the FY2025 reconciliation law). \nThe child tax credit allows eligible taxpayers to reduce their federal income tax liability by up to $2,200 per qualifying child (indexed to inflation). If their tax liability is less than the value of their child tax credit, they may be eligible for a refundable credit calculated using the earned income formula. Under this formula, a family is eligible for a refund equal to 15% of their earnings in excess of $2,500, up to $1,700 per child, the maximum amount of the refundable portion of the credit. The credit phases out for unmarried parents with income over $200,000 and married couples with income over $400,000. The amount of the credit by income for a taxpayer with one qualifying child is illustrated below.",
              "## Child Tax Credit Amount by Income Level\nInternal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 24.  \nThe child tax credit was created in 1997 by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 () to help ease the financial burden that families incur when they have children. Like other tax credits, the child tax credit reduces tax liability dollar-for-dollar of the value of the credit. Initially the child tax credit was a nonrefundable credit for most families. A nonrefundable tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer's income tax liability to zero. In contrast, a refundable tax credit can exceed a taxpayer's income tax liability, providing a cash payment to low- and some moderate-income taxpayers who owe little or no income tax. \nThe child tax credit has undergone significant changes over time. At the end of 2017, Congress expanded the credit through 2025 as part of the TCJA (). The TCJA temporarily doubled the maximum credit amount and more than tripled the income level at which the credit begins to phase out. It also made changes to the refundable portion of the credit, including increasing the refundable credit amount from $1,000 to $1,400 per child (adjusted annually for inflation; $1,700 in 2025) and lowering the refundability threshold from $3,000 to $2,500. Although these changes were scheduled to expire at the end of 2025, the FY2025 reconciliation law () made them permanent. That law also permanently increased the maximum child tax credit from $2,000 per child to $2,200 per child, while indexing it to inflation. \nData from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) indicate that the total dollar amount of the child tax credit has increased significantly since enactment from approximately $23 billion in 1998 to $118 billion in 2022, with the largest increase coming after the TCJA expansions and the one-year expansion of the credit in the American Rescue Plan Act () in 2021, as illustrated below.",
              "## Taxpayers with Children, by Income Level in\n% of All Taxpayers With Children |  % of Taxpayers who Receive the Child Credit |  Child Tax Credit as % of After-Tax Income |  Average Child Credit per Taxpayer  \n---|---|---|---  \nThe child tax credit was created in 1997 by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 () to help ease the financial burden that families incur when they have children. Like other tax credits, the child tax credit reduces tax liability dollar for dollar of the value of the credit. Initially the child tax credit was a nonrefundable credit for most families. A nonrefundable tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer's income tax liability to zero, while a refundable tax credit can exceed a taxpayer's income tax liability, providing a cash payment primarily to low-income taxpayers who owe little or no income tax. \nOver the past 20 years, legislative changes have significantly changed the credit, transforming it from a generally nonrefundable credit available only to the middle and upper-middle class, to a refundable credit that more low-income families are eligible to claim. Most recently, at the end of 2017, Congress expanded the credit as part of , often referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJA. The law significantly expanded eligibility for and the amount of the credit for many higher-income taxpayers, with a more modest expansion for lower-income taxpayers. This change generally offsets the suspension of personal exemptions for those with dependents. made these changes permanent, and also increased the maximum credit from 2025 onward.\nThis report provides an overview of the credit under current law and also provides some summary data on these benefits.

              "The recent , the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) passed by Congress and signed by President Trump in July, extended and expanded provisions of the [2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/tax/) (TCJA) that otherwise would have expired at the end of 2025, and included additional relief and support for American families. to the (CTC) drew interest from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle prior to the final package emerged as one of the primary levers to increase support for . Now that the reconciliation package has become law, it is important to understand how the CTC changed, how it stacks up against previous expansions, and how the new law will impact families.\nThe new law made the base credit permanent and increased it to $2,200 per child effective in 2025 (and adjusted for inflation in years after). It also made permanent the phase-out threshold rate of $200,000 ($400,000 for taxpayers married filing jointly) and the $500 nonrefundable credit for non-child dependents. The bill also continues to adjust the refundable part of the credit for inflation each year (in 2025, the maximum refundable credit is $1,700 per child).\nThe bill adjusted the eligibility requirements to now require valid Social Security numbers (SSNs) for both the qualifying child the taxpayer claiming the child (previously, the law only required an SSN for the child). In the case of a joint return, only one parent needs to have an SSN to be eligible to claim the CTC. highlights the changes to the CTC in OBBB, and the proposed version in the House reconciliation bill compared to prior laws.\n### _Table 1: Enhanced CTC Comparisons to Prior Proposals and Law_\n## Proposed Ways and Means Bill (2025)\n$2,200 per child in 2025 (inflation-adjusted annually, starting 2026) | $2,500 per child (temporary); reverts to $2,000 (inflation-adjusted) after 2028",
              "The changes to the CTC will impact families differently, depending on their income levels and eligibility status. For example, the reconciliation package\u2019s more stringent SSN requirements mentioned above will have an impact on the number of people eligible for the credit moving forward. The Tax Policy Center estimated that 500,000 children who would otherwise be considered eligible to the credit if no parent can produce an SSN to comply with the new requirement.\nThe CTC provisions will only partially aid low-income families, despite the increased credit amount, since the CTC\u2019s income parameters remain unchanged. And as the CTC is not fully refundable and many low-income families owe little to nothing in federal income taxes, some families do not benefit from the increases to the base amount of the credit.\nAn estimated [23.8 million children will benefit](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/house-and-senate-plans-boost-child-tax-credit-could-help-more-low-income-families) from the larger CTC; however, those from households with lower incomes will see a smaller impact. shows the credit schedule in 2025 for a single parent with one child. Under the new law, families with a lower adjusted gross income (AGI) between $0 and $26,000 receive the same credit as they would under TCJA in 2025. At an AGI between $27,000 and $243,000, families benefit more from the $200 boost than they did from the TCJA credit, before it phases out.\n### _Figure 2: CTC Schedule for a Single Parent of One Child Under TCJA and OBBB_"

              "* Read the latest Daily Deductions \n_This post has been corrected: The number of children in families that cannot receive the full CTC because their parents do not earn enough is 19 million, not 30 million._\nThe (CTC)\u2014the largest tax benefit supporting families with children\u2014 has swung through big changes in recent years. Generally, the pattern of expansion has been for the credit to be increased to a fixed level and then stagnate, which leads to rising costs eroding the value of the credit. \nThe 2025 reconciliation act, or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), differed from these recent expansion efforts. It permanently increased the maximum credit amount to $2,200 per child and indexed it for inflation. \nA permanent, bigger CTC is good news for many. OBBBA made the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u2019s (TCJA\u2019s) expansion of the CTC permanent, preventing the CTC from dropping from $2,000 to $1,000 per child ([alongside other related changes to family tax provisions](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tcja-didnt-change-child-benefits-most-families-children-very-much)). And, more than that, the OBBBA increased the maximum credit to $2,200, which will now grow with inflation after 2025 (Figure 1). These changes [help middle- and high-income families](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/children-deserve-more-shutdown-threats-and-continuing-resolutions) offset the taxes they owe.\nThese changes do little for families with low incomes, because the credit's pre-OBBBA phase-in rules remain in place. And, as under prior law, that amount grows each year with inflation. But the amount of credit a family can receive beyond taxes owed is limited to 15 percent of earnings above $2,500. A larger credit with these same phase-in rules means that more children now live in families that cannot receive the full CTC because their parents do not earn enough. TPC estimates that number jumped from about to under the new law,about 30 percent of all children.",
              "And there\u2019s more bad news. Average benefits will decline slightly under the new law for the lowest-income families with children\u2014largely because about additional children with Social Security numbers (SSNs) who cannot be claimed by will now be ineligible (Figure 2). Rather than qualifying for the CTC, they can get\u2014at most\u2014a $500 credit that can only be used to offset taxes owed. Average benefits for middle-income and higher-income families with children will increase by about $200.\nA basic principle of the CTC is that all else equal, larger families receive larger benefits. This is true for most higher-income families, but not low-income families. Because of the credit\u2019s , 1.1 million children in low-income families with multiple children will get the same credit as if their families had only 1 child under age 17. This could be changed by phasing the credit in faster for larger families who have modest earnings.\nIn all, the changes to the CTC were a mixed bag for families with children. A larger, permanent, inflation-indexed credit helps many families plan with greater certainty. But, despite research suggesting that investments in children with low incomes more than many other social policies, millions of children in low-income families remain excluded, along with the economic returns that come from investing in them.\nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)\nChild tax credit (CTC)/Child and dependent care tax credit (CDCTC)\nSubscribe to our newsletters today."

              "The Tax Policy Center estimates that slightly less than 90 percent of families with children received an average CTC of $2,520 in 2025. The average credit exceeds the maximum per child credit because families can have more than one child. Families with children in all income groups benefited from the CTC, but families in the lowest income quintile were least likely to benefit because fewer of them have sufficient earnings to qualify for the credit. Just under three-quarters of families in the lowest income quintile were eligible for a CTC, receiving an average credit of $1,610. The average credit was the smallest for this quintile because low-income families are most likely to be limited to the refundable portion of the credit, which was capped at $1,700 in 2025 rather than the full $2,200 limit for the nonrefundable credit (figure 2).\nThe percentage of families with children receiving the credit and the average credit received were the highest among moderate- and middle-income families. The share of families with children claiming a CTC was 93 percent in the second income quintile, 98 percent in third quintile, and 99 percent in the fourth quintile. The proportion of families with children receiving a credit then drops to 78 percent in the highest income quintile because the credit phases out at high incomes (figure 3).\nThe CTC improves the well-being of low-income families with children. The Census Bureau estimates that along with the EITC, the refundable portion of the CTC\u2014the ACTC\u2014lifted 6.4 million people out of poverty in 2023, including 2 million children. Researchers at Columbia estimated that in 2023, the CTC reduced child poverty by 17.1 percent (from a child poverty rate of 16.5 percent without any CTC to 13.7 percent).\n#### Recent History of the CTC",
              "For low-income families, the refundable portion of the credit has also expanded over this time period. Before 2001, the CTC was generally nonrefundable. EGTRRA made part of the credit refundable based on earnings beginning in 2001 with the refundable portion (i.e., the ACTC) available to low-income families with earnings over $10,000 (this amount was indexed for inflation). As a result of changes made in response to the Great Recession, this threshold was temporarily reduced to $8,500 for 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) further reduced this threshold to $3,000 for 2009 and 2010. Along with the Bush-era tax cut changes discussed above, the $3,000 threshold was also extended temporarily after 2010 and ultimately made permanent by Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act.\nThe refundable portion of the CTC under EGTRRA was originally designed in 2001 to coordinate with the earned income tax credit (EITC). Once earnings reached $10,020 for families with two children in 2001, there was no further increase in the EITC. The earnings threshold for the refundable CTC was set at $10,000 so families could now receive a subsidy for earnings in excess of that amount. Like the earning threshold amounts for the EITC, the $10,000 earnings threshold was indexed for inflation. When the earnings threshold for the refundable CTC was reduced\u2014first to $8,500 in 2008 and then to $3,000 beginning in 2009\u2014that link between the phase-in of the refundable CTC and the EITC was broken.\nBoddupalli, Aravind and Luisa Godinez-Puig. 2025. \u201c[\u2019One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019 Child Tax Credit](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/one-big-beautiful-bill-child-tax-credit-would-exclude-millions-american-children)[Would Exclude Millions of American Children.](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/one-big-beautiful-bill-child-tax-credit-would-exclude-millions-american-children)\u201d Washington, DC: Urban-Brookings Tax PolicyCenter.",

Program-level bullets\n   - For each federal program described in node_3 (SNAP, Medicaid, TANF, WIC, child nutrition programs, housing assistance, federal tax credits such as EITC/CTC, and any other programs listed in node_3), create one bullet that:\n     a. Names the program.\n     b. Summarizes scope/target population, key eligibility rules, typical benefit level(s), and major administrative features (e.g., federal/state roles, waivers, recertification, asset tests) \u2014 all drawn from node_3. Immediately append \"(node_3)\".\n     c. Immediately follow with a brief sentence (1\u20132 lines) summarizing the specific measurable gaps or barriers that affect that program\u2019s coverage/adequacy/take-up, using the findings from node_4. Append \"(gaps: node_4)\". If node_4 supplies numeric measures of unmet need for that program, include those figures in this sentence and cite \"(node_4)\".\n\n   - Example structure for each program bullet:\n     \"Program X \u2014 one-line summary of scope, eligibility, benefits, admin features. (node_3) Related unmet needs: [who is uncovered / benefit adequacy / administrative barriers / take-up rate], [quantitative measure if available]. (gaps: node_4)\"\n\n2. Cross-cutting synthesis bullets\n   - After the program-level bullets, include several bullets that synthesize cross-cutting themes that span multiple programs. Use node_3 for factual descriptions of program design features and node_4 for evidence on gaps and barriers. Each bullet must cite both nodes appropriately, e.g., \"(node_3, node_4)\".\n   - Important cross-cutting topics to cover (each as a separate bullet):\n     a. Coverage gaps and excluded/underserved groups (e.g., noncitizens, working poor above eligibility thresholds, homeless or precariously housed households) \u2014 cite node_4 for which groups are uncovered and node_3 if design features explain exclusion.\n     b. Benefit adequacy (how benefits compare to poverty/need thresholds; common shortfalls) \u2014 cite node_4 for measures of adequacy and node_3 for benefit design.\n     c. Administrative and nonfinancial barriers (complex applications, documentation, churn, recertification, stigma, access in rural/remote areas) \u2014 cite node_4 for evidence and node_3 for the administrative features that create these barriers.\n     d. Program fragmentation and interaction problems (cliffs, lack of coordination, inconsistent state implementation, Medicaid expansion differences) \u2014 cite node_3 for structural details and node_4 for impacts.\n     e. Data and measurement limitations noted in node_4 (gaps in evidence, where better data are needed) \u2014 cite node_4.\n\n3. Prioritization and measurable unmet needs\n   - Conclude with 2\u20133 short bullets that prioritize the most critical unmet needs (highest population affected or largest shortfall in benefits) and list concrete, measurable indicators that would show improvement (e.g., % of eligible population reached, take-up rate, poverty gap reduction, median replacement rate). Use node_4 for ranking/prioritization and any numeric evidence; reference node_3 where needed for baseline program parameters. Mark these bullets \"(node_4)\" or \"(node_3, node_4)\" as appropriate.\n\n4. Provenance and transparency\n   - Every bullet must explicitly include the relevant child id(s) at the end of the bullet or clause, so downstream users can trace statements back to node_3 and/or node_4.\n   - If a program in node_3 has no corresponding gap information in node_4, still include the program-level bullet and note \"(no specific gaps reported in node_4)\" with the node_3 citation.\n   - If node_4 identifies gaps or groups but node_3 lacks program detail needed to explain them, note that the gap is reported in node_4 and flag that further program detail is missing from node_3 (e.g., \"program design detail not in node_3\"). Cite node_4 and note the missing provenance.\n\n5. Style and length constraints\n   - Keep each bullet concise (one to three sentences).\n   - Limit the total number of bullets to a focused, readable list (suggested 10\u201315 bullets total): one per major program (approx. 6\u20139), 3\u20134 cross-cutting bullets, and 2\u20133 prioritization/metrics bullets.\n   - Avoid heavy formatting; plain bullets only. But ensure clarity by keeping program names bolded or capitalized in the text (if formatting not available, capitalize program names).\n\n6. Traceable mapping appendix (optional short bullet)\n   - Add a final single-line bullet that lists which child nodes contributed to which sections, e.g., \"Source mapping: program descriptions -> node_3; gaps/metrics/priorities -> node_4.\" Include child ids \"(node_3, node_4)\".\n\nUsing these instructions, produce the parent list for node_2 that (a) summarizes the current federal social services landscape program-by-program (from node_3), (b) ties measurable gaps and barriers to the relevant programs and populations (from node_4), and (c) ends with a short prioritized set of unmet needs with measurable indicators \u2014 all bullets annotated with the child ids for provenance.",

(node_3, node_4)\n\n- Administrative and nonfinancial barriers \u2014 State discretion, complex paperwork, recertification/churn, SSN/documentation requirements, and employment patterns (self\u2011employment, small\u2011firm work) reduce effective access across programs (CCDF, Head Start, CTC/EITC and health programs); node_4 identifies these administrative factors as major drivers of non\u2011take\u2011up. (node_3, node_4)\n\n- Program fragmentation and interaction problems \u2014 Different program scopes (CCDF supports parental work; Head Start focuses on early education), inconsistent state implementation, and policy choices (e.g., Medicaid expansion variation) create cliffs, coordination gaps and missed complementarities between cash (CTC/EITC) and care supports that blunt both employment and child\u2011outcome gains. (node_3, node_4)\n\n- Data and measurement limitations \u2014 Node_4 highlights inadequate disaggregation of race/ethnicity and limited overlap data (e.g., overlap of CTC recipients with CCDF/Head Start use), hindering targeting and evaluation; program descriptions in node_3 do not supply the granular administrative overlap data needed to close these evidence gaps. (node_3, node_4)\n\n- Priority unmet need \u2014 Expand child\u2011care subsidy scale and move toward entitlement\u2011like access: CCDF presently serves ~1.8M children vs ~11.5M baseline\u2011eligible (\u22489.7M unserved), so increasing funding/entitlement rules and reducing state rationing would measurably raise access (indicator: % of baseline\u2011eligible children receiving subsidies; current baseline from node_3). (node_3, node_4)\n\n- Priority unmet need \u2014 Make family tax supports reachable for the poorest children: because the ACTC phases in with earnings and \u224830% of children live in families that cannot receive the full CTC, making the CTC fully refundable or creating a non\u2011earnings supplement would expand coverage (indicators: % of children receiving full CTC; child poverty rate reduction). (node_3, node_4)\n\n- Priority unmet need \u2014 Reduce administrative/documentation barriers and improve coordination: simplify SSN/documentation rules, align enrollment/outreach across tax, CCDF and Head Start, and track cross\u2011program take\u2011up (indicators: reduction in share of eligible families citing paperwork/ID as barriers; increased cross\u2011program enrollment rates).

              "#  What are the major federal safety net programs in the U.S.? A summary of efforts to reduce poverty in the U.S.\nSome of these programs are entitlements. Everyone can expect to receive an Earned Income Tax Credit if they qualify. Other programs, like the nutrition assistance programs SNAP and WIC, only benefit those who claim them before the budgeted funds run out.\nHere is a timeline and summary of selected safety net programs in the U.S.\n### 1935: The Social Security Act\nPart of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal legislation, the original act included grants to states for unemployment compensation, aid to dependent children and public health. Today, Social Security is the largest safety net program in the U.S. In 2017 it will reach an estimated 62 million Americans with $955 billion in benefits.\nFor more information visit the \nUnemployment insurance was a part of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s 1935 Social Security Act. Today\u2019s U.S. Department of Labor Unemployment Insurance (UI) programs provide benefits to eligible workers who become unemployed through no fault of their own and who meet certain requirements.\nThe program is a unique federal-state partnership, based on Federal law, but administered by individual states. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that UI benefits totaled $32 2016 when the unemployment rate averaged 4.6 percent. \nFor more information about Unemployment Insurance, visit the \nThis pre-school education program was a part of the 1964 Economic Opportunity Act that was designed to reduce disparities among young children. The 1994 Head Start Act Amendments established the Early Head Start program, which expanded the benefits of early childhood development to low income families with children under three years old.",
              "In 2016 the program served up to 900,000 mostly low-income children per year with total federal spending of over $8.7 billion. While the program\u2019s effectiveness has been criticized by prominent researchers, show the benefits of Head Start, especially for children at the bottom of the skill distribution. \nFor more information on Head Start, visit the [Office of Head Start online](http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ohs/)\n### 1964: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\nThe first Food Stamp program ran from 1939-43, but the program we know today was established with the 1964 Food Stamp Act. The program is now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and served 44.2 million people with $66.5 billion in benefits in 2016.\nStudies co-authored by Research Affiliate Hilary Hoynes found that SNAP contributed to increases in birth weights, but also found that the benefit is associated with fewer hours worked.\nFor more information on the program, visit the [Food and Nutrition Service website for SNAP](http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/snapmain.htm)\nThese health programs were established with amendments to the Social Security Act in 1965. Today, Medicare provides health insurance for people over 65 years of age and some younger than that but who have certain disabilities or diseases. Medicaid is a Federal and state partnership that provides health coverage for people with low income.\nDuring 2015, enrollment in Medicare averaged about 55.3 million people who received $615.6 billion in benefits. In fiscal year 2015, total Medcaid spending was $552.3 billion, of which federal spending for Medicaid was $348 billion ($301 billion covered benefits for enrollees). States funded the additional $220 billion. Approximately 68.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in 2015.\nFor more information about Medicare and Medicaid, visit the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services online](http://www.cms.gov/)",
              "For more information on Pell Grants, visiting the [U.S. Department of Education online](http://www2.ed.gov/programs/fpg/index.html)\n### 1975: The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)\nThe EITC is a tax credit that benefits working people who have low to moderate income, especially families. In 2015, the EITC reached 46.2 million tax filers at a total cost of $58.8 billion. Since EITC benefits are not considered income for other Federal benefit programs, they do not jeopardize recipients who qualify for other assistance like SNAP or Medicaid.\nResearch has shown that the impacts of the EITC are wider than raising families out of poverty. A by Center Research Affiliates Hilary Hoynes and Douglas Miller found that it also increased birth weights and reduced low birth-weight births.\nFor more information on the EITC, visit the \n### 1996: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\nTANF issues federal grants to states for programs that provide temporary benefits to families with children when the income does not provide for the family\u2019s basic needs. Programs include job preparation, family planning and other benefits as well as cash assistance.\nThe program replaced the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC), which was established by the 1935 Social Security Act. In 1996 it was replaced by TANF as part of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act welfare reform that would change the face of the safety net in the U.S. While AFDC allowed families to receive assistance for as long as they were eligible, TANF imposes a five-year limit on benefits.\nWhile the federal government funds a share of state TANF programs, it leaves it to states to determine the shape those programs take. In 2015, the total Federal cost for TANF was about $16 billion, with an additional $15.3 billion coming from states. That year, the program provided cash assistance to about 3 million people."

              "Prior to the enactment of the ACA in 2010, Hispanic, Black, Asian, AIAN, and NHPI people under age 65 were more likely to be uninsured compared to their White counterparts, with Hispanic and AIAN people at the highest risk of lacking coverage (Figure 1). Their higher uninsured rates reflected more limited access to affordable health coverage options. Although the majority of individuals have at least one in the family across racial and ethnic groups, there are ongoing racial disparities in employment and income that result in some groups having more limited access to coverage offered by an employer or having greater difficulty affording private coverage when it is available. While Medicaid helped fill some of these gaps in private coverage, prior to the ACA, Medicaid eligibility for parents in most states was limited to those with very low incomes (often below 50% of the poverty level), and adults without dependent children\u2014regardless of how poor\u2014were .",
              "While there were minimal changes in overall uninsured rates between 2022 and 2023, Hispanic, Black, AIAN, and NHPI people under the age of 65 years old remained more likely than their White counterparts to be uninsured (Figure 2). AIAN and Hispanic people had the highest uninsured rates at 18.7% and 17.9%, respectively, as of 2023. Uninsured rates for NHPI (12.8%) and Black people (9.7%) also were higher than the rate for their White counterparts (6.5%). These differences in uninsured rates are driven by lower rates of private coverage among these groups. Medicaid coverage helps to narrow these differences but does not fully offset them.\nMedicaid and CHIP coverage help fill gaps in private coverage and reduce coverage disparities for children, but some disparities in children\u2019s coverage remain (Figure 2). Medicaid and CHIP cover larger shares of children than adults, reflecting more expansive eligibility levels for children. This coverage helps fill gaps in private coverage, with over half of Hispanic, Black, AIAN, and NHPI children covered by Medicaid and CHIP. However, there remain some disparities in children\u2019s coverage. For example, AIAN children are about three times as likely as their White counterparts to lack coverage (12.7% vs. 4.0%). Moreover, Hispanic children are more than twice as likely as White children to be uninsured (8.5% vs. 4.0%).",
              "under the age of 65, uninsured rates in states that have not expanded Medicaid are higher than rates in expansion states across most racial and ethnic groups as of 2023 (Figure 3). The differences in coverage rates between Black and Hispanic people compared with White people are larger in non-expansion states compared with expansion states. However, the relative risk of being uninsured for Black, Hispanic, and Asian people compared with White people is similar in expansion and non-expansion states. For example, Hispanic people under the age of 65 years old are roughly 2.6 times as likely as their White counterparts to lack coverage in both expansion and non-expansion states. Uninsured rates for AIAN people are similar in expansion and non-expansion states. Overall, the differences in coverage by expansion status are primarily driven by differences in coverage rates among adults ages 18-64. However, White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, and NHPI children in non-expansion states also are more likely to be uninsured than those in expansion states. For example, 13.5% of Hispanic children in non-expansion states are uninsured compared to 6.1% of Hispanic children in expansion states.\n## Eligibility for Coverage among the Uninsured as of 2023"

              "Our findings were consistent with previous studies. Buchmueller and Levy evaluated the ACA\u2019s impact on racial and ethnic disparities in health insurance coverage and access to care, and found a large number of adults remain uninsured, and the uninsurance rate among blacks and Hispanics was substantially higher than the rate among whites []. Another study assessed the insurance patterns and instability from 2006 to 2016, and found despite the post-ACA instability reduction, over 25% of the U.S. population continued to have insurance gaps over a two-year period; and found disparities continued to exist between income groups, race/ethnicities, and regions []. Compared with the above evidence, our results added further empirical evidence on the combined effect of race and income on health insurance coverage in the US, and the uniqueness of our study was looking at the influence of multiple vulnerability traits together rather than separately as other studies did.\nThese findings have significant policy implications. To expand insurance coverage and eliminate racial disparities as called for by Healthy People 2030, concerted and targeted efforts are needed to both improve economic status and address disparities towards racial/ethnic minorities. To maximize limited resources, policymakers should target insurance coverage for the most vulnerable subpopulations, i.e., those with a convergence of predisposing, enabling, and need attributes of risk. The findings placed quantitative content to the theoretical framework of the vulnerability mode. As shown in this study, these are individuals who have low income and are racial/ethnic minorities. Significant progress at reducing disparities in care and quality across racial and ethnic groups is unlikely to be fulfilled without significantly expanding insurance coverage for this most vulnerable group."

              "#  Who Goes Without Health Insurance? Who Is Most Likely to Be Uninsured?\nThis chapter provides a portrait of the uninsured, to support the Committee's future reports about the consequences of uninsurance. Here, the Committee reviews and summarizes the published literature about what socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic characteristics describe the uninsured both collectively and as members of groups in the general population that are more likely than average to be uninsured. Supporting methodological information and data tables provide the numbers behind the general statements in the text and can be found in Appendixes and . All estimates are for persons uninsured during calendar year 1999 (the most recent available Current Population Survey data), unless otherwise indicated.\nThe large number and variety of Americans who are uninsured underscore the Committee's conclusion that the voluntary, employment-based approach to insurance coverage in the United States functions less like a system and more like a sieve. There are many ways to slip through the holes. People of all ages, levels of education, and in all states may be uninsured, although socioeconomic and geographic factors that affect coverage are highly correlated. One's chances of being uninsured increase if one works in an occupation or in an employment sector where employers are less likely to offer a health benefit, if one is self-employed or works for a small private-sector firm, or if one has too low an income to afford coverage.\nThe final section of this chapter includes estimates of the relative importance of key social, economic, demographic, and geographic characteristics to one's likelihood of being uninsured, based on a new multivariate analysis of published data. Most of the studies that the Committee reviewed are based on two-way (bivariate) analyses of a characteristic and the probability that an individual with that characteristic will be uninsured.",
              "Throughout the chapter, the Committee addresses two questions together:     \nWhat are the characteristics of the uninsured population?     \nWho is most likely to be uninsured?\nThe distribution of socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic differences in the general population under age 65 affects how these characteristics are distributed among the uninsured population because the relative size of specific population groups affects their representation among the uninsured. For example, the uninsured for the urban population is the same as that of the rural population, although four out of five uninsured people live in urban areas, reflecting the predominance of urban populations nationally.\n## HOW SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECT COVERAGE\nFull-time, full-year employment offers families the best chances of acquiring and keeping health insurance, as does an annual income of at least a moderate level (greater than 200 percent of the federal poverty level []). Insured status correlates highly with many aspects of employment, including work status, income level, educational attainment, occupation, and employer characteristics such as firm size and employment sector.\nEight out of every ten uninsured people are members of families with at least one wage earner, and six out of every ten uninsured people are wage earners themselves. Nonetheless, members of families without wage earners are much more likely to be uninsured than members of families with wage earners.",
              "Lower-income parents face income and other eligibility criteria that may prevent them from qualifying for , although their children may be covered. This may result in a family being partially insured. Since welfare reform in 1996, lower-income parents have been losing insurance coverage, with the de cline in public coverage greater than the increase in employment-based coverage. The impact falls disproportionately on lower-income mothers (Guyer and Mann, 1999; Garrett and Holahan, 2000; Klein, 2000; Guyer et al., 2001). Only 33 percent of women who move from public assistance to employment obtain coverage through their employer (Garrett and Holahan, 2000). Among low-income people (less than 100 percent of ), working parents are twice as likely to be uninsured as nonworking parents because nonworking, single parents often have very young children and are more likely to have Medicaid coverage (Guyer and Mann, 1999).\n## OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN COVERAGE\nThe nature and type of labor force participation determine whether individuals and family members obtain employment-based coverage. Foreign-born persons and members of ethnic and racial minority groups are more likely than average to be uninsured, although their smaller numbers in the general population mean that uninsured rates overall are dominated by the rates for U.S.-born citizens and non-Hispanic whites.\nMost uninsured people are U.S. citizens by birth (native-born residents comprise about 90 percent of the general population). The relatively small proportion of the general population comprised of naturalized citizens and noncitizens (immigrants) is significantly more likely than U.S.-born residents to be uninsured, although immigrants' uninsured rates decline with increasing length of residency in the United States."

Taking a close look at the data could illuminate ways to help expand health coverage to people who remain uninsured, from dismantling barriers to eligibility and enrollment to improving the scope and accessibility of outreach and enrollment assistance. The overall uninsured rate reached record lows in 2022, but to achieve further coverage gains and to reach racial equity in health coverage, it is essential to sustain and expand upon successful, more targeted policies.",

While it is true that health coverage rates vary across racial and ethnic groups, limiting analysis to broad racial categories \u2014 as is often the practice \u2014 can conceal the diverse experiences of communities within them. Disaggregating race and ethnicity into smaller groups could improve response rates on race/ethnicity questions, shed further light on health inequities, and uncover community needs.\nReasons that data are often not disaggregated into racial and ethnic subgroups can include sample sizes that are too small for precise estimation, concerns over privacy and surveillance, and the risk that users of the data will misattribute differences between groups and not account for the context of inequities such as racism, discrimination, and other structural barriers to opportunity. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which sets national race and ethnicity reporting standards, cites a lack of consensus in terminology as an additional barrier to adding racial and ethnic categories to the minimum federal reporting requirements."

One Delaware study found that the child protective services agency was more likely to become involved with families that had been randomly assigned to a program of lower welfare benefits, time limits, strict work requirements backed by financial penalties, and other limitations, relative to families receiving a modestly more generous traditional welfare program in the 1990s. The study was unable to determine whether these negative impacts on children were due to lower income, increased parental stress, or other factors associated with the stricter rules. The findings are consistent, however, with the previously mentioned study finding that child maltreatment and child protective services involvement fell after state and federal EITC expansions boosted family incomes. \n## More Research Is Needed, But Available Evidence Is Compelling \nThe bulk of evidence supports the conclusion that economic security programs play a strong role in helping low-income children, although there are exceptions. In science, including the social and behavioral sciences, individual studies are rarely conclusive by themselves; what matters is where the bulk of evidence lies. On balance, the evidence is strongly on the side of the importance of income assistance for low-income children.",

However, , the [Baby\u2019s First Years project, is assessing the effects of providing direct monthly, unconditional cash payments (of $333) to parents of infants and toddlers experiencing poverty; this work has found that payments led to modest increases in brain activity levels associated with learning and development. Evidence is also provided by quasi-experimental research that investigated](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2115649119) relationships between [policies and interventions that increase income](https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/publication/2022/child-allowance/benefit-cost-analysis) and improvements in child outcomes. For example, evidence is provided by research on welfare reform: An conducted using data from four experimental studies of welfare reform found that increased income was associated with improved academic outcomes, although only for young children (under age 6).

These findings suggest the value of social policies and programs that can reduce poverty and those that can reduce the effects of poverty.\n## Policies and Programs Can Reduce or Mitigate Child Poverty",
              "As noted, children living in or near poverty tend to have poorer health, lower academic attainment, and a greater chance of being poor in adulthood, relative to their higher-income peers. Rigorously conducted research\u2014both experimental and non-experimental\u2014suggest that [poverty itself is at the root of these differences](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25246/a-roadmap-to-reducing-child-poverty) because it affects most aspects of children\u2019s lives, ranging from food to housing to family interactions to school quality and neighborhood stress. However, there is a strong and growing research base that supports the efficacy of a wide range of programs and policies for reducing child poverty, mitigating its effects on development, and promoting long-term economic mobility. Such policies can include not just government safety net programs, but also , , and ; however, the research on the impact of these latter policies on child poverty rates is much more limited or findings are mixed (as in the case of ).\nMuch of the existing research on policy and program effectiveness has focused on the role of government programs in improving child and family economic well-being. Programs range from cash transfers and refundable tax credits, intended to directly supplement a family\u2019s income, to in-kind transfers, which typically provide direct services or vouchers that families can use to meet specific needs (such as nutrition, housing, health care, or child care needs). Both types of programs not only provide stability in a family\u2019s access to basic needs during economic downturns and unexpected hardships, but also support longer-term economic mobility by freeing up family resources that can be used to support parents\u2019 labor market participation and improve their access to higher-wage jobs. Such programs also include child care, transportation, and educational and skills investments.",
              "While the research evidence for the benefits of programs such as EITC and SNAP is robust, there is also a growing evidence base for a broader range of programs and services.

              "Income assistance programmes have received noticeable focus from researchers (e.g., ) and policymakers (e.g., ) as viable initiatives to address material hardship at a policy-level. These programmes are typically provided by governmental organisations to help cover basic household expenses such as food, clothing, and housing (). The nature and extent of income support schemes varies widely across different countries and according to individual circumstances, but examples of these programmes include tax credits, one-off cash transfers, unemployment benefits, and pensions. Although material hardship does not necessarily coincide with income poverty (; ), robust evidence indicates that when families receive direct cash transfers, this income \u2018boost\u2019 can help mitigate hardship (; ; ; ). For example, a study by showed expansions to an income assistance programme decreased the likelihood of hardship. In their study, difference-in-differences estimates were used to examine the effects of the 2021 expansion to the Child Tax Credit (CTC) for families in the US. Their results suggested that receiving the CTC led to a significant 14-percentage point decrease in the likelihood of facing food hardship compared with the pre-treatment hardship rate. These findings align with the conceptual framework proposed by for programmes and policies addressing child poverty. This framework explains income support programmes which directly augment family income can be pivotal strategies for poverty reduction by assisting families to acquire basic necessities. We draw on this conceptual framework in this study to highlight initiatives aimed at creating economic opportunities for families as mechanisms through which sustainable solutions to material hardship can be realised. Accordingly, the present study focuses on benefit receipt in the form of means-tested benefits that provide direct cash transfers to families",
              "The long-term findings from this study contribute to the existing literature in several ways. Firstly, these results align with the conceptual framework proposed by , suggesting income assistance can help mitigate material hardship for families by augementing income. Furthermore, these findings add to the body of evidence finding income assistance programmes mitigate hardship (; ; ; ). Previous work found short-term effects of benefits in reducing medical hardship (; ). Our results extend on these findings in that a composite measure of material hardship was assessed. Therefore, our results show that benefit receipt may also be effective in mitigating material hardship as a broader construct. Secondly, previous research has highlighted the lasting effects of benefit programmes for maternal economic factors such as maternal debt reduction () and improvements for maternal wages (). The results from the current study extend on these findings by demonstrating another area where there are likely long-lasting intra-generational effects of benefits\u2014for material hardship. By explaining the temporal trend wherein early benefit recipients exhibited a decreasing likelihood of hardship nearly 12 years later, this study highlights the potential lasting effects of benefits in mitigating hardship for families with children."

              "The findings of this study have important implications for scholars and policymakers. Results suggest that the experience of material hardship \u2013 which regularly impact millions of American households \u2013 is significantly associated with diminished health. This highlights the important role of funding, expanding, and better targeting social welfare programs. Such an approach might include expansion of federal programs like SNAP and housing programs, where expanded access has been associated with a reduction in hardship [\u2013], grant programs for local governments who have shown effectiveness with programs like Housing First [], and/or incentives for nonprofit organizations that alleviate hardship through measures like meal services and utility bill assistance [,].\nBecause material hardship is often chronic, policymakers should focus on solutions that are preventative rather than just remedial. Some examples include weatherizing homes, expanding access to solar energy [], low-cost medical screenings, low-income tax credits, basic income programs [], and reduced or free school lunch programs []. Such approaches would reduce the incidence of material hardship but also likely mitigate the secondary effect of cost and strain on the medical system."

              "Cost estimation models are tools that can assist policy makers and stakeholders to explore the costs and distributional effects of potential policy changes. In this report, the policies examined are those intended to improve access to high-quality early care and education (ECE) opportunities. Cost estimation models address two types of costs: the costs to providers of offering early care and education and the subsidy costs to public and private entities supporting early care and education. Both types of cost are relevant to understanding the impact of policy options.\nDifferent approaches may be appropriate for various categories of audience or user, such as professional policy or budget analysts as opposed to stakeholders, program developers, or administrators. In some cases, it is necessary to have a \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d model that considers all age groups (e.g., infants, toddlers, prekindergartners) and all types of early care and education (center based, prekindergarten, or home based). In other cases, a pressing policy issue may be best addressed by a model specifically designed for a single age group or ECE type (such as promoting access of all 4-year-olds to prekindergarten). An important constraint on cost estimation modeling is the availability of reliable and generalizable data on the costs of certain elements. For example, although facilities are necessary, few data are available on the status of physical facilities and the costs required to rehabilitate or replace them.\nThis appendix first discusses the key attributes of cost estimation models and considerations for desirable outputs of models. It then briefly describes some of the currently available cost estimation models.\n## ATTRIBUTES OF COST ESTIMATION MODELS",
              "Cost estimation models vary in their scope and attributes. For example, models may be limited in their geographic area or the range of services included in the estimate; they may also differ in presenting dynamic or static estimates. A static model is likely to underestimate costs as families shift their patterns of utilization when the policies being modeled enhance quality and financial accessibility of ECE options. In other words, families may use more hours and more expensive types of ECE in response to those policies. A dynamic model can reflect the changes in utilization likely to result from the specified quality improvements or changes in prices, facilities, and locations and factor these changes into the estimated costs.\nThe target geographic areas specified are an important and variable feature of estimation models. Some models refer to a large area, such as a nation or a state; others specify local jurisdictions, such as a city, county, or school district. The focus may even be further narrowed to individual program sites. Consideration of larger areas allows more averaging of data and findings, while assessing smaller areas or individual programs may require more detailed data and analysis. It may also be useful to nest smaller areas within larger ones, such as showing costs for a state, along with costs for each county or school district within the state.\nThe range of services included is another distinction among models. Some programs or policies require inclusion of ancillary or comprehensive services such as physical health and developmental screening, family supports, and referral to housing or employment services. These services can be covered either by augmenting the staffing specified for ECE programs or treating them as a system-level cost in the ECE estimates.",
              "Different agencies within and across federal, state, and local jurisdictions use various budgeting categories. In general, models that derive costs from detailed components and allow aggregation into an array of user-specified categories are most useful. Such models allow the greatest flexibility for components to be added in variable ways to match diverse budget structures and to provide outputs categorized by desired components.\nThis wide range of output requirements on cost estimates may overwhelm the user of the model with details. One approach is to \u201cunfold\u201d different levels of detail, depending upon the needs of the user. Thus, one tab in a worksheet may display total dollar costs and personnel requirements. A second tab might break these totals into components such as child-age groups, ECE types, and personnel versus nonpersonnel costs. A third tab might show detailed costs by staff category, salaries versus benefits, and different types of nonpersonnel costs.\nThis section briefly describes the following examples of currently available cost estimator models:\n  * Human Services Policy Center Cost Simulation\n  * Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) Cost and Staffing Calculator\n  * Provider Cost of Quality Calculator (PCQC)\n  * Center for Benefit-Cost Studies in Education (CBCSE) Cost Tool Kit\n  * Center on Enhancing Early Learning Outcomes (CEELO) Cost of Preschool Quality (CPQ) Tool\n  * Quality Rating & Improvement System (QRIS) Cost Estimation Model\n  * The Standardized Early Childhood Development Costing Tool (SECT)\n  * Professional Development System Cost Analysis Tool"

              "AHRQ Estimating Costs grantees identified key cost elements based on the literature and interviews with primary care clinic leaders to develop a variety of tools, including user-friendly spreadsheets, questionnaires, and online forms, with detailed instructions on how to collect cost data. Some of these tools are quite detailed, while others focus only on key cost drivers (e.g., staff time for various activities). Examples of these tools are provided in .\nIn one example, Miller and colleagues integrated sensitivity analyses into their Web-based tool, allowing clinic leaders to estimate their costs under different scenarios, such as changing staff mix and adding or removing transformation activities. This tool can be used to estimate costs of transformation efforts either prospectively or retrospectively. Additional information about this tool is provided in .\nGrantees used qualitative and mixed methods to describe study settings and methods to estimate costs. The ABC method was used to calculate costs from the clinic\u2019s perspective, while gross-costing methods were used to estimate costs from the perspectives of the insurer, staff model HMO, and grant program that funded primary care transformation efforts.\n#### Analysis Methods to Describe Study Settings and Transformations Implemented\nMost AHRQ Estimating Costs grantees used a case study method to describe key setting characteristics and practice changes. To develop narratives describing the transformation efforts, grantees used rich qualitative data collected through interviews and observations, as well as quantitative data about clinic size, populations served, and other practice characteristics.",
              "Shi and colleagues used a global costing method including both trend analysis and regression modeling to estimate the costs incurred by a grant program to fund primary care transformation efforts across 110 clinics within 24 health care organizations in a large metropolitan area. Grant program expenditure data were used to estimate costs for each participating health care organization and clinic, including personnel, fringe benefits, travel, equipment, supplies, and alterations and renovations. Grant expenditure data were collected at 6-month intervals over a 3-year period. The trend analysis tracked total cost, cost per FTE physician, and cost per visit over the study period. The findings showed the incremental cost for clinics that achieved NCQA PCMH recognition versus clinics that did not. The incremental cost methodology is also discussed in Zuckerman et al.\nShi and colleagues then used a Mann-Whitney test to determine if clinics that achieved PCMH recognition were significantly different from clinics that did not. Propensity score matching was used to identify and retain for linear regression analysis pairs of clinics that were comparable at baseline and differed primarily in whether they attained PCMH recognition during the study period. Linear regression models were used to control for factors other than PCMH transformation that may have affected cost, such as total number of visits, number of FTE physicians, patient demographics (e.g., sex, race, and age), and percentage of uninsured patients. Based on the results of a Hausman test, a fixed effects model was selected to control for unobserved clinic characteristics not varying over time that may have biased results. A difference-in-difference method was used to estimate the difference in cost changes before and after PCMH transformation, comparing clinics that did and did not ultimately achieve PCMH recognition.",
              "A micro-costing (or ABC) approach creates a cost estimate based on a detailed analysis of resources used and the unit costs of each resource. This approach is appropriate to assess the costs of PCMH transformation efforts for most clinics. The benefits of the ABC approach are that it can be used either prospectively or retrospectively, does not require access to aggregate data, can account for all clinic-level resources spent as well as opportunity costs, and is computationally simple (i.e., it does not require statistical analysis software or skills). However, this method is time consuming for both investigators and clinic staff. This method is also susceptible to recall bias (for retrospective studies).\nReport standardized results when possible. To help readers interpret and use the results from cost estimate studies, it is helpful to report results in standardized dollars (e.g., 2012 dollars) and provide metrics that adjust for clinic size (e.g., cost per member or per patient per month, per clinician FTE, or per visit).\n#### Research Gaps and Future Directions\nThe Estimating Costs research team\u2019s experiences highlight some research gaps and suggest promising directions for future research. The suggestions below build on input provided by AHRQ Estimating Costs grantees.\nThe use of a variety of methods and metrics to report the costs of primary care transformation efforts makes meta-analysis difficult. It may therefore be important for the field to develop a consensus on standardized measurement strategies to measure costs on a larger scale. A useful industry model is the Medical Group Management Association\u2019s use of annual cost benchmarking surveys of primary care practices."

              "Program scale may impact outcomes through different mechanisms. On the one hand, increases in scale may lead to an adverse impact on implementation quality leading to lower effectiveness. A recent -analysis of development programs, including those that focus on microfinance, financial literacy and women\u2019s empowerment, concluded that larger programs and programs that were implemented by governments had lower effects (). Indeed, program-specific evidence on other development interventions suggests that many programs that are successful at a smaller scale fail to achieve similar positive effects after scaling up (, ). More recent evidence indicates that in communities could explain the larger positive effects of interventions implemented by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) relative to interventions implemented by governments ().\nOn the other hand, service scale may also alter the costs of service provision if programs are able to achieve (). Previous evidence from health programs and interventions aiming to reduce gender-based violence indeed show that the average costs of these programs reduce significantly when they reach a larger number of program participants (, , , ). At the same time, more complex interventions like multidimensional livelihoods and financial inclusion interventions, may achieve diseconomies of scale if the programs face input or labor supply constraints (). The scale-up of SHG programs and other development interventions could either increase or decrease their cost-effectiveness depending on how scale changes the implementation quality, effectiveness, and costs of programming. In the absence of cost information, and specifically cost information about programs delivered at different levels of scale, the of large-scale programs as well as the policy implications of the studies showing an adverse relationship between impact and scale remain unclear.",
              "Understanding how costs change with scale is challenging since the nature of program and the number of activities often change as programs expand. Studies have pointed out that a good way to differentiate between short-run and long-run costs is by exploiting time-series data on program costs \u2013 a challenging endeavor given the lack of data on costs over time (). While a large dataset with data on costs of multiple programs over many periods and program components would be ideal, such data is almost never readily available. Instead, most studies observe cost data at one point in time or have limited data on the costs of different program components precluding researchers from studying how costs vary with changes in both program scale and program scope. Therefore, even a small increase in the number of cost data points over time can significantly increase the evidence-base on how costs change with scale, especially when data include costs of different program components. Time-series data are particularly important for women\u2019s groups like SHGs, that usually start with the goal of increased financial access to women, but with time, often include additional layers like health or farm and non-farm-based livelihoods initiatives.",
              "We examine the costs of increasing both the scope as well as the scale of services related to expanding \u2019s outreach of the SHG program. To analyze program scale, we consider costs from expanding the geographic supply of the program by adding more participants over time across the state. To analyze program scope, we study component-specific costs of the program, differentiating between expenditures related to key program activities (community mobilization and financial inclusion), and expenditures related to overall operations and management. We also study the changes in total program costs in relationship to core program activities, including the federation of SHGs, such as the formation of SHGs, VOs, CLFs, and bank linkages.\nWe estimate average program costs as costs per SHG woman targeted under the program, treating each  member added as an additional program output. While not all women received the same level of services with the same intensity, we estimate an average cost equivalent to an \u201cIntent to Treat\u201d cost \u2013 that is, expenditure per woman with access to potential program services. From \u2019s expenditure components discussed earlier, we consider three expenditure components \u2013 Community Institution Development, Special Technical Assistance Fund, and Project Management. We do not include Community Investment Funds when studying the relationship of costs with scale because it is disbursed to SHGs or their federations as a one-time grant or capital based on need and is usually a fixed amount (of INR 66,000, on average, [])."

The threshold for large projects in Fiscal Year 2013 is $67,500 (, Oct. 9, 2012). This proposed rule only affects large projects. \nProject Worksheets for large projects are developed by a FEMA Project Specialist, working with the applicant/subgrantee, and are submitted to a FEMA Public Assistance Coordinator (PAC) Crew Leader for review and processing. Large projects are funded on documented actual costs; however, work typically is not complete at the time of project approval. Therefore, FEMA obligates large project grants based on estimated costs. The obligation process is the process by which funds are made available to the grantee. The funds reside in a Federal account until drawn down by the grantee and paid to the subgrantee as the project progresses and actual costs are incurred. If FEMA approves a revised scope of work, a revised Project Worksheet is issued with a revised estimate, and funds are obligated or deobligated based on the revised estimate.\n### B.

(see [8]; [5]; [6])\n\n4) Administrative capacity, implementation timeline, and practical logistics (from costing/administration evidence)\n- Required resources and data.\n  - Needs: measurable personnel FTEs, enhanced IT and data capacity (time\u2011series cost data, facility/capital inventories), and clear tracking of provider vs payer flows to detect economies/diseconomies of scale (see [5]; [6]).  \n  - Bottlenecks: facility/capital information gaps and insufficient granular input data increase fiscal uncertainty and are common implementation bottlenecks (see [5]; [6]).  \n  - Timeline/precedent: large expansions typically require staged obligation and phased implementation; the materials highlight large\u2011project budgeting practices as relevant precedents (see [8]; [5]). (see [5]; [6]; [8])\n\n5) Unintended consequences, tradeoffs, and interactions (synthesis across evidence and costing work)\n- Labor\u2011supply effects and tradeoffs.\n  - Empirical finding: income itself drives many child benefits; labor\u2011market responses are heterogeneous and not uniformly large (see [1]; [2]).  \n  - Fiscal/design linkage: costing analyses stress that dynamic models must capture behavioral responses to correctly estimate fiscal effects and offsets (see [5]; [6]).  \n  - Mitigation/design: program design (benefit size, duration, conditionalities) can moderate tradeoffs; careful modeling and phase\u2011in help manage labor\u2011supply concerns (see [1]; [5]). (see [1]; [2]; [5])\n- Program interactions and targeting.\n  - Interaction risk: expansions interact with existing programs and marginal incentives; analysts must model these interactions to estimate net incremental costs and effects (see [5]; [6]).  \n  - Mitigation/design: use targeted eligibility rules, coordinate benefit tapering to avoid cliffs, and employ sensitivity analyses to anticipate interaction effects (see [5]; [1]). (see [5]; [1])\n- Fraud, leakages, and administrative error.\n  - Evidence and limits: the costing/administration materials note risks of fraud and leakage and the need for verification systems, but provide limited measured magnitudes in the reviewed texts; the program\u2011effect literature does not provide detailed measured impacts from fraud in these sources (see [5]; [6]).  \n  - Mitigation: strengthen eligibility verification, monitoring, and phased roll\u2011outs with built\u2011in evaluation to detect and reduce leakages (see [5]; [6]). (see [5]; [6])\n\n6) Net assessment and likely overall effects\n- Weighing benefits vs costs: empirical evidence indicates substantial benefits for child poverty, material hardship, health, and some education outcomes when income\u2011support programs are expanded; however, realizing net societal gains at scale depends on addressing fiscal costs, administrative capacity, and program interactions identified in costing work (see [1]; [5]).  \n- Conditions for net benefit: net benefits are likeliest when programs are well\u2011targeted, adequately funded (including realistic budgeting for capital and operating costs), and implemented with sufficient administrative capacity and evaluation (see [1]; [5]; [6]). (see [1]; [5])\n\n7) Policy\u2011relevant practical implications and recommendations\n- Prioritize program design features shown to drive child benefits (benefit size, duration, ease of access) while anticipating fiscal implications (design recommendation grounded in outcome evidence and costing practice) (see [1]; [5]).  \n- Phase\u2011in large expansions to allow administrative scaling, pilot testing, and corrections; use micro\u2011costing and scenario/sensitivity analyses before full rollout to improve budget accuracy (see [5]; [6]).  \n- Invest in administrative capacity (staffing, IT, eligibility verification, facility/capital data) up front to reduce under\u2011estimation of long\u2011run obligations and to limit leakages (see [5]; [6]).  \n- Build rigorous monitoring and quasi\u2011experimental evaluation into implementation to measure heterogeneous impacts and detect unintended consequences early (see [1]; [5]).  \n- When budgeting, disaggregate provider vs payer flows and present per\u2011participant and per\u2011unit cost metrics to aid transparency and targeting decisions (see [5]; [6]). (see [1]; [5]; [6])\n\n8) Key uncertainties and research gaps\n- Empirical gaps: need clearer evidence on long\u2011term adult outcomes for children exposed to scaled programs, and on heterogeneity of effects across subgroups (race/ethnicity, region, family structure) (see [3]; [1]).  \n- Implementation and costing gaps: insufficient facility/capital data and limited public documentation of fraud/leakage magnitudes constrain precise fiscal estimates and scalability assessments; more detailed micro\u2011costing and historical large\u2011project budget analyses are needed (see [5]; [6]; [8]).

              "Further, the Mothers Pensions of the early 1900s showed positive long-term effects on children even though it is unlikely that the program greatly increased children\u2019s participation in child care centers because it predated the widespread adoption of center-based child care.\nWelfare time limits and other stringent welfare rules \u2014 which, in the absence of adequate child care or other services, often function more as a cut in assistance than as a path to stable employment \u2014 have been found to have harmful effects in other studies as well. One Delaware study found that the child protective services agency was more likely to become involved with families that had been randomly assigned to a program of lower welfare benefits, time limits, strict work requirements backed by financial penalties, and other limitations, relative to families receiving a modestly more generous traditional welfare program in the 1990s. The study was unable to determine whether these negative impacts on children were due to lower income, increased parental stress, or other factors associated with the stricter rules. The findings are consistent, however, with the previously mentioned study finding that child maltreatment and child protective services involvement fell after state and federal EITC expansions boosted family incomes. \n## More Research Is Needed, But Available Evidence Is Compelling \nThe bulk of evidence supports the conclusion that economic security programs play a strong role in helping low-income children, although there are exceptions. In science, including the social and behavioral sciences, individual studies are rarely conclusive by themselves; what matters is where the bulk of evidence lies. On balance, the evidence is strongly on the side of the importance of income assistance for low-income children.",

And the more the programs increased participating families\u2019 incomes, the more their children\u2019s academic achievement rose, relative to peers assigned to a traditional, less generous welfare program.

              "There is still very limited evidence of direct causal links between poverty and children\u2019s development. However, , the [Baby\u2019s First Years project, is assessing the effects of providing direct monthly, unconditional cash payments (of $333) to parents of infants and toddlers experiencing poverty; this work has found that payments led to modest increases in brain activity levels associated with learning and development. Evidence is also provided by quasi-experimental research that investigated](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2115649119) relationships between [policies and interventions that increase income](https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/publication/2022/child-allowance/benefit-cost-analysis) and improvements in child outcomes. For example, evidence is provided by research on welfare reform: An conducted using data from four experimental studies of welfare reform found that increased income was associated with improved academic outcomes, although only for young children (under age 6). Studies of programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Medicaid also supply [causal evidence of the effects of poverty and income on outcomes and the positive impacts of mitigating poverty](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25246/a-roadmap-to-reducing-child-poverty).\nSimilarly, syntheses of studies examining the [effects of welfare reform initiatives](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1602768) on children\u2019s outcomes have found that programs that increased family income were associated with improvements in children\u2019s outcomes; by contrast, programs that increased employment without increasing income were not found to enhance outcomes. These findings suggest the value of social policies and programs that can reduce poverty and those that can reduce the effects of poverty.\n## Policies and Programs Can Reduce or Mitigate Child Poverty",
              "As noted, children living in or near poverty tend to have poorer health, lower academic attainment, and a greater chance of being poor in adulthood, relative to their higher-income peers. Rigorously conducted research\u2014both experimental and non-experimental\u2014suggest that [poverty itself is at the root of these differences](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25246/a-roadmap-to-reducing-child-poverty) because it affects most aspects of children\u2019s lives, ranging from food to housing to family interactions to school quality and neighborhood stress. However, there is a strong and growing research base that supports the efficacy of a wide range of programs and policies for reducing child poverty, mitigating its effects on development, and promoting long-term economic mobility. Such policies can include not just government safety net programs, but also , , and ; however, the research on the impact of these latter policies on child poverty rates is much more limited or findings are mixed (as in the case of ).\nMuch of the existing research on policy and program effectiveness has focused on the role of government programs in improving child and family economic well-being. Programs range from cash transfers and refundable tax credits, intended to directly supplement a family\u2019s income, to in-kind transfers, which typically provide direct services or vouchers that families can use to meet specific needs (such as nutrition, housing, health care, or child care needs). Both types of programs not only provide stability in a family\u2019s access to basic needs during economic downturns and unexpected hardships, but also support longer-term economic mobility by freeing up family resources that can be used to support parents\u2019 labor market participation and improve their access to higher-wage jobs. Such programs also include child care, transportation, and educational and skills investments.",
              "While the research evidence for the benefits of programs such as EITC and SNAP is robust, there is also a growing evidence base for a broader range of programs and services. Studies on the impact of Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program have found that these programs are linked to [increases in preventative care and reductions in preventable hospitalizations among children](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272704000076?casa_token=9gQfUIJ1aMAAAAAA:F5mF9DJa9QMUyUBwjWmp9aLR3BvdZA7sp9AKOBcNMH8kP9tKOkz6g-nQFD9D7zG5FMh4jjJLch4). Children who received Medicaid coverage in early childhood were more likely to have higher , higher , and improved as adults. Evidence on the effects of housing assistance is more mixed, but some evidence suggests that children who were young when their families received housing assistance (allowing them to move to low-poverty neighborhoods) had improved [educational attainment and adult earnings](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21156/w21156.pdf). Early education supports for families with low incomes, such as Head Start, can also promote family economic mobility by supporting increased parent and access to . At the same time, intergenerational economic mobility is supported by improved and among children served by these programs."

              "Income assistance programmes have received noticeable focus from researchers (e.g., ) and policymakers (e.g., ) as viable initiatives to address material hardship at a policy-level. These programmes are typically provided by governmental organisations to help cover basic household expenses such as food, clothing, and housing (). The nature and extent of income support schemes varies widely across different countries and according to individual circumstances, but examples of these programmes include tax credits, one-off cash transfers, unemployment benefits, and pensions. Although material hardship does not necessarily coincide with income poverty (; ), robust evidence indicates that when families receive direct cash transfers, this income \u2018boost\u2019 can help mitigate hardship (; ; ; ). For example, a study by showed expansions to an income assistance programme decreased the likelihood of hardship. In their study, difference-in-differences estimates were used to examine the effects of the 2021 expansion to the Child Tax Credit (CTC) for families in the US. Their results suggested that receiving the CTC led to a significant 14-percentage point decrease in the likelihood of facing food hardship compared with the pre-treatment hardship rate. These findings align with the conceptual framework proposed by for programmes and policies addressing child poverty. This framework explains income support programmes which directly augment family income can be pivotal strategies for poverty reduction by assisting families to acquire basic necessities. We draw on this conceptual framework in this study to highlight initiatives aimed at creating economic opportunities for families as mechanisms through which sustainable solutions to material hardship can be realised. Accordingly, the present study focuses on benefit receipt in the form of means-tested benefits that provide direct cash transfers to families",
              "The long-term findings from this study contribute to the existing literature in several ways. Firstly, these results align with the conceptual framework proposed by , suggesting income assistance can help mitigate material hardship for families by augementing income. Furthermore, these findings add to the body of evidence finding income assistance programmes mitigate hardship (; ; ; ). Previous work found short-term effects of benefits in reducing medical hardship (; ). Our results extend on these findings in that a composite measure of material hardship was assessed. Therefore, our results show that benefit receipt may also be effective in mitigating material hardship as a broader construct. Secondly, previous research has highlighted the lasting effects of benefit programmes for maternal economic factors such as maternal debt reduction () and improvements for maternal wages (). The results from the current study extend on these findings by demonstrating another area where there are likely long-lasting intra-generational effects of benefits\u2014for material hardship. By explaining the temporal trend wherein early benefit recipients exhibited a decreasing likelihood of hardship nearly 12 years later, this study highlights the potential lasting effects of benefits in mitigating hardship for families with children."

Results suggest that the experience of material hardship \u2013 which regularly impact millions of American households \u2013 is significantly associated with diminished health.

Such an approach might include expansion of federal programs like SNAP and housing programs, where expanded access has been associated with a reduction in hardship [\u2013], grant programs for local governments who have shown effectiveness with programs like Housing First [], and/or incentives for nonprofit organizations that alleviate hardship through measures like meal services and utility bill assistance [,].\nBecause material hardship is often chronic, policymakers should focus on solutions that are preventative rather than just remedial. Some examples include weatherizing homes, expanding access to solar energy [], low-cost medical screenings, low-income tax credits, basic income programs [], and reduced or free school lunch programs [].

              "Cost estimation models are tools that can assist policy makers and stakeholders to explore the costs and distributional effects of potential policy changes. In this report, the policies examined are those intended to improve access to high-quality early care and education (ECE) opportunities. Cost estimation models address two types of costs: the costs to providers of offering early care and education and the subsidy costs to public and private entities supporting early care and education. Both types of cost are relevant to understanding the impact of policy options.\nDifferent approaches may be appropriate for various categories of audience or user, such as professional policy or budget analysts as opposed to stakeholders, program developers, or administrators. In some cases, it is necessary to have a \u201cgeneral purpose\u201d model that considers all age groups (e.g., infants, toddlers, prekindergartners) and all types of early care and education (center based, prekindergarten, or home based). In other cases, a pressing policy issue may be best addressed by a model specifically designed for a single age group or ECE type (such as promoting access of all 4-year-olds to prekindergarten). An important constraint on cost estimation modeling is the availability of reliable and generalizable data on the costs of certain elements. For example, although facilities are necessary, few data are available on the status of physical facilities and the costs required to rehabilitate or replace them.\nThis appendix first discusses the key attributes of cost estimation models and considerations for desirable outputs of models. It then briefly describes some of the currently available cost estimation models.\n## ATTRIBUTES OF COST ESTIMATION MODELS",
              "Cost estimation models vary in their scope and attributes. For example, models may be limited in their geographic area or the range of services included in the estimate; they may also differ in presenting dynamic or static estimates. A static model is likely to underestimate costs as families shift their patterns of utilization when the policies being modeled enhance quality and financial accessibility of ECE options. In other words, families may use more hours and more expensive types of ECE in response to those policies. A dynamic model can reflect the changes in utilization likely to result from the specified quality improvements or changes in prices, facilities, and locations and factor these changes into the estimated costs.\nThe target geographic areas specified are an important and variable feature of estimation models. Some models refer to a large area, such as a nation or a state; others specify local jurisdictions, such as a city, county, or school district. The focus may even be further narrowed to individual program sites. Consideration of larger areas allows more averaging of data and findings, while assessing smaller areas or individual programs may require more detailed data and analysis. It may also be useful to nest smaller areas within larger ones, such as showing costs for a state, along with costs for each county or school district within the state.\nThe range of services included is another distinction among models. Some programs or policies require inclusion of ancillary or comprehensive services such as physical health and developmental screening, family supports, and referral to housing or employment services. These services can be covered either by augmenting the staffing specified for ECE programs or treating them as a system-level cost in the ECE estimates.",
              "Different agencies within and across federal, state, and local jurisdictions use various budgeting categories. In general, models that derive costs from detailed components and allow aggregation into an array of user-specified categories are most useful. Such models allow the greatest flexibility for components to be added in variable ways to match diverse budget structures and to provide outputs categorized by desired components.\nThis wide range of output requirements on cost estimates may overwhelm the user of the model with details. One approach is to \u201cunfold\u201d different levels of detail, depending upon the needs of the user. Thus, one tab in a worksheet may display total dollar costs and personnel requirements. A second tab might break these totals into components such as child-age groups, ECE types, and personnel versus nonpersonnel costs.

              "AHRQ Estimating Costs grantees identified key cost elements based on the literature and interviews with primary care clinic leaders to develop a variety of tools, including user-friendly spreadsheets, questionnaires, and online forms, with detailed instructions on how to collect cost data. Some of these tools are quite detailed, while others focus only on key cost drivers (e.g., staff time for various activities). Examples of these tools are provided in .\nIn one example, Miller and colleagues integrated sensitivity analyses into their Web-based tool, allowing clinic leaders to estimate their costs under different scenarios, such as changing staff mix and adding or removing transformation activities. This tool can be used to estimate costs of transformation efforts either prospectively or retrospectively. Additional information about this tool is provided in .\nGrantees used qualitative and mixed methods to describe study settings and methods to estimate costs. The ABC method was used to calculate costs from the clinic\u2019s perspective, while gross-costing methods were used to estimate costs from the perspectives of the insurer, staff model HMO, and grant program that funded primary care transformation efforts.\n#### Analysis Methods to Describe Study Settings and Transformations Implemented\nMost AHRQ Estimating Costs grantees used a case study method to describe key setting characteristics and practice changes. To develop narratives describing the transformation efforts, grantees used rich qualitative data collected through interviews and observations, as well as quantitative data about clinic size, populations served, and other practice characteristics.",
              "Shi and colleagues used a global costing method including both trend analysis and regression modeling to estimate the costs incurred by a grant program to fund primary care transformation efforts across 110 clinics within 24 health care organizations in a large metropolitan area. Grant program expenditure data were used to estimate costs for each participating health care organization and clinic, including personnel, fringe benefits, travel, equipment, supplies, and alterations and renovations. Grant expenditure data were collected at 6-month intervals over a 3-year period. The trend analysis tracked total cost, cost per FTE physician, and cost per visit over the study period. The findings showed the incremental cost for clinics that achieved NCQA PCMH recognition versus clinics that did not. The incremental cost methodology is also discussed in Zuckerman et al.\nShi and colleagues then used a Mann-Whitney test to determine if clinics that achieved PCMH recognition were significantly different from clinics that did not. Propensity score matching was used to identify and retain for linear regression analysis pairs of clinics that were comparable at baseline and differed primarily in whether they attained PCMH recognition during the study period. Linear regression models were used to control for factors other than PCMH transformation that may have affected cost, such as total number of visits, number of FTE physicians, patient demographics (e.g., sex, race, and age), and percentage of uninsured patients. Based on the results of a Hausman test, a fixed effects model was selected to control for unobserved clinic characteristics not varying over time that may have biased results. A difference-in-difference method was used to estimate the difference in cost changes before and after PCMH transformation, comparing clinics that did and did not ultimately achieve PCMH recognition.",
              "A micro-costing (or ABC) approach creates a cost estimate based on a detailed analysis of resources used and the unit costs of each resource. This approach is appropriate to assess the costs of PCMH transformation efforts for most clinics. The benefits of the ABC approach are that it can be used either prospectively or retrospectively, does not require access to aggregate data, can account for all clinic-level resources spent as well as opportunity costs, and is computationally simple (i.e., it does not require statistical analysis software or skills). However, this method is time consuming for both investigators and clinic staff. This method is also susceptible to recall bias (for retrospective studies).\nReport standardized results when possible. To help readers interpret and use the results from cost estimate studies, it is helpful to report results in standardized dollars (e.g., 2012 dollars) and provide metrics that adjust for clinic size (e.g., cost per member or per patient per month, per clinician FTE, or per visit).\n#### Research Gaps and Future Directions\nThe Estimating Costs research team\u2019s experiences highlight some research gaps and suggest promising directions for future research. The suggestions below build on input provided by AHRQ Estimating Costs grantees.\nThe use of a variety of methods and metrics to report the costs of primary care transformation efforts makes meta-analysis difficult. It may therefore be important for the field to develop a consensus on standardized measurement strategies to measure costs on a larger scale. A useful industry model is the Medical Group Management Association\u2019s use of annual cost benchmarking surveys of primary care practices."

              "Program scale may impact outcomes through different mechanisms. On the one hand, increases in scale may lead to an adverse impact on implementation quality leading to lower effectiveness. A recent -analysis of development programs, including those that focus on microfinance, financial literacy and women\u2019s empowerment, concluded that larger programs and programs that were implemented by governments had lower effects (). Indeed, program-specific evidence on other development interventions suggests that many programs that are successful at a smaller scale fail to achieve similar positive effects after scaling up (, ). More recent evidence indicates that in communities could explain the larger positive effects of interventions implemented by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) relative to interventions implemented by governments ().\nOn the other hand, service scale may also alter the costs of service provision if programs are able to achieve (). Previous evidence from health programs and interventions aiming to reduce gender-based violence indeed show that the average costs of these programs reduce significantly when they reach a larger number of program participants (, , , ). At the same time, more complex interventions like multidimensional livelihoods and financial inclusion interventions, may achieve diseconomies of scale if the programs face input or labor supply constraints (). The scale-up of SHG programs and other development interventions could either increase or decrease their cost-effectiveness depending on how scale changes the implementation quality, effectiveness, and costs of programming. In the absence of cost information, and specifically cost information about programs delivered at different levels of scale, the of large-scale programs as well as the policy implications of the studies showing an adverse relationship between impact and scale remain unclear.",
              "Understanding how costs change with scale is challenging since the nature of program and the number of activities often change as programs expand. Studies have pointed out that a good way to differentiate between short-run and long-run costs is by exploiting time-series data on program costs \u2013 a challenging endeavor given the lack of data on costs over time (). While a large dataset with data on costs of multiple programs over many periods and program components would be ideal, such data is almost never readily available. Instead, most studies observe cost data at one point in time or have limited data on the costs of different program components precluding researchers from studying how costs vary with changes in both program scale and program scope. Therefore, even a small increase in the number of cost data points over time can significantly increase the evidence-base on how costs change with scale, especially when data include costs of different program components. Time-series data are particularly important for women\u2019s groups like SHGs, that usually start with the goal of increased financial access to women, but with time, often include additional layers like health or farm and non-farm-based livelihoods initiatives.",
              "We examine the costs of increasing both the scope as well as the scale of services related to expanding \u2019s outreach of the SHG program. To analyze program scale, we consider costs from expanding the geographic supply of the program by adding more participants over time across the state. To analyze program scope, we study component-specific costs of the program, differentiating between expenditures related to key program activities (community mobilization and financial inclusion), and expenditures related to overall operations and management. We also study the changes in total program costs in relationship to core program activities, including the federation of SHGs, such as the formation of SHGs, VOs, CLFs, and bank linkages.\nWe estimate average program costs as costs per SHG woman targeted under the program, treating each  member added as an additional program output. While not all women received the same level of services with the same intensity, we estimate an average cost equivalent to an \u201cIntent to Treat\u201d cost \u2013 that is, expenditure per woman with access to potential program services. From \u2019s expenditure components discussed earlier, we consider three expenditure components \u2013 Community Institution Development, Special Technical Assistance Fund, and Project Management. We do not include Community Investment Funds when studying the relationship of costs with scale because it is disbursed to SHGs or their federations as a one-time grant or capital based on need and is usually a fixed amount (of INR 66,000, on average, [])."

The obligation process is the process by which funds are made available to the grantee. The funds reside in a Federal account until drawn down by the grantee and paid to the subgrantee as the project progresses and actual costs are incurred.

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites. \nThe Office of Child Care (OCC) administers the Child Care and Development Fund program (CCDF), which is the primary federal funding source to help families with low incomes access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children. Access to affordable high-quality child care has numerous short- and long-term benefits for children, families, and society, supporting child and family well-being in a manner that fuels prosperity and strengthens communities and the economy. Child care is a necessity for most families with young children and reliable access leads to better parental earnings and employment and supports parents' educational attainment.\nCCDF is the primary federal funding source for child care subsidies to help eligible low-income working families access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children.\nThe passage of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of 2014 reauthorized the law governing CCDF. The law defines health and safety requirements for child care providers, outlines family-friendly eligibility policies, expands quality improvement efforts, and ensures that parents and the public have transparent information about the child care choices available to them. Under the law, States continue to have flexibility within federal guidelines over key policy levers\u2014including subsidy payment rates, co-payment amounts contributed by the family, income thresholds for determining eligibility, and quality improvement investments.\n### Child Care Services Funded by CCDF",
              "Subsidized child care services are available to eligible families through certificates (vouchers), or grants and contracts with providers. Under the law, States must establish eligibility policies, including a period of at least 12 months before eligibility is re-determined, that promote continuity of care for children and families. The program provides parents with the choice of a range of provider settings and types\u2014including centers, family child care homes, relatives, and faith-based providers. Parents may select a participating child care provider that satisfies applicable state and local requirements, including health and safety requirements. Under the law, States must: ensure that these health and safety requirements address key areas (such as first aid and CPR); require that providers receive training in these areas; complete comprehensive criminal background checks; and conduct monitoring that includes annual inspections. Approximately 1.3 million children receive a child care subsidy from the CCDF program every month.\nA portion of CCDF funds must be used to improve the quality of child care and other additional services to parents, such as resource and referral counseling regarding the selection of child care providers. The 2014 law increases the minimum amount that States are required to spend for quality activities, and includes new funding for improving the quality of care for infants and toddlers. To improve the health and safety of available child care, CCDF lead agencies provide training, grants and loans to providers; improved monitoring; compensation projects; and other innovative programs. Many lead agencies are making systemic investments, such as developing quality rating and improvement systems and professional development systems. Tribes may use a portion of their funds to construct child care facilities provided there is no reduction in the current level of child care services.",
              "The CCDF allows states to serve families through a single, integrated child care subsidy program under the rules of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. States coordinate CCDF with Head Start, pre-k, and other early childhood programs. States can also transfer a portion of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families dollars to CCDF, or spend TANF directly for child care.\n### State and Tribal Child Care Plans\nAll states, territories and tribes must submit comprehensive plans every three years and conduct public hearings to invite public comment.\nA portion of CCDF is used for child care research, demonstration and evaluation activities. These funds are increasing the capacity for child care research at the national, state and local levels while addressing critical questions with implications for children and families. Funds have been awarded to support individual project areas, including policy research, research partnerships, research scholars and a web-based archive called Child Care and Early Education Research Connections.\nA small portion of the CCDF is used by the Office of Child Care to provide technical assistance to grantees. Its technical assistance network is designed to address the needs of states, territories and tribes administering CCDF.\nCCDF is authorized under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act (CCDBG) which was enacted under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The CCDBG Act was amended and reauthorized by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, and again by the CCDBG Act of 2014. CCDF made $9.5 billion available to states, territories, and tribes in fiscal year 2021. In addition, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriation Act (or CRRSA Act) provided $10 billion in supplemental CCDF monies to address the impacts of the coronavirus."

              "More from Bipartisan Policy Center\n\nThe Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the largest source for child care. CCDF funds are distributed to states, tribes, and territories to help them administer child care assistance programs for low-income working families. As conversations around federal and child care access dominate news cycles, understanding how child care is funded is key.\nCCDF was created in 1996 to help low-income workers child care. The fund is comprised of two financing mechanisms: the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) and Child Care Entitlement to States (CCES). CCDF combines CCDBG discretionary funds and CCES mandatory and matching funds into block grants for states, tribes, and territories to subsidize the cost of child care\u2014streamlining a one stop shop for administering and governing funding. It is housed in the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Child Care.\nCCDF allows states to provide eligible families with a subsidy to help pay for a licensed child care program for their child, so that they can work, attend job training, or enroll in an educational program. States are required to have one department, a \u201cLead Agency,\u201d responsible for creating and managing CCDF funds.\nLead Agencies must follow broad federal guidelines for eligibility but they have a significant amount of autonomy to restrict their own state regulations. CCDF federal guidelines require the child families are seeking assistance for to meet the following requirements:\n  * Be under 13 years of age;\n  * Live with one or more parents who are working or enrolled in a job training or education program;\n  * Live in a family whose income does not exceed 85% of the State Median Income (SMI); and\n  * Live in a family whose assets do not exceed $1 million.",
              "Lead Agencies often shrink eligibility for child care subsidies through stricter requirements on family income and work provisions. Based on the 2025-2027 state plans, submitted to ACF every three years to show compliance with CCDF regulations, 31 states restrict their family income requirement to lower than 85% of SMI. Stricter requirements are often necessary due to high demand for child care assistance and funding constraints.\nCCDF also directs Lead Agencies to implement health and safety regulations, child care workforce development systems, quality improvement activities, and other actions that promote the accessibility of child care for all. HHS last updated CCDF regulations in .\n## Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG)\nThe Child Care and Development Block Grant, perhaps the most well-known aspect of CCDF, is only one part of the federal money allocated through CCDF. CCDBG funds and regulates child care services across all 50 states with discretionary funding passed by Congress through annual appropriations bills.\nCCDBG discretionary funds are administered through CCDF to each state based on the following funding allocation formula:\n  * The number of children under age five living in the state;\n  * The number of children living in the state who qualify for the National School Lunch Program; and\n  * The state per capita income.",
              "The allocation of matching funds per state is determined by the number of children under age 13 living in the state. The Lead Agency must \u201cmatch\u201d those funds with their own funding, this time using their Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate.\nOccasionally, CCDF administers more than just CCDBG and CCES funding. States can transfer up to 30% of their [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BPC_ECI-TANF-FY21-Report_RV22023.pdf) block grant funds directly to CCDF\u2014but not all states do. In FY 2023, states transferred a total of $1 billion from TANF to CCDF, allowing for their child care assistance programs to serve more low-income, working families.\nOriginally created to support low-income working parents, CCDF\u2019s role has grown, becoming an integral program supporting accessibility, stability, and quality within the wider child care landscape. Understanding the fiscal intricacies of CCDF is crucial for creating future policy recommendations and the role the federal government plays in supporting child care access for all families.\nYour source for bipartisan policy updates and insights."

Last reauthorized in 2014, CCDF is comprised of both a mandatory component (not subject to the annual appropriations process), the Child Care Entitlement to States (CCES), and a discretionary portion, the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), which Congress must fund every fiscal year. In FY 2024/2025, CCDBG received $8.75 billion and CCES received $3.5 billion for a total of $12.35 billion in CCDF funding.\nCounty governments are responsible for administering CCDF in at least eight states, according to the most recent available state plans: Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. In FY 2024, these eight states represented $2.2 billion in federal expenditures (25 percent). County governments in these states may set policy related to eligibility, sliding fee scales, and payment rates as well as perform eligibility determinations, issue provider payments, connect parents with child care and more. Counties administering CCDF may contribute county general revenue funds to help meet the required non-federal match for the CCES.",
              "In December 2024, Congress passed a disaster supplemental relief package (P.L. 118-158) that included $500 million in CCDBG funds to address immediate childcare needs and support recovery efforts. Counties deeply appreciate the inclusion of CCDBG funding in the supplemental, and call for continued investments in child care to ensure the long-term well-being and resiliency of our communities. In FY 2024/2025, CCDBG received $8.75 billion and CCES received $3.5 billion for a total of $12.35 billion in CCDF funding. Funding for CCDBG remained at levels equal to FY 2025 in the President\u2019s FY 2026 Budget Request.\n  * The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the federal government\u2019s funding source for child care subsidies to help eligible low-income families access child care and improve the quality of child care for all children.\n  * Eight states delegate CCDF funding and administration to county governments: Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin.\n  * Access to high-quality, affordable child care is critical for promoting positive child development as well as encouraging workforce participation and access to education for low-income parents.\n  * Limited program resources, strict eligibility rules and expensive quality standards can challenge the ability of counties to meet the needs of local parents through CCDF.\n  * Counties urge Congress to provide increased funding for both the mandatory and discretionary titles within CCDF to help us meet quality standards, invest in child care infrastructure, boost supply and serve eligible families.\n  * Congress should provide counties with increased authority to set income eligibility, establish sliding fee scales and determine other eligibility factors related to work and education to best meet the needs of local families."

If their tax liability is less than the value of their child tax credit, they may be eligible for a refundable credit calculated using the earned income formula. Under this formula, a family is eligible for a refund equal to 15% of their earnings in excess of $2,500, up to $1,700 per child, the maximum amount of the refundable portion of the credit. The credit phases out for unmarried parents with income over $200,000 and married couples with income over $400,000. The amount of the credit by income for a taxpayer with one qualifying child is illustrated below.",
              "## Child Tax Credit Amount by Income Level\nInternal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 24.  \nThe child tax credit was created in 1997 by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 () to help ease the financial burden that families incur when they have children. Like other tax credits, the child tax credit reduces tax liability dollar-for-dollar of the value of the credit. Initially the child tax credit was a nonrefundable credit for most families. A nonrefundable tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer's income tax liability to zero. In contrast, a refundable tax credit can exceed a taxpayer's income tax liability, providing a cash payment to low- and some moderate-income taxpayers who owe little or no income tax. \nThe child tax credit has undergone significant changes over time. At the end of 2017, Congress expanded the credit through 2025 as part of the TCJA (). The TCJA temporarily doubled the maximum credit amount and more than tripled the income level at which the credit begins to phase out. It also made changes to the refundable portion of the credit, including increasing the refundable credit amount from $1,000 to $1,400 per child (adjusted annually for inflation; $1,700 in 2025) and lowering the refundability threshold from $3,000 to $2,500. Although these changes were scheduled to expire at the end of 2025, the FY2025 reconciliation law () made them permanent. That law also permanently increased the maximum child tax credit from $2,000 per child to $2,200 per child, while indexing it to inflation. \nData from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) indicate that the total dollar amount of the child tax credit has increased significantly since enactment from approximately $23 billion in 1998 to $118 billion in 2022, with the largest increase coming after the TCJA expansions and the one-year expansion of the credit in the American Rescue Plan Act () in 2021, as illustrated below.",
              "## Taxpayers with Children, by Income Level in\n% of All Taxpayers With Children |  % of Taxpayers who Receive the Child Credit |  Child Tax Credit as % of After-Tax Income |  Average Child Credit per Taxpayer  \n---|---|---|---  \nThe child tax credit was created in 1997 by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 () to help ease the financial burden that families incur when they have children. Like other tax credits, the child tax credit reduces tax liability dollar for dollar of the value of the credit. Initially the child tax credit was a nonrefundable credit for most families. A nonrefundable tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer's income tax liability to zero, while a refundable tax credit can exceed a taxpayer's income tax liability, providing a cash payment primarily to low-income taxpayers who owe little or no income tax. \nOver the past 20 years, legislative changes have significantly changed the credit, transforming it from a generally nonrefundable credit available only to the middle and upper-middle class, to a refundable credit that more low-income families are eligible to claim. Most recently, at the end of 2017, Congress expanded the credit as part of , often referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJA. The law significantly expanded eligibility for and the amount of the credit for many higher-income taxpayers, with a more modest expansion for lower-income taxpayers. This change generally offsets the suspension of personal exemptions for those with dependents. made these changes permanent, and also increased the maximum credit from 2025 onward.\nThis report provides an overview of the credit under current law and also provides some summary data on these benefits.

              "The recent , the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) passed by Congress and signed by President Trump in July, extended and expanded provisions of the [2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/tax/) (TCJA) that otherwise would have expired at the end of 2025, and included additional relief and support for American families. to the (CTC) drew interest from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle prior to the final package emerged as one of the primary levers to increase support for . Now that the reconciliation package has become law, it is important to understand how the CTC changed, how it stacks up against previous expansions, and how the new law will impact families.\nThe new law made the base credit permanent and increased it to $2,200 per child effective in 2025 (and adjusted for inflation in years after). It also made permanent the phase-out threshold rate of $200,000 ($400,000 for taxpayers married filing jointly) and the $500 nonrefundable credit for non-child dependents. The bill also continues to adjust the refundable part of the credit for inflation each year (in 2025, the maximum refundable credit is $1,700 per child).\nThe bill adjusted the eligibility requirements to now require valid Social Security numbers (SSNs) for both the qualifying child the taxpayer claiming the child (previously, the law only required an SSN for the child). In the case of a joint return, only one parent needs to have an SSN to be eligible to claim the CTC. highlights the changes to the CTC in OBBB, and the proposed version in the House reconciliation bill compared to prior laws.\n### _Table 1: Enhanced CTC Comparisons to Prior Proposals and Law_\n## Proposed Ways and Means Bill (2025)\n$2,200 per child in 2025 (inflation-adjusted annually, starting 2026) | $2,500 per child (temporary); reverts to $2,000 (inflation-adjusted) after 2028",
              "The changes to the CTC will impact families differently, depending on their income levels and eligibility status. For example, the reconciliation package\u2019s more stringent SSN requirements mentioned above will have an impact on the number of people eligible for the credit moving forward. The Tax Policy Center estimated that 500,000 children who would otherwise be considered eligible to the credit if no parent can produce an SSN to comply with the new requirement.\nThe CTC provisions will only partially aid low-income families, despite the increased credit amount, since the CTC\u2019s income parameters remain unchanged. And as the CTC is not fully refundable and many low-income families owe little to nothing in federal income taxes, some families do not benefit from the increases to the base amount of the credit.\nAn estimated [23.8 million children will benefit](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/house-and-senate-plans-boost-child-tax-credit-could-help-more-low-income-families) from the larger CTC; however, those from households with lower incomes will see a smaller impact. shows the credit schedule in 2025 for a single parent with one child. Under the new law, families with a lower adjusted gross income (AGI) between $0 and $26,000 receive the same credit as they would under TCJA in 2025. At an AGI between $27,000 and $243,000, families benefit more from the $200 boost than they did from the TCJA credit, before it phases out.\n### _Figure 2: CTC Schedule for a Single Parent of One Child Under TCJA and OBBB_"

              "* Read the latest Daily Deductions \n_This post has been corrected: The number of children in families that cannot receive the full CTC because their parents do not earn enough is 19 million, not 30 million._\nThe (CTC)\u2014the largest tax benefit supporting families with children\u2014 has swung through big changes in recent years. Generally, the pattern of expansion has been for the credit to be increased to a fixed level and then stagnate, which leads to rising costs eroding the value of the credit. \nThe 2025 reconciliation act, or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), differed from these recent expansion efforts. It permanently increased the maximum credit amount to $2,200 per child and indexed it for inflation. \nA permanent, bigger CTC is good news for many. OBBBA made the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u2019s (TCJA\u2019s) expansion of the CTC permanent, preventing the CTC from dropping from $2,000 to $1,000 per child ([alongside other related changes to family tax provisions](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tcja-didnt-change-child-benefits-most-families-children-very-much)). And, more than that, the OBBBA increased the maximum credit to $2,200, which will now grow with inflation after 2025 (Figure 1). These changes [help middle- and high-income families](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/children-deserve-more-shutdown-threats-and-continuing-resolutions) offset the taxes they owe.\nThese changes do little for families with low incomes, because the credit's pre-OBBBA phase-in rules remain in place. And, as under prior law, that amount grows each year with inflation. But the amount of credit a family can receive beyond taxes owed is limited to 15 percent of earnings above $2,500. A larger credit with these same phase-in rules means that more children now live in families that cannot receive the full CTC because their parents do not earn enough. TPC estimates that number jumped from about to under the new law,about 30 percent of all children.",
              "And there\u2019s more bad news. Average benefits will decline slightly under the new law for the lowest-income families with children\u2014largely because about additional children with Social Security numbers (SSNs) who cannot be claimed by will now be ineligible (Figure 2). Rather than qualifying for the CTC, they can get\u2014at most\u2014a $500 credit that can only be used to offset taxes owed. Average benefits for middle-income and higher-income families with children will increase by about $200.\nA basic principle of the CTC is that all else equal, larger families receive larger benefits. This is true for most higher-income families, but not low-income families. Because of the credit\u2019s , 1.1 million children in low-income families with multiple children will get the same credit as if their families had only 1 child under age 17. This could be changed by phasing the credit in faster for larger families who have modest earnings.\nIn all, the changes to the CTC were a mixed bag for families with children. A larger, permanent, inflation-indexed credit helps many families plan with greater certainty. But, despite research suggesting that investments in children with low incomes more than many other social policies, millions of children in low-income families remain excluded, along with the economic returns that come from investing in them.\nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)\nChild tax credit (CTC)/Child and dependent care tax credit (CDCTC)\nSubscribe to our newsletters today."

              "The Tax Policy Center estimates that slightly less than 90 percent of families with children received an average CTC of $2,520 in 2025. The average credit exceeds the maximum per child credit because families can have more than one child. Families with children in all income groups benefited from the CTC, but families in the lowest income quintile were least likely to benefit because fewer of them have sufficient earnings to qualify for the credit. Just under three-quarters of families in the lowest income quintile were eligible for a CTC, receiving an average credit of $1,610. The average credit was the smallest for this quintile because low-income families are most likely to be limited to the refundable portion of the credit, which was capped at $1,700 in 2025 rather than the full $2,200 limit for the nonrefundable credit (figure 2).\nThe percentage of families with children receiving the credit and the average credit received were the highest among moderate- and middle-income families. The share of families with children claiming a CTC was 93 percent in the second income quintile, 98 percent in third quintile, and 99 percent in the fourth quintile. The proportion of families with children receiving a credit then drops to 78 percent in the highest income quintile because the credit phases out at high incomes (figure 3).\nThe CTC improves the well-being of low-income families with children. The Census Bureau estimates that along with the EITC, the refundable portion of the CTC\u2014the ACTC\u2014lifted 6.4 million people out of poverty in 2023, including 2 million children. Researchers at Columbia estimated that in 2023, the CTC reduced child poverty by 17.1 percent (from a child poverty rate of 16.5 percent without any CTC to 13.7 percent).\n#### Recent History of the CTC",
              "For low-income families, the refundable portion of the credit has also expanded over this time period. Before 2001, the CTC was generally nonrefundable. EGTRRA made part of the credit refundable based on earnings beginning in 2001 with the refundable portion (i.e., the ACTC) available to low-income families with earnings over $10,000 (this amount was indexed for inflation). As a result of changes made in response to the Great Recession, this threshold was temporarily reduced to $8,500 for 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) further reduced this threshold to $3,000 for 2009 and 2010. Along with the Bush-era tax cut changes discussed above, the $3,000 threshold was also extended temporarily after 2010 and ultimately made permanent by Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act.\nThe refundable portion of the CTC under EGTRRA was originally designed in 2001 to coordinate with the earned income tax credit (EITC). Once earnings reached $10,020 for families with two children in 2001, there was no further increase in the EITC. The earnings threshold for the refundable CTC was set at $10,000 so families could now receive a subsidy for earnings in excess of that amount. Like the earning threshold amounts for the EITC, the $10,000 earnings threshold was indexed for inflation. When the earnings threshold for the refundable CTC was reduced\u2014first to $8,500 in 2008 and then to $3,000 beginning in 2009\u2014that link between the phase-in of the refundable CTC and the EITC was broken.\nBoddupalli, Aravind and Luisa Godinez-Puig. 2025. \u201c[\u2019One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019 Child Tax Credit](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/one-big-beautiful-bill-child-tax-credit-would-exclude-millions-american-children)[Would Exclude Millions of American Children.](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/one-big-beautiful-bill-child-tax-credit-would-exclude-millions-american-children)\u201d Washington, DC: Urban-Brookings Tax PolicyCenter.",

          "answer": "- Headline summary: The federal safety net for families combines limited, state\u2011administered child care/early\u2011childhood subsidies and targeted early\u2011education programs with sizable family tax credits (notably the Child Tax Credit); together they provide important cash and care supports but leave large gaps in subsidy reach, continuity of care, and coverage for the lowest\u2011income and undocumented\u2011or\u2011underdocumented families (see node_2; node_3).\n\na) Child care and early\u2011childhood programs \u2014 Eligibility and target populations: CCDF subsidized care targets children under 13 whose parents work/attend school or training with federal baseline guidance around \u226485% of State Median Income and citizenship/qualified\u2011noncitizen child rules, but states/tribes set final rules and asset/time limits (see node_2).  \n- Services provided and program scope: CCDF funds vouchers/certificates and grants/contracts to centers, family child care, relatives and other providers and requires health/safety standards and set\u2011asides for quality and parent services; Head Start/Early Head Start serve low\u2011income preschoolers and infants/toddlers with an education focus while CCDF primarily supports parental work across ages, creating scope differences that affect continuity of care (see node_2).  \n- Funding and current reach: Federal CCDF is a capped block\u2011grant (mix of discretionary CCDBG and some mandatory CCES/TANF transfers) with recent totals cited near $9.5B (FY2021) plus large pandemic supplements and combined CCDF figures around $12.35B, yet only about 1.8 million children received subsidies in an average month in FY2021 \u2014 roughly 15% of the ~11.5 million children who meet federal eligibility baselines (see node_2).  \n- Access/affordability/quality gaps and state variation: Because funding is capped and non\u2011entitlement, states ration subsidies and vary eligibility, payment rates and co\u2011payments; provider capacity and uneven quality investments further constrain parents\u2019 ability to work and children\u2019s outcomes (see node_2).  \n- Administrative barriers and effective reach: State discretion, waivers, waitlists and paperwork reduce effective reach\u2014leaving roughly 9.7 million federally\u2011eligible children without CCDF subsidy despite baseline eligibility (see node_2).\n\nb) Family\u2011targeted federal tax supports \u2014 Design, delivery, and refundability: The Child Tax Credit (CTC) provides a maximum credit (now indexed, $2,200 cited), with a refundable portion (ACTC) that phases in with earnings (15% above $2,500) and a refundable cap; delivery is through the tax system as cash, while nonrefundable portions phase out at higher AGIs (see node_3).  \n- Recent statutory changes and documentation rules: FY2025 reconciliation made earlier expansions permanent (raising indexed maxima) but tightened documentation by requiring valid SSNs for qualifying children/taxpayers (with a joint\u2011return exception), affecting accessibility for some families (see node_3).  \n- Reach and measured poverty effects: Aggregate CTC outlays rose (\u2248$118 billion in 2022) and surveys/estimates show ~90% of families with children received the CTC in 2025 (average benefit amounts reported), while refundable tax credits (CTC + EITC) together were estimated to lift ~6.4 million people (including ~2 million children) out of poverty in 2023 and the CTC alone is estimated to have reduced child poverty by ~17.1% (see node_3).  \n- Remaining coverage and adequacy gaps: Because the ACTC phases in with earnings and has caps, families with little or no earned income cannot access the full credit (analysts estimate ~30% of children live in families that cannot receive the full CTC due to insufficient parental earnings); tightened SSN/documentation and remaining refund caps create ongoing exclusions and take\u2011up issues (see node_3).\n\nc) Cross\u2011cutting unmet needs and interactions (integrating programmatic and tax supports): Insufficient child care subsidies blunt employment gains that tax credits could amplify: about 1.8M children receive CCDF vs ~11.5M eligible (\u22489.7M unserved), while CTC provided broad cash relief but cannot substitute for unavailable or unaffordable care needed for stable work (see node_2; node_3).  \n- Compounding administrative exclusions: State\u2011level rationing, waitlists and paperwork for CCDF plus tightened SSN/documentation rules for the CTC disproportionately exclude lowest\u2011income and immigrant families from both cash and care supports (see node_2; node_3).  \n- Continuity and child\u2011outcome gap: The limited reach of CCDF and the differing scope of Head Start (age/education focus) mean many children lack continuous, quality early care and education that cash CTC payments alone do not secure, undermining both parental employment stability and child development outcomes (see node_2; node_3).\n\nd) Prioritized unmet needs and short list of policy/design implications (highest \u2192 lower priority): 1) Expand subsidy scale and move toward entitlement\u2011like access: CCDF\u2019s capped funding leaves ~9.7M eligible children unserved, so increasing federal funding or changing entitlement rules would directly raise access and parental work capacity (policy: expand CCDF funding or create entitlement eligibility expansions) (see node_2) (node_2).  \n- 2) Make tax credits accessible to families with little/no earned income: Because the ACTC phases in with earnings and ~30% of children are in families that cannot receive the full CTC, making the CTC fully refundable or creating a non\u2011earnings\u2011based supplement would reach the poorest children (policy: eliminate or reduce phase\u2011in and refund caps) (see node_3) (node_3).  \n- 3) Reduce administrative/documentation barriers and align enrollment across systems: SSN/documentation rules and state\u2011level paperwork reduce take\u2011up; simplifying ID rules, aligning enrollment/outreach between tax filing and CCDF/Head Start, and allowing alternative verifications would lower exclusion (policy: simplify documentation and create cross\u2011program referral/auto\u2011enrollment pathways) (see node_2; node_3) (node_2; node_3).  \n- 4) Build provider capacity and target quality investments to expand affordable supply: State rationing reflects constrained provider supply and insufficient payment rates; boosting provider payment rates, workforce supports and targeted supply expansion tied to subsidies would improve access and quality (policy: increase subsidy reimbursement rates and workforce investments) (see node_2) (node_2).  \n- 5) Improve data, evaluation, and integrated delivery to target scarce resources: Current gaps in overlap data limit policy targeting; investing in data systems and evaluation to measure overlap of CTC recipients and CCDF/Head Start service use would inform efficient policy tradeoffs (policy: fund integrated administrative data and cross\u2011program metrics) (see node_2; node_3) (node_2; node_3).\n\n- Data limitation: Additional intersectional data are needed on the overlap between CTC recipients and families receiving CCDF/Head Start (including by state, immigration/documentation status, and work status) to quantify combined shortfalls and target policies; node_2 contains subsidy reach/state variation data and node_3 contains CTC reach/poverty\u2011impact data that together would support this analysis (see node_2; node_3)."

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites. \nThe Office of Child Care (OCC) administers the Child Care and Development Fund program (CCDF), which is the primary federal funding source to help families with low incomes access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children. Access to affordable high-quality child care has numerous short- and long-term benefits for children, families, and society, supporting child and family well-being in a manner that fuels prosperity and strengthens communities and the economy. Child care is a necessity for most families with young children and reliable access leads to better parental earnings and employment and supports parents' educational attainment.\nCCDF is the primary federal funding source for child care subsidies to help eligible low-income working families access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children.\nThe passage of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act of 2014 reauthorized the law governing CCDF. The law defines health and safety requirements for child care providers, outlines family-friendly eligibility policies, expands quality improvement efforts, and ensures that parents and the public have transparent information about the child care choices available to them. Under the law, States continue to have flexibility within federal guidelines over key policy levers\u2014including subsidy payment rates, co-payment amounts contributed by the family, income thresholds for determining eligibility, and quality improvement investments.\n### Child Care Services Funded by CCDF",
              "Subsidized child care services are available to eligible families through certificates (vouchers), or grants and contracts with providers. Under the law, States must establish eligibility policies, including a period of at least 12 months before eligibility is re-determined, that promote continuity of care for children and families. The program provides parents with the choice of a range of provider settings and types\u2014including centers, family child care homes, relatives, and faith-based providers. Parents may select a participating child care provider that satisfies applicable state and local requirements, including health and safety requirements. Under the law, States must: ensure that these health and safety requirements address key areas (such as first aid and CPR); require that providers receive training in these areas; complete comprehensive criminal background checks; and conduct monitoring that includes annual inspections. Approximately 1.3 million children receive a child care subsidy from the CCDF program every month.\nA portion of CCDF funds must be used to improve the quality of child care and other additional services to parents, such as resource and referral counseling regarding the selection of child care providers. The 2014 law increases the minimum amount that States are required to spend for quality activities, and includes new funding for improving the quality of care for infants and toddlers. To improve the health and safety of available child care, CCDF lead agencies provide training, grants and loans to providers; improved monitoring; compensation projects; and other innovative programs. Many lead agencies are making systemic investments, such as developing quality rating and improvement systems and professional development systems. Tribes may use a portion of their funds to construct child care facilities provided there is no reduction in the current level of child care services.",
              "The CCDF allows states to serve families through a single, integrated child care subsidy program under the rules of the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. States coordinate CCDF with Head Start, pre-k, and other early childhood programs. States can also transfer a portion of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families dollars to CCDF, or spend TANF directly for child care.\n### State and Tribal Child Care Plans\nAll states, territories and tribes must submit comprehensive plans every three years and conduct public hearings to invite public comment.\nA portion of CCDF is used for child care research, demonstration and evaluation activities. These funds are increasing the capacity for child care research at the national, state and local levels while addressing critical questions with implications for children and families. Funds have been awarded to support individual project areas, including policy research, research partnerships, research scholars and a web-based archive called Child Care and Early Education Research Connections.\nA small portion of the CCDF is used by the Office of Child Care to provide technical assistance to grantees. Its technical assistance network is designed to address the needs of states, territories and tribes administering CCDF.\nCCDF is authorized under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act (CCDBG) which was enacted under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The CCDBG Act was amended and reauthorized by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, and again by the CCDBG Act of 2014. CCDF made $9.5 billion available to states, territories, and tribes in fiscal year 2021. In addition, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriation Act (or CRRSA Act) provided $10 billion in supplemental CCDF monies to address the impacts of the coronavirus."

              "More from Bipartisan Policy Center\n\nThe Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) is the largest source for child care. CCDF funds are distributed to states, tribes, and territories to help them administer child care assistance programs for low-income working families. As conversations around federal and child care access dominate news cycles, understanding how child care is funded is key.\nCCDF was created in 1996 to help low-income workers child care. The fund is comprised of two financing mechanisms: the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) and Child Care Entitlement to States (CCES). CCDF combines CCDBG discretionary funds and CCES mandatory and matching funds into block grants for states, tribes, and territories to subsidize the cost of child care\u2014streamlining a one stop shop for administering and governing funding. It is housed in the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Child Care.\nCCDF allows states to provide eligible families with a subsidy to help pay for a licensed child care program for their child, so that they can work, attend job training, or enroll in an educational program. States are required to have one department, a \u201cLead Agency,\u201d responsible for creating and managing CCDF funds.\nLead Agencies must follow broad federal guidelines for eligibility but they have a significant amount of autonomy to restrict their own state regulations. CCDF federal guidelines require the child families are seeking assistance for to meet the following requirements:\n  * Be under 13 years of age;\n  * Live with one or more parents who are working or enrolled in a job training or education program;\n  * Live in a family whose income does not exceed 85% of the State Median Income (SMI); and\n  * Live in a family whose assets do not exceed $1 million.",
              "Lead Agencies often shrink eligibility for child care subsidies through stricter requirements on family income and work provisions. Based on the 2025-2027 state plans, submitted to ACF every three years to show compliance with CCDF regulations, 31 states restrict their family income requirement to lower than 85% of SMI. Stricter requirements are often necessary due to high demand for child care assistance and funding constraints.\nCCDF also directs Lead Agencies to implement health and safety regulations, child care workforce development systems, quality improvement activities, and other actions that promote the accessibility of child care for all. HHS last updated CCDF regulations in .\n## Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG)\nThe Child Care and Development Block Grant, perhaps the most well-known aspect of CCDF, is only one part of the federal money allocated through CCDF. CCDBG funds and regulates child care services across all 50 states with discretionary funding passed by Congress through annual appropriations bills.\nCCDBG discretionary funds are administered through CCDF to each state based on the following funding allocation formula:\n  * The number of children under age five living in the state;\n  * The number of children living in the state who qualify for the National School Lunch Program; and\n  * The state per capita income.",
              "The allocation of matching funds per state is determined by the number of children under age 13 living in the state. The Lead Agency must \u201cmatch\u201d those funds with their own funding, this time using their Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate.\nOccasionally, CCDF administers more than just CCDBG and CCES funding. States can transfer up to 30% of their [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/download/?file=/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BPC_ECI-TANF-FY21-Report_RV22023.pdf) block grant funds directly to CCDF\u2014but not all states do. In FY 2023, states transferred a total of $1 billion from TANF to CCDF, allowing for their child care assistance programs to serve more low-income, working families.\nOriginally created to support low-income working parents, CCDF\u2019s role has grown, becoming an integral program supporting accessibility, stability, and quality within the wider child care landscape. Understanding the fiscal intricacies of CCDF is crucial for creating future policy recommendations and the role the federal government plays in supporting child care access for all families.\nYour source for bipartisan policy updates and insights."

In FY 2024/2025, CCDBG received $8.75 billion and CCES received $3.5 billion for a total of $12.35 billion in CCDF funding.\nCounty governments are responsible for administering CCDF in at least eight states, according to the most recent available state plans: Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin. In FY 2024, these eight states represented $2.2 billion in federal expenditures (25 percent). County governments in these states may set policy related to eligibility, sliding fee scales, and payment rates as well as perform eligibility determinations, issue provider payments, connect parents with child care and more.

              "# The Child Tax Credit: How It Works and Who Receives It\n## CRS PRODUCT (LIBRARY OF CONGRESS)\nBudget, Public Finance & Taxation; Social Welfare  \n\nThe Child Tax Credit: How It Works and Who Receives It\nUpdated November 13, 2025 (R41873) [Jump to Main Text of Report](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R41873#Content)\n\nThis report provides an overview of the child tax credit under current law, including a review of changes made by (also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJA) and (the FY2025 reconciliation law). \nThe child tax credit allows eligible taxpayers to reduce their federal income tax liability by up to $2,200 per qualifying child (indexed to inflation). If their tax liability is less than the value of their child tax credit, they may be eligible for a refundable credit calculated using the earned income formula. Under this formula, a family is eligible for a refund equal to 15% of their earnings in excess of $2,500, up to $1,700 per child, the maximum amount of the refundable portion of the credit. The credit phases out for unmarried parents with income over $200,000 and married couples with income over $400,000. The amount of the credit by income for a taxpayer with one qualifying child is illustrated below.",
              "## Child Tax Credit Amount by Income Level\nInternal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 24.  \nThe child tax credit was created in 1997 by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 () to help ease the financial burden that families incur when they have children. Like other tax credits, the child tax credit reduces tax liability dollar-for-dollar of the value of the credit. Initially the child tax credit was a nonrefundable credit for most families. A nonrefundable tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer's income tax liability to zero. In contrast, a refundable tax credit can exceed a taxpayer's income tax liability, providing a cash payment to low- and some moderate-income taxpayers who owe little or no income tax. \nThe child tax credit has undergone significant changes over time. At the end of 2017, Congress expanded the credit through 2025 as part of the TCJA (). The TCJA temporarily doubled the maximum credit amount and more than tripled the income level at which the credit begins to phase out. It also made changes to the refundable portion of the credit, including increasing the refundable credit amount from $1,000 to $1,400 per child (adjusted annually for inflation; $1,700 in 2025) and lowering the refundability threshold from $3,000 to $2,500. Although these changes were scheduled to expire at the end of 2025, the FY2025 reconciliation law () made them permanent. That law also permanently increased the maximum child tax credit from $2,000 per child to $2,200 per child, while indexing it to inflation. \nData from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) indicate that the total dollar amount of the child tax credit has increased significantly since enactment from approximately $23 billion in 1998 to $118 billion in 2022, with the largest increase coming after the TCJA expansions and the one-year expansion of the credit in the American Rescue Plan Act () in 2021, as illustrated below.",
              "## Taxpayers with Children, by Income Level in\n% of All Taxpayers With Children |  % of Taxpayers who Receive the Child Credit |  Child Tax Credit as % of After-Tax Income |  Average Child Credit per Taxpayer  \n---|---|---|---  \nThe child tax credit was created in 1997 by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 () to help ease the financial burden that families incur when they have children. Like other tax credits, the child tax credit reduces tax liability dollar for dollar of the value of the credit. Initially the child tax credit was a nonrefundable credit for most families. A nonrefundable tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer's income tax liability to zero, while a refundable tax credit can exceed a taxpayer's income tax liability, providing a cash payment primarily to low-income taxpayers who owe little or no income tax. \nOver the past 20 years, legislative changes have significantly changed the credit, transforming it from a generally nonrefundable credit available only to the middle and upper-middle class, to a refundable credit that more low-income families are eligible to claim. Most recently, at the end of 2017, Congress expanded the credit as part of , often referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJA. The law significantly expanded eligibility for and the amount of the credit for many higher-income taxpayers, with a more modest expansion for lower-income taxpayers. This change generally offsets the suspension of personal exemptions for those with dependents. made these changes permanent, and also increased the maximum credit from 2025 onward.\nThis report provides an overview of the credit under current law and also provides some summary data on these benefits.

              "The recent , the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) passed by Congress and signed by President Trump in July, extended and expanded provisions of the [2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/tax/) (TCJA) that otherwise would have expired at the end of 2025, and included additional relief and support for American families. to the (CTC) drew interest from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle prior to the final package emerged as one of the primary levers to increase support for . Now that the reconciliation package has become law, it is important to understand how the CTC changed, how it stacks up against previous expansions, and how the new law will impact families.\nThe new law made the base credit permanent and increased it to $2,200 per child effective in 2025 (and adjusted for inflation in years after). It also made permanent the phase-out threshold rate of $200,000 ($400,000 for taxpayers married filing jointly) and the $500 nonrefundable credit for non-child dependents. The bill also continues to adjust the refundable part of the credit for inflation each year (in 2025, the maximum refundable credit is $1,700 per child).\nThe bill adjusted the eligibility requirements to now require valid Social Security numbers (SSNs) for both the qualifying child the taxpayer claiming the child (previously, the law only required an SSN for the child). In the case of a joint return, only one parent needs to have an SSN to be eligible to claim the CTC. highlights the changes to the CTC in OBBB, and the proposed version in the House reconciliation bill compared to prior laws.\n### _Table 1: Enhanced CTC Comparisons to Prior Proposals and Law_\n## Proposed Ways and Means Bill (2025)\n$2,200 per child in 2025 (inflation-adjusted annually, starting 2026) | $2,500 per child (temporary); reverts to $2,000 (inflation-adjusted) after 2028",
              "The changes to the CTC will impact families differently, depending on their income levels and eligibility status. For example, the reconciliation package\u2019s more stringent SSN requirements mentioned above will have an impact on the number of people eligible for the credit moving forward. The Tax Policy Center estimated that 500,000 children who would otherwise be considered eligible to the credit if no parent can produce an SSN to comply with the new requirement.\nThe CTC provisions will only partially aid low-income families, despite the increased credit amount, since the CTC\u2019s income parameters remain unchanged. And as the CTC is not fully refundable and many low-income families owe little to nothing in federal income taxes, some families do not benefit from the increases to the base amount of the credit.\nAn estimated [23.8 million children will benefit](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/house-and-senate-plans-boost-child-tax-credit-could-help-more-low-income-families) from the larger CTC; however, those from households with lower incomes will see a smaller impact. shows the credit schedule in 2025 for a single parent with one child. Under the new law, families with a lower adjusted gross income (AGI) between $0 and $26,000 receive the same credit as they would under TCJA in 2025. At an AGI between $27,000 and $243,000, families benefit more from the $200 boost than they did from the TCJA credit, before it phases out.\n### _Figure 2: CTC Schedule for a Single Parent of One Child Under TCJA and OBBB_"

              "* Read the latest Daily Deductions \n_This post has been corrected: The number of children in families that cannot receive the full CTC because their parents do not earn enough is 19 million, not 30 million._\nThe (CTC)\u2014the largest tax benefit supporting families with children\u2014 has swung through big changes in recent years. Generally, the pattern of expansion has been for the credit to be increased to a fixed level and then stagnate, which leads to rising costs eroding the value of the credit. \nThe 2025 reconciliation act, or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), differed from these recent expansion efforts. It permanently increased the maximum credit amount to $2,200 per child and indexed it for inflation. \nA permanent, bigger CTC is good news for many. OBBBA made the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u2019s (TCJA\u2019s) expansion of the CTC permanent, preventing the CTC from dropping from $2,000 to $1,000 per child ([alongside other related changes to family tax provisions](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tcja-didnt-change-child-benefits-most-families-children-very-much)). And, more than that, the OBBBA increased the maximum credit to $2,200, which will now grow with inflation after 2025 (Figure 1). These changes [help middle- and high-income families](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/children-deserve-more-shutdown-threats-and-continuing-resolutions) offset the taxes they owe.\nThese changes do little for families with low incomes, because the credit's pre-OBBBA phase-in rules remain in place. And, as under prior law, that amount grows each year with inflation. But the amount of credit a family can receive beyond taxes owed is limited to 15 percent of earnings above $2,500. A larger credit with these same phase-in rules means that more children now live in families that cannot receive the full CTC because their parents do not earn enough. TPC estimates that number jumped from about to under the new law,about 30 percent of all children.",
              "And there\u2019s more bad news. Average benefits will decline slightly under the new law for the lowest-income families with children\u2014largely because about additional children with Social Security numbers (SSNs) who cannot be claimed by will now be ineligible (Figure 2). Rather than qualifying for the CTC, they can get\u2014at most\u2014a $500 credit that can only be used to offset taxes owed. Average benefits for middle-income and higher-income families with children will increase by about $200.\nA basic principle of the CTC is that all else equal, larger families receive larger benefits. This is true for most higher-income families, but not low-income families. Because of the credit\u2019s , 1.1 million children in low-income families with multiple children will get the same credit as if their families had only 1 child under age 17. This could be changed by phasing the credit in faster for larger families who have modest earnings.\nIn all, the changes to the CTC were a mixed bag for families with children. A larger, permanent, inflation-indexed credit helps many families plan with greater certainty. But, despite research suggesting that investments in children with low incomes more than many other social policies, millions of children in low-income families remain excluded, along with the economic returns that come from investing in them.\nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)\nChild tax credit (CTC)/Child and dependent care tax credit (CDCTC)\nSubscribe to our newsletters today."

              "The Tax Policy Center estimates that slightly less than 90 percent of families with children received an average CTC of $2,520 in 2025. The average credit exceeds the maximum per child credit because families can have more than one child. Families with children in all income groups benefited from the CTC, but families in the lowest income quintile were least likely to benefit because fewer of them have sufficient earnings to qualify for the credit. Just under three-quarters of families in the lowest income quintile were eligible for a CTC, receiving an average credit of $1,610. The average credit was the smallest for this quintile because low-income families are most likely to be limited to the refundable portion of the credit, which was capped at $1,700 in 2025 rather than the full $2,200 limit for the nonrefundable credit (figure 2).\nThe percentage of families with children receiving the credit and the average credit received were the highest among moderate- and middle-income families. The share of families with children claiming a CTC was 93 percent in the second income quintile, 98 percent in third quintile, and 99 percent in the fourth quintile. The proportion of families with children receiving a credit then drops to 78 percent in the highest income quintile because the credit phases out at high incomes (figure 3).\nThe CTC improves the well-being of low-income families with children. The Census Bureau estimates that along with the EITC, the refundable portion of the CTC\u2014the ACTC\u2014lifted 6.4 million people out of poverty in 2023, including 2 million children. Researchers at Columbia estimated that in 2023, the CTC reduced child poverty by 17.1 percent (from a child poverty rate of 16.5 percent without any CTC to 13.7 percent).\n#### Recent History of the CTC",
              "For low-income families, the refundable portion of the credit has also expanded over this time period. Before 2001, the CTC was generally nonrefundable. EGTRRA made part of the credit refundable based on earnings beginning in 2001 with the refundable portion (i.e., the ACTC) available to low-income families with earnings over $10,000 (this amount was indexed for inflation). As a result of changes made in response to the Great Recession, this threshold was temporarily reduced to $8,500 for 2008. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) further reduced this threshold to $3,000 for 2009 and 2010. Along with the Bush-era tax cut changes discussed above, the $3,000 threshold was also extended temporarily after 2010 and ultimately made permanent by Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act.\nThe refundable portion of the CTC under EGTRRA was originally designed in 2001 to coordinate with the earned income tax credit (EITC). Once earnings reached $10,020 for families with two children in 2001, there was no further increase in the EITC. The earnings threshold for the refundable CTC was set at $10,000 so families could now receive a subsidy for earnings in excess of that amount. Like the earning threshold amounts for the EITC, the $10,000 earnings threshold was indexed for inflation. When the earnings threshold for the refundable CTC was reduced\u2014first to $8,500 in 2008 and then to $3,000 beginning in 2009\u2014that link between the phase-in of the refundable CTC and the EITC was broken.\nBoddupalli, Aravind and Luisa Godinez-Puig. 2025. \u201c[\u2019One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019 Child Tax Credit](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/one-big-beautiful-bill-child-tax-credit-would-exclude-millions-american-children)[Would Exclude Millions of American Children.](https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/one-big-beautiful-bill-child-tax-credit-would-exclude-millions-american-children)\u201d Washington, DC: Urban-Brookings Tax PolicyCenter.",
