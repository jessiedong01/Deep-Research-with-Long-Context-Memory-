        "## The AI arms race has officially begun!\nIn recent years, the (AI) race has been heating up, with countries around the world vying for supremacy in this cutting-edge field. But who is really leading the pack? Here\u2019s a look at some of the major contenders.\n## The United States is the clear leader in AI development, with major tech companies headquartered there leading the charge\nThe United States has indisputably become the primary hub for artificial intelligence development, with tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft at the forefront of AI-driven research. As the race to dominate AI grows ever more competitive around the world, companies within the U.S. are exploring new opportunities to strengthen their foothold in the industry through acquisitions, sharing deals and internal advances. Their goal: to become a major player in an industry that is expected to reach upwards of $118 billion by 2025. While competitors in China and other parts of the world are set on challenging US dominance, U.S.-based firms continue to push forward with cutting-edge initiatives that position them as AI leaders for years to come.\n## China is a close second, with the government investing heavily in AI research and development\nWhile the USA is currently leading the AI Arms race, China is quickly becoming a close second. In fact, the government of China has been investing heavily in AI research and development, thus taking steps to try and overtake the USA in this new technological race. Major corporations including Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent are all actively involved in pushing China\u2019s AI capabilities to new heights, with many of their efforts creating groundbreaking results that have pushed the boundaries of AI like never before. Despite this investment and dedicated work, it remains to be seen whether or not China will eventually bridge the gap between itself and the USA in terms of AI prowess; only time will tell in this ever-changing field of technology.",
        "## Other countries like Canada, Japan, and South Korea are also making significant strides in AI technology\nWith China and the US duking it out to become the top AI superpower, other countries such as Canada, Japan, and South Korea have been quietly forging ahead with their own initiatives in AI technology. Canada introduced an AI Strategy backed by $125 million to promote research and develop strong talent advances in 2018. Japan has also stepped up its game recently with their \u201cSociety 5.0\u201d plan which incorporates AI elements into a new vision for national development. South Korea has vowed to become an AI powerhouse through collaboration between the by allocating 14 trillion won for the purpose of bolstering their national competitiveness in the field. These investments reveal that although China and the US may be dominating headlines when it comes to the AI arm race, there are plenty more competitors looking to take control of this prominent field.\nChina is one of the leading countries in the (AI) arms race, investing heavily to increase their research and development capabilities. The Chinese government has allocated billions of dollars towards developing the next generation of AI technology, from autonomous vehicles to facial recognition systems. Major corporations such as Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent are also involved in AI-driven projects, and have had success in pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible. They are set on challenging the US\u2019s dominance in this burgeoning industry, and if they continue their progress, China may become a serious contender in the coming years.\n## Europe as a whole is lagging behind in AI development, but individual countries like France and Germany are starting to catch up",
        "## Ultimately, it\u2019s important for all countries to be involved in the development of AI technology to ensure that its benefits are shared by everyone\nAs the competitive AI arms race accelerates into the future, it is vitally important that all countries be involved in order to ensure that the technology\u2019s benefits are shared equally by everyone. This is particularly important when considering the potential ethical, economic, and military implications of artificial intelligence \u2013 none of which should be exclusive to a single nation or group of nations. AI can unlock tremendous advances in healthcare, mobility, and countless other areas; if the technology is allowed to remain unchecked and exclusive only to certain areas there could easily be major ramifications for global stability and equity. By keeping everyone involved in the discussion it\u2019s possible to keep a level playing field in terms of available resources, guaranteeing a fair chance for advancement regardless of geographic or financial position. Ultimately, with such powerful technology at our disposal, it\u2019s essential for every nation on earth to work together in order to shape a collective future where everybody can thrive.\nThe global AI race is one that all countries should be involved in, as the benefits of this technology are too great to be left to just a few nations. The United States is currently leading the way, with major tech companies investing heavily in research and development. However, China is not far behind, and other countries like Canada, Japan, and South Korea are also making significant strides. Europe as a whole is lagging behind at the moment, but individual countries like France and Germany are starting to catch up. Ultimately, it\u2019s important for all countries to be involved in the development of AI technology to ensure that its benefits are shared by everyone."

        "Which Countries Are Leading the Global Arms Race?\nAbhishek says, \u201cWhen we look at these four dimensions, we see that China is putting a lot of effort into AI and building these capabilities. But in terms of private adoption, we were pleasantly surprised to see smaller countries like Israel and Singapore are taking a big lead. They are the crucible of the labs of the world, so to speak.\u201d\nThe United States and China are also power players in the world of AI. Long-term, we know that more data leads to better AI, so the scale of China and the U.S. is going to play out with the amount of data they collect.\nThe U.S. also leads the way in designing algorithms and developing the next wave of AI tech. Because of that innovation, they are able to attract the best talent, which becomes a virtuous cycle for the country.\nWithin the private sector, Germany has a substantial amount of AI-related jobs, especially in SME and manufacturing.\nRecommendations for Unlocking the Potential of AI\nWhen I asked Trung about the policy levers that have the greatest impact for countries, and what nations can do to gain traction in the global AI arms race, he said:\n\u201cOne of the things that I would say is the investments in R&D supports. The U.K., the Americas, and Canada started investing in AI a decade ago, and they\u2019re reaping the benefits of it now. It\u2019s almost business as usual in those countries \u2013 while those that are just emerging will really need to push a lot of the effort into how R&D is funded.\u201d\nFinding the right balance between sharing data and protecting data will also play an important role. If a country has draconian regulations about how data can be used, that can have a negative impact on how much AI will benefit a country \u2013 but privacy protections for data are also important."

In 2023, it produced the highest quality AI research, built the most notable machine learning models, spent the most in private investment, and had the most AI merger/acquisition activity. The country also boasted the highest number of AI job postings and newly funded AI startups. \n## China in Second, But Falling Behind\nIn recent years, there has been much focus on how the U.S. compares to China in AI. This tool indicates that while the two superpowers used to be competitors, the U.S. is quickly pulling away. On several key indicators, the U.S. outpaces China: In 2023, it attracted more AI-related private investment (US$67.2 billion vs. US$7.8 billion), and produced more notable machine learning models (61 vs. 15). However, China leads in AI patenting, having produced more AI-related patents than the U.S. \n## Nations Across the World Increasingly Prioritizing AI\nThe Global Vibrancy Tool illustrates how AI has increasingly become a political priority for various nations and how this focus can improve a country\u2019s AI vibrancy. For example, in recent years, the United Arab Emirates has publicly committed to becoming a global leader in AI, investing heavily in quality research institutes like the Technology Innovation Institute. According to the Global Vibrancy Tool, the UAE this year ranked fifth."

        "literature_writeup": "# Determinants of Success in the Global AI Arms Race\n\n## Technological Innovation as the Core Driver of Competitiveness\n\nTechnological innovation functions as the foundation of national competitiveness in the global AI arms race by enabling a country to achieve superiority in AI capabilities that contribute to economic power, defense readiness, and geopolitical influence. Leading nations such as the United States and China have placed technological innovation at the center of their national strategies, channeling significant investments toward research and development (R&D), algorithmic advancement, and data utilization to secure a commanding position in AI innovation and application[1][2].  \n\nContinual innovation allows these countries to accelerate the creation of new AI technologies and integrate them into critical industrial processes, increasing economic efficiency and facilitating the emergence of cutting-edge industries that further enhance overall competitiveness[3]. China\u2019s national AI strategy explicitly designates technological innovation as the principal driver of its transition toward economic modernization and aims for global AI leadership by 2030, emphasizing development in smart manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and financial technology[3][1]. The iterative nature of AI research\u2014where each breakthrough informs the next\u2014makes technological progress both cumulative and exponential. Advances in closely related sectors, notably semiconductors, play a decisive role in maintaining sustained AI leadership[4].\n\n## The Interdependence of Innovation and Talent\n\nTechnological innovation and human capital are mutually reinforcing factors. Nations that achieve technological breakthroughs tend to attract and cultivate highly skilled talent, which is essential for sustaining momentum in AI research and development[4][5]. Educational institutions, government programs, and incentive structures that nurture AI expertise serve as multipliers in this competitive cycle. In turn, a deep talent pool supports further innovation by generating new knowledge and responding rapidly to emerging technological opportunities. This interplay produces a self-sustaining cycle: innovation draws talent; talent drives further innovation; and the resulting advances enhance national competitiveness and influence[1][4][5].\n\n## Policy and Institutional Support for Innovation\n\nGovernment policies and institutional frameworks critically shape the success of technological innovation in the global AI arms race. Policy choices regarding R&D investment, technology regulation, and data governance determine the speed and scope of AI progress[1]. Governments that foster stable and well-funded R&D ecosystems while maintaining a balanced approach to data access and privacy protections create favorable conditions for sustained innovation. Such policy environments not only enable efficient knowledge creation but also reduce barriers to collaboration among industry, academia, and government units, all of which are crucial for producing globally competitive AI technologies[1].\n\nFurthermore, innovation influences policy design itself. As nations advance in AI, they often adapt legal and regulatory systems to either encourage or constrain technological growth. Countries demonstrating agility in responding to new ethical, security, and economic challenges associated with AI gain additional competitive advantages by enabling faster deployment and commercialization of innovations.\n\n## Innovation and Geopolitical Power\n\nThe relationship between technological innovation and geopolitical dynamics is symbiotic. Nations invest heavily in AI innovation not merely to achieve economic gain but to secure strategic advantages in national defense and security[4][6]. Cutting-edge AI technologies directly influence the development of autonomous and semi-autonomous weapon systems, which alter both the speed and conduct of modern warfare. In this context, nations that sustain innovation leadership extend their influence beyond economic domains into the broader realm of geopolitical strategy and defense competitiveness[6].  \n\nThe integration of AI into defense systems magnifies the returns of technological innovation, as superior algorithms and faster computing translate into enhanced surveillance, decision-making, and operational capabilities. The resulting military advantages further drive national commitments to innovation, creating a feedback loop between technological development and national security imperatives.\n\n## Cycles of Innovation and Competitive Continuity\n\nTechnological innovation not only leads national AI development but also determines the tempo at which a nation can sustain long-term competitiveness. Leadership in innovation fuels a \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d in which improved AI technologies attract greater investment, expand talent recruitment opportunities, and reinforce broader economic and strategic dominance[1][4][5]. Conversely, countries that fail to innovate lose momentum, becoming dependent on foreign technologies and diminishing their influence in global markets and international diplomacy[3][5].  \n\nInnovation thus operates as both the catalyst and the sustaining force of global AI competition. The countries that master this dynamic\u2014through continuous investment, institutional support, and strategic talent cultivation\u2014position themselves to command the future trajectory of AI development and reap its economic, military, and political rewards[1][4][3][6][5].",
        "report": "## Quick Answer\n\nTechnological innovation is the decisive factor in determining a nation's competitiveness in the global AI arms race, as it enables advancements in AI capacities, attracts talent and investment, strengthens economies, enhances defense capabilities, and extends geopolitical influence.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe global AI arms race reflects the strategic pursuit of dominance in artificial intelligence as a core driver of national power. Innovation fuels competitive advantage by advancing algorithms, hardware, and data systems that underpin AI capabilities. Nations at the forefront, such as the United States and China, leverage strong R&D ecosystems and innovation-driven policies to sharpen their technological edge. Innovation also attracts human capital and investment, translating into enhanced economic performance, productivity, and defense preparedness. Sustained advancement in AI innovation thus determines a nation\u2019s long-term geopolitical strength and economic resilience in an increasingly AI-defined world order.\n\n# Technological Innovation Determines National Competitiveness in the Global AI Arms Race\n\n## Introduction: The Global AI Arms Race\nThe global AI arms race represents a transformative contest among nations to achieve superiority in artificial intelligence research, development, and deployment. AI has become central to national power, influencing economic performance, security capabilities, and international influence. In this high-stakes competition, technological innovation serves as the foundation that determines a nation\u2019s position within the global hierarchy of power[1][2].\n\n## Defining Technological Innovation in AI\nIn the context of AI, technological innovation refers to the creation and implementation of new algorithms, advancements in computing hardware, and the ability to efficiently utilize vast amounts of data. Innovation encompasses breakthroughs that enable faster training of AI models, improved machine learning accuracy, and the ability to apply AI systems across industries and defense applications[1][4].\n\n## Innovation as the Engine of AI Advancement\nInnovation catalyzes AI development by accelerating the creation of new technologies and applications. Major players such as the United States and China invest heavily in R&D to achieve dominance, resulting in iterative advancements that enhance their AI systems\u2019 sophistication. These innovations extend into sectors like smart manufacturing, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and financial technology, solidifying their economic and technological influence[3][1].\n\nMoreover, semiconductor innovation\u2014a crucial enabler of AI computing performance\u2014marks a critical milestone in maintaining leadership in advanced AI research and deployment. Continuous progress in core AI technologies defines how efficiently a nation can transform innovation into competitive output[4].\n\n## Innovation, Talent, and Economic Competitiveness\nTechnological innovation drives a virtuous cycle of talent attraction, investment, and industry growth. Nations fostering innovation-friendly environments\u2014through education, research institutions, and policy incentives\u2014draw the world\u2019s top AI experts, who, in turn, contribute to accelerated technological progress. Governments that maintain stable R&D support and effective data governance policies enhance their ability to sustain innovation ecosystems[1][4][5].\n\nInnovation directly correlates with national productivity and industry creation. By introducing new AI-driven sectors and improving efficiency across existing industries, countries strengthen economic performance and generate new markets. For instance, China\u2019s AI strategy heavily emphasizes innovation to fuel economic transformation and establish global AI leadership by 2030[3][1].\n\n## Defense and Military Applications of AI Innovation\nTechnological innovation in AI also reshapes military strategy and capability. Advanced AI technologies contribute to the development of autonomous or semi-autonomous weapon systems, dynamic defense networks, and predictive threat analysis. These innovations allow for rapid operational decisions, increasing both the speed and complexity of modern warfare. Therefore, innovation is not merely an economic driver but also a decisive factor in defense competitiveness and national security[4][6].\n\n## Geopolitical Influence Through AI Innovation\nBeyond military and economic dimensions, AI innovation enhances geopolitical influence. Nations leading in technological breakthroughs set global standards, attract international partnerships, and shape ethical norms governing AI use. This capacity to influence global trends solidifies strategic power and establishes a dominant voice in international policymaking. A strong innovation base thus becomes both a symbol and instrument of geopolitical authority[4][6][5].\n\n## Sustained Innovation as the Determinant of Competitiveness\nTechnological innovation defines not only a nation\u2019s immediate capabilities but also its long-term trajectory in the AI arms race. Countries that invest heavily in R&D, education, and infrastructure enter a self-reinforcing cycle\u2014innovation attracts talent and capital, which then accelerates further innovation and increases national power. Conversely, nations that lag in innovation face technological dependency, diminished influence, and reduced competitiveness in global AI development[3][5].\n\nIn essence, innovation determines the speed, scope, and sustainability of national AI progress. It underpins economic expansion, fortifies defense capabilities, and amplifies a nation\u2019s global influence. Within the global AI arms race, sustained technological innovation is thus the ultimate determinant of national competitiveness[1][4][3][6][5].\n\n## Bibliography\n[0]. https://bernardmarr.com/the-new-global-ai-arms-race-how-nations-must-compete-on-artificial-intelligence/\n[1]. https://www.adlittle.com/en/insights/prism/global-ai-arms-race-how-nations-can-avoid-being-left-behind\n[2]. https://trendsresearch.org/insight/ai-rivalries-redefining-global-power-dynamics/?srsltid=AfmBOooeM9l5MWxalXCM9bdzZsUNjG1qEaRVR9MzCGAqlb6aJl1zT_r3\n[3]. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14650045.2025.2456019\n[4]. https://worldfinancialreview.com/navigating-the-global-ai-race-how-nations-are-competing-for-technological-supremacy/\n[5]. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10618639/",

Governments and regulators play a critical role in fostering, or hindering, how technology benefits accrue for their citizens, and the role of academia and research institutes is also crucial for AI technology to develop. In this article we look at the successes and failures of national AI strategies, and identify some key priorities for competing nations, including the role of government as well as private and public stakeholders.\n### Which are the current leading countries in AI?\nThere are several country rankings of AI strength across the world. Those that focus on metrics such as patents and research publications tend to list China first, followed by the US, with third place disputed between European and Asian countries including South Korea, Japan and India."

              "AI is critical not only to the defense of countries but also to their economic growth. According to studies, AI is poised to contribute greatly to bolstering a developed nation\u2019s economy. Countries that harness AI\u2019s potential to process and analyze vast amounts of data can revolutionize their national industries, enhance decision-making on a policy level, and stimulate innovation. Beyond optimizing existing economic systems, AI enables nations to create entirely new markets and industries, strengthening their economic resilience and boosting their global competitiveness. Thus, in an era where economic power rivals military strength as a measure of geopolitical influence, AI has become the cornerstone of national strategies. It is the force transforming countries into leaders of a new geopolitical order, reshaping the balance of power in ways the world is only beginning to grasp.\nThis transformative power of AI, however, is also intensifying and fueling a new wave of geopolitical rivalries. Recognizing the transformative potential of AI in achieving economic advantage, military strength and influence over global norms and standards, states are now engaged in a fervent race to outpace each other and lead in AI\u2019s development and application. In their pursuit of supremacy, nations are enhancing their technical prowess while simultaneously altering global power structures, inciting conflicts and alliances that will shape the future of international relations. As the competition for AI leadership continues, it pushes geopolitical rivalries to new heights where the stakes extend far beyond technology itself.\nThe U.S.-China Rivalry: A Case Study in AI Competition",
              "The U.S.-China rivalry is perhaps the clearest example of how AI is intensifying global competition and how it\u2019s emerging as a critical battleground in global geopolitics. Recognizing that AI is not merely an innovation but a strategic necessity that has the potential to reshape state power, enhance military strength, and ensure economic dominance, both China and the U.S. have been competing fiercely to lead in the field of AI and adopt it within their systems. They have both channeled vast amounts of resources into AI\u2019s development, vying for dominance in ways that impact multiple domains.\nWith AI emerging as a transformative force in the global economy, both China and the U.S. are racing to leverage its potential for driving economic growth, revolutionizing industries, and solidifying long-term economic supremacy. China in particular has made technological innovation central to its economic ambitions, doubling its efforts in AI as its competition with the U.S. intensifies. In 2017, through its Next Generation AI Development Plan, the Chinese Communist Party declared AI a cornerstone of its economic transformation strategy, aiming to position AI as a fundamental catalyst for economic change by 2025 and establish China as the global leader in AI by 2030 to challenge and surpass the U.S.\nTo achieve these ambitious goals, China has made rapid advancements and significant investments in its AI capabilities. It invested heavily in research, development, and infrastructure to support AI-driven industries. The government has prioritized sectors such as smart manufacturing, autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and financial technology, viewing them as key drivers of economic growth and global influence. With such ambitions and investments, China is determined to stay ahead in the global race and challenge its rival for leadership."

              "China, the United States, and the European Union have spoken of a global competition surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI). There is widespread talk of an \u2018AI Arms Race\u2019. But what is the nature of this race? We argue that the arms race metaphor does not capture the dynamics of global competition in the AI sector. Instead, we propose the notion of a \u2018geopolitical innovation race\u2019 for technological leadership in a networked global economy. Based on an analysis of government documents, we find that actors (1) are open to both zero-sum and positive-sum approaches in AI development, (2) organise actor networks differently based on national innovation cultures, (3) prioritise economics and status next to security concerns, and (4) are open to how AI should be interpreted. Referring to the competitive race of AI research and development, the three technopoles perpetuate the geopoliticisation of innovation and intertwine security and economic interests.",
              ". At the same time, considering the temporal development of a race, competition implies acceleration and that \u2018over time the relative military advantages disappear\u2019 (Asaro , 49). Further, it is pointed out that \u2018perceptions of a \u201crace\u201d to field AI systems competitors do could cause nations to \u2019 (Scharre ; emph. added). In sum, in an innovation race, companies strive for innovation and the expected pay-offs of a technological breakthrough shape the incentives to these companies \u2013 the larger the payoff, the fiercer the race. To this end, companies collaborate with outside researchers and other companies to maximise their chances. States support these endeavours through economic policies and research funding. In contrast, in an arms race there is continuous competition and investment, with actors envisioning (relative) advantages and seeing no scenario of possible collaboration (Asaro ). With regard to AI innovation, it is indicated that there are instances of collaboration across technopoles and over time. However, we find that positive-sum scenarios are rare as innovation is envisioned to be radical and thus beneficial to actors\u2019 own positioning through gaining relative advantages. Similar to other digital technology (Baur ), AI innovation takes place in a geopoliticised landscape, in which positive-sum scenarios are rare. There is a mix of competition and collaboration: Platform companies from the US and China dominate this market due to their unprecedented access to data, computing power, capital, and engineering talent (Lee ; Miailhe ). At the same time, the iterative nature of AI R&D over the course of decades as well as cooperation between innovative actors across nations (OECD ) indicates that the race \u2013 or rather actors\u2019 perception of it \u2013 does not necessitate leading to ever-escalating, accelerating interactions.",
              "A geopolitical innovation race has various possible outcomes, including negative- or zero-sum games, which can be typically associated with an arms race. These scenarios are indicated by notions of aggressive competition or the erosion of military advantages (Asaro ), taking place in a highly dynamic environment, with the \u2018speed and scale of the change required [being] daunting\u2019 (US DoD Department of Defense , 17). This implies a problematic rationale, in which competition is accelerated at the expense of purposeful, more ethically aligned technology development. This is also supported by references to envisioned civilian AI applications, supposed to be delivered at scale to generate relative advantages over competitors (US DoD , 2). In this regard, talent (\u2018the number one resource\u2019 (PRC MoE People\u2019s Republic of China Ministry of Education , 3)), patents and research output become measurable capacities which have an impact on technopoles\u2019 performance in the AI race (PRC MoE , 4; CISTP (China Institute for Science and Technology Policy at Tsinghua University) , 7\u20138). Relative gains thinking, with comparisons like \u2018nearly double our closest competitor\u2019 (OSTP The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , 8), while referring to rankings among state actors precludes the emergence of positive-sum scenarios, reflecting dynamics of an arms race (Asaro ). This is particularly apparent considering actor networks\u2019 notion on being the first, thereby expecting the most beneficial positioning in competition (Denicol\u00f2 and Franzoni ). For example, the \u2018first year of mass production\u2019 (215) of semi-conductors is stated to be \u2018critical to overall U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence\u2019 (NSCAI National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence , 213) while, in , it is seen as useful to \u2018(i)mplement incentive policies, such as reducing the risk of investing in the first units of major equipment\u2019 (State Council , 34)."

              "Another significant hurdle is the shortage of AI talent. Countries are competing for the brightest minds, and those who succeed in nurturing and attracting the best talent will likely have an advantage. This is why education systems are adapting to include more AI-related courses, and governments are offering incentives for students to pursue AI careers.\nThe economic implications of the AI race are vast. As automation becomes more prevalent, job markets will shift, and some industries may decline as others boom. Nations that lead in AI development stand to gain significantly from the economic growth it promises, but those who lag may face job displacement and reduced competitiveness.\nThe geopolitical landscape is also being reshaped by the AI race. Control over AI technology could lead to new forms of power and influence, potentially leading to a new Cold War-like scenario. Military applications of AI, such as autonomous weapons, raise concerns about an arms race and the potential for misuse.\nWhile the AI race is predominantly framed as a competition, there is also room for collaboration. Shared challenges like climate change, health pandemics, and cyber threats can be better addressed through international cooperation. Pooling resources and knowledge can lead to faster progress and more comprehensive solutions. For instance, international collaborations in AI research could lead to breakthroughs in medicine and environmental science.\nHowever, the current trend seems to be leaning towards competition, with nations seeking to protect their AI technologies from others. The has spilled over into the tech sector, with restrictions on technology transfer impacting companies and research collaborations.\n## The Future of the AI Race"

              "In pursuit of global domination or a relative improvement in their status, major powers including the USA, China, Russia, India, and the European Union (EU) have been seen to be ramping up their investments on AI research and development (R&D) to arrive at major breakthroughs. Several scholars argue that these nation-states are engaged in a \u2018global AI race\u2019 to utilise the technology to boost their economic productivity as well as military effectiveness to get ahead of the rest ( ; ; ; ). On the commercial front, AI can trigger largescale unemployment as well as enable the rise of new commercial technology giants. On the flipside, AI is said to have the ability to equip a country with formidable economic power by boosting its economic productivity ( ; ). The potential for competition to achieve a technological breakthrough in AI is particularly said to manifest as an accelerated arms race that will create instability at national and international levels. This is because AI, like any other novel advances in technology can potentially facilitate newer forms and modes of warfare entailing highly advanced offensive and defensive capabilities wielded by the warring nation-states ( ; [International Committee of the Red Cross, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10618639/#ref100)). Increased integration of autonomous or semi-autonomous weaponry is further expected to increase the speed of warfare. In a projection for a worst-case scenario, AI and its contribution to reducing the human cost of war can possibly incentivise nation-states to engage in them frequently."

        "literature_writeup": "# Global Leadership in AI Capabilities\n\n## AI Research Quality and Publication Impact\n\n### Publication Volume and Growth\nChina currently holds the global lead in AI publication volume, producing approximately 281,650 articles between 1998 and 2022, demonstrating sustained and rapid growth alongside India in research output [1]. More recently, China surpassed the EU27 in annual AI publications, approaching nearly 60,000 papers in 2023 and accounting for around 18% of the global share of AI-related research [2]. By contrast, the United States\u2014though showing signs of stabilization in growth\u2014remains a dominant force, having produced over 772,000 AI-related papers, which represent about 30% of the global total over the last decade [2].\n\nIndia\u2019s trajectory also reflects notable expansion, with a strong increase in contribution to global AI research output and substantial gains when research productivity is evaluated against national resources [1]. Collectively, these figures establish China, the United States, and India as the largest contributors to global AI research by volume, underscoring their ongoing prominence in shaping academic and technological directions within the field.\n\n### Research Quality and Impact\nWhen research quality is considered separately from quantity, several smaller but research-intensive economies\u2014particularly Hong Kong, Singapore, and Switzerland\u2014emerge as global leaders. Metrics such as citations per publication and the field-weighted citation impact (FWCI) highlight these regions\u2019 performance over the last decade [1]. Publications from Hong Kong and Singapore frequently appear within the global top 1%, 5%, and 10% citation percentiles, while Switzerland consistently ranks among the highest for citations per paper and FWCI, signifying sustained excellence and international influence in AI scholarship [1]. \n\nHigh FWCI and top-tier publication shares often correlate with economic and innovation impacts. In alignment with these measures, the United States, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Switzerland exhibit strong economic effects derived from scholarly output, reflected in the number of AI-related patent citations linked to their academic research [1]. These linkages emphasize that smaller, research-intensive countries can translate scientific impact efficiently into applied technologies and intellectual property advantages.\n\n### Efficiency-Adjusted Output\nWhen research productivity is normalized by population size and economic scale, new leaders emerge. Singapore, with approximately 250 AI publications per million inhabitants, leads globally on a per capita basis, while India produces 7.7 AI publications per billion GDP, showcasing exceptional research efficiency given its resource base [1]. Moreover, India leads in output efficiency when normalized to the number of researchers and to gross expenditures on research and development (GERD), indicating a robust ability to achieve high levels of AI research output with comparatively limited expenditure and workforce [1].\n\nThis efficiency-oriented analysis complements the volume-based perspective by highlighting the effectiveness of AI research ecosystems among countries with differing scales of resources and institutional maturity. Such metrics are particularly valuable for assessing the sustainability and scalability of national AI strategies in the evolving global research landscape.\n\n### Thematic and Disciplinary Distinctions\nDistinct national research patterns further reveal specialization within AI subfields. Chinese researchers have demonstrated strong concentration in robotics and computer vision, consistent with the country\u2019s industrial emphasis on autonomous systems and manufacturing technologies [3]. In contrast, U.S. researchers maintain a comparative advantage in natural language processing (NLP), reflecting synergies with its software and large-language-model ecosystems, as well as a significantly higher proportion of publications devoted to AI safety\u2014a smaller but strategically critical subdomain in global discussions of responsible AI [3].\n\nThese differences underscore how national research ecosystems align with broader economic and strategic priorities. Countries\u2019 thematic emphases in AI research often mirror their market structures, policy frameworks, and national innovation missions, contributing to differentiated roles and comparative advantages within the international AI research landscape.\n\n### Structural Determinants of Research Leadership\nUnderlying these disparities in AI research impact and focus are several systemic drivers. Talent quality, intellectual property protection, research funding mechanisms, computational infrastructure, and access to high-quality datasets constitute foundational enablers of research performance and innovation [1][2][3]. Additionally, coherent national AI strategies\u2014integrating academic and industrial ecosystems\u2014have bolstered the ability of leading countries to sustain competitiveness in both research output and research-to-commercialization pathways [1][2].\n\nIn aggregate, while China, the United States, and India dominate global AI publication volume, the research ecosystems of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Switzerland demonstrate how smaller nations can achieve global recognition through excellence in quality and efficiency. This diverse set of strengths highlights multiple pathways to AI leadership: scale-based dominance through volume and infrastructure on one hand, and precision-based leadership driven by innovation intensity and research quality on the other [1][2][3].",
        "report": "## Quick Answer\n\nWhile China and the United States dominate global AI research in quantity, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Switzerland excel in quality, producing highly cited, field-leading publications and demonstrating exceptional research efficiency driven by strategic focus and strong international collaborations.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nGlobal AI research is still largely defined by the immense publication volumes of China and the United States, which together produce nearly half of all AI-related studies worldwide. Yet, when research impact is measured by citation quality and field-weighted performance, smaller nations like Hong Kong, Singapore, and Switzerland outperform. These high-performing hubs achieve top rankings in citations per paper and concentration of publications in elite journals. Their success is attributed to strategic investments, international networks, and research cultures prioritizing excellence over volume. These models showcase how targeted national strategies and collaboration ecosystems can yield outsized global influence, offering lessons for major AI powers focused on scaling impact rather than sheer output.\n\n# Small Nations, Big Impact: How Hong Kong, Singapore, and Switzerland Outshine AI Giants\n\n## Global AI Research Dominance\n\nArtificial intelligence has become a global research frontier, with countries like China and the United States leading in publication volume. Between 1998 and 2022, China produced roughly 281,650 AI-related articles, experiencing rapid growth alongside India [1]. In 2023, China overtook the EU27 in annual publication output, reaching nearly 60,000 papers and capturing around 18% of global AI research share [2]. Meanwhile, the United States, with an estimated 772,000 papers produced over the last decade, retains about 30% of global output despite a plateau in growth [2].\n\nThese data underscore the dominance of large nations in AI research *volume*\u2014a key indicator of capacity and investment. Yet, the quality and impact of research tell a more nuanced story, revealing that quantity alone does not equate to influence or innovation.\n\n## Measuring Research Quality: Beyond Volume\n\nAssessing AI research quality requires focusing on factors like citations per publication and field-weighted citation impact (FWCI), which measure how often research is referenced relative to global standards in the same field. High impact scores indicate that work not only contributes knowledge but also shapes the direction of global research.\n\nUnder these measures, smaller regions\u2014particularly Hong Kong, Singapore, and Switzerland\u2014emerge as powerhouses of research quality. These economies consistently outperform larger countries in producing publications within the top 1%, 5%, and 10% most-cited journals globally [1]. Switzerland leads in citations per publication and FWCI, reflecting both the quality and international relevance of its research [1]. \n\n## Hong Kong, Singapore, and Switzerland: High-Impact Case Studies\n\n### Hong Kong\nDespite its size, Hong Kong has established itself as a regional AI hub known for research influence far exceeding its publication volume. Leading universities such as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and the Chinese University of Hong Kong are recognized for their output in computer vision and robotics, fields closely aligned with industrial innovation and start-up ecosystems [1]. The high concentration of top-tier journal publications demonstrates a research culture centered on depth and originality.\n\n### Singapore\nSingapore\u2019s strategic emphasis on AI is evident in its national vision for digital transformation and innovation. The city-state\u2019s research ecosystem produces approximately 250 AI papers per million residents, an impressive figure given its modest population [1]. Its research institutions\u2014such as the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University\u2014benefit from robust government funding, industry collaboration, and global partnerships that bridge academic and commercial innovation [1]. The country\u2019s strong showing in both publication output normalized by GDP and citations indicates exceptional research efficiency.\n\n### Switzerland\nSwitzerland distinguishes itself through excellence in quality metrics, leading in both citations per publication and FWCI [1]. Its academic institutions, notably ETH Zurich and EPFL, maintain deep international collaborations and prioritize scientific rigor and reproducibility. Swiss AI research contributes substantially to high-impact domains and correlates strongly with patent citations, suggesting that academic output feeds directly into technological innovation [1]. This synergy between academia and industry is reinforced by a stable research funding environment and international openness.\n\n## Efficiency and Comparative Impact\n\nWhen accounting for population and economic scale, Singapore and India both show strong performance in AI research productivity, though Singapore\u2019s citation advantage underscores its unique efficiency [1]. India achieves high normalized outputs relative to research expenditure, pointing to emerging capacity, yet smaller innovation-oriented systems like Singapore\u2019s and Switzerland\u2019s show how targeted investments achieve greater research influence per resource spent.\n\n## Thematic Distinctions in Global AI Research\n\nPatterns in thematic specialization reveal that China focuses heavily on robotics and computer vision, while the United States holds a comparative edge in natural language processing (NLP) and AI safety research [3]. Meanwhile, smaller economies such as Hong Kong and Singapore leverage their strengths in these same applied research areas to enhance collaboration with industry and global research networks, reinforcing their international visibility [1][3].\n\n## Lessons from Small Nations\n\nThe experiences of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Switzerland illustrate that strategic focus, talent cultivation, and global collaboration can produce outsized influence in AI research. By emphasizing quality over quantity, aligning academic agendas with innovation ecosystems, and maintaining strong international linkages, these smaller nations demonstrate pathways to research leadership that transcend scale. Their success offers valuable lessons for larger countries: that impactful AI ecosystems arise not merely from size, but from the deliberate design of environments that reward excellence, innovation, and collaboration.\n\n## Bibliography\n[0]. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2024/1689353\n[1]. https://www.digital-science.com/blog/2024/01/research-on-artificial-intelligence-the-global-divides/\n[2]. https://eto.tech/blog/state-of-global-ai-research/",

              "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly expanding field. Given the dynamic nature of AI research, staying up-to-date with this evolving landscape is imperative to guide the global race in this field. Using the world\u2019s largest bibliometric database (SciVal/Scopus), we analyzed the research output of the top 15 countries in AI research productivity between the years 1998 and 2022. Over the past 25 years, the global research output in AI has increased by 26 folds, with China leading the way in the overall number of AI publications (281,650 articles). During this period, China and India had the highest fold growth (~240\u2013250) and compound annual growth rate (CAGR) (~25). However, when normalized to population size and gross domestic product (GDP), Singapore (250 AI publications per million capita) and India (7.7 AI publications per billion GDP) were the best performers in 2022, respectively. When normalized to the number of researchers and gross expenditures on research and development (GERD), again, India was the best with 36.8 AI publications per thousand researchers and 0.77 AI publications per million GERD in 2020. When the overall quality of AI publications over the past decade was considered, Hong Kong and Singapore performed the best with respect to publications in higher percentile journals (the top 1%, 5%, and 10% journals), and Switzerland performed the best with respect to citations/publication and field-weighted citation impact (FWCI). Finally, when the quality measures of publications were normalized to country or research metrics, the three best performers were Hong Kong, Singapore, and Switzerland (although India stood out for citations/GERD). These three countries (along with the United States) also had the highest economic impact as measured by the patent citations per scholarly output, which was aligned with the high FWCI values for these countries",
              "In summary, the data shows that all 15 countries have had an increase in AI research output over the last 25 years, although to different extents, with 90% of these scholarly outputs published from these 15 countries, in any given year. While China, India, and the United States have the highest number of AI research articles during these years, India and China have had a more rapid growth in AI scholarly output. There are several plausible reasons for the remarkable growth in AI research productivity in these countries. These include increased attention to AI scholarly activity and scientific research, increased number of programs and institutes focusing on AI, and increased funding opportunities for scientific research in the field of AI.\nOverall, some countries have better performance than others in AI research because of the number and quality of talents, the serious programs for intellectual property protection, the funds spent on research and development, the technology infrastructure from massive computational resources to the availability of huge databases, the relaxed ethical and privacy concerns, and the national strategies set by the governments for improving AI research and its applications in various government and private sectors. For the countries that wish to further improve their research in AI, they need to update their national policies and strategies to boost the levels of funds in this field, offer data availability that can help scientists develop their ML models, provide access to supercomputing powers, incentivize the talent creation and retention in their country, and create and update the ethical guidelines related to AI.\n###  3.4. AI Research Publications Normalized to Country Metrics",
              "Compared to the number of citations, citations/publication is a better way to measure the quality of publications as it factors out the differences in the quantity (i.e., the number of scholarly output). On average across the last decade, Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Singapore have performed the best with respect to citations/publication (Table 3(b)). The relatively lower values of citations/publication in China and the United States indicate that the high citations observed in Table 3(a) are primarily a result of quantity (i.e., higher numbers of publications as depicted in Figure ) and not quality.\nAs another measure of quality, FWCI, which standardizes citation frequencies to each field of research, was used. FWCI had similar patterns to those observed for the citations/publication (Table 3(b)) and the publications in top percentile journals (Figure ). On average across the last decade, Switzerland, Singapore, and Hong Kong, followed by Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom had the highest FWCI (Table 3(c)). It is also important to point out that across the past decade, all countries (except Japan, China, and India) have a higher citation/publication and/or higher FWCI than the world\u2019s average.\nIn summary, in this section, we compared the quality (publications in top percentile journals, citations, citations per publication, and FWCI) of AI publications. Most of the 15 selected countries have increased their publication share in higher-ranking journals, although their share in the top 1% and 5% journals remains modest. Singapore and Hong Kong performed the best in this measure of quality. On another note, the United States and China had the highest number of citations over the last 10 years, which is likely a reflection of their high number of AI publications.

              "The EU27 published over 30,000 AI papers annually in the early time period, leading global output. However, China has since surpassed the EU27, rapidly rising from around 13,000 papers in 2012 to become the leading publisher with nearly 60,000 in 2023. The US which started in second position follows in third now, though its publication volume has levelled off in recent years after its initial first ranking. India has experienced major growth, with over 17,000 AI papers in 2023 compared to under 4,000 a decade prior; it even overtook the UK, which started in fourth position. Canada, Australia, Japan, Russia and South Korea maintain top 10 presence, though their year-to-year output has declined mildly in the most recent years.\nThe data shows emerging economies like China, India and others gaining ground in AI research, reflected by their rapidly growing publication output over the past decade. Though traditional leaders in North America and Europe continue to produce high volumes, developing countries are claiming more seats at the table and diffusing expertise globally. There is still an advantage skewed towards wealthy regions. But the statistics indicate dividing lines blurring as the playing field levels to some extent, allowing more nations to drive progress based on their own interests without barriers previously faced. Whilst gaps remain in scale and infrastructure, the global AI research landscape exhibits increased participation beyond just an exclusive Western bloc.\n### Balance university vs company research\nWe have used the Global Research Identifier Database (GRID \u2013 a database of educational and research organisations worldwide) typology to understand the distribution of AI publications between public and private research institutions from 2012-2023. GRID distinguishes organisations into categories like Archive, Company, Education, Facility, Government, Healthcare, Nonprofit, and Other.",
              "There are stark global divides in artificial intelligence (AI) research and development, with both publications and grants heavily concentrated in a few advanced countries over the past decade. The landscape of AI papers is dominated by the US and China, which have produced around 50% of all publications. A similar pattern emerges in AI grants, with the US and China also providing the most funding annually. A handful of other developed nations like the UK, Germany, and Japan have established strongholds in both metrics, collectively accounting for another substantial portion of global research outputs and total grants. However, the vast majority of the developing world \u2013 encompassing most countries across Africa, South America, and Asia \u2013 contributes under 5% in both metrics, significantly lagging in critical resources for progressing AI research.\nWhile China has rapidly grown to lead AI publications, surpassing the EU, it still trails second behind the US in terms of number of AI grants funded. Emerging economies like India and Brazil are making consistent gains increasing research participation and grants provided. But their output and funding levels are still below AI research leaders. The data highlights how a handful of advanced Western countries and China continue to vastly outpace most other nations in both key AI research metrics. Though divides show some signs of blurring, deep funding and infrastructure disparities persist globally.\nExperts from across the pharmaceutical and biotechnology landscape share trends, challenges, and opportunities for using AI in drug discovery \nA panel of experts explores publication success, new measures of impact, and how digital transformation and AI are reshaping the\u2026 \nDiscover SRAD, Digital Science\u2019s new program launched in July 2025, designed to streamline research analytics, offer real\u2011time data insights, and\u2026 \nHow do we know if Open Access research is having its intended impact?",
              "## Distribution of AI research publications\nFigure 1: Cartogram made online using _based on data from Dimensions.ai for 2012-2023._\nThis striking cartogram Figure 1 visualises the global landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) research from 2014-2023 based on academic publication outputs from countries around the world. The contours of each landmass depict the number of peer-reviewed papers contributed over the decade across core AI subfields spanning machine learning to computational mathematics.\nMirroring the data, the US dominates the cartogram with a swollen territorial outline reflecting its pole position \u2013 American institutes produced over 772,000 papers, accounting for a huge 30% share globally. China remains a major leader at approximately 465,000 papers or 18% share.\nBeyond the two giants, moderately sized outlines mark the UK, Germany, Japan and others like India, Brazil and Iran \u2013 highlighting established AI research strongholds churning out 10,000 to 140,000 papers each over the period. Meanwhile Africa, South America and most Asian nations appear paltry, indicating largely untapped AI potential with less than a 5% collective contribution.\nWhile North America, East Asia and select countries in Europe and Oceania show depth, the visual makes the divide across the Global South stark \u2013 over 80% of the world\u2019s population reside here but with little access to resources critical to unlocking AI capabilities seen elsewhere. Addressing these deep disparities should be a top priority for transitioning towards more equitable and inclusive AI development globally.\nTo understand the extent of the global divide in the last 12 years, we analysed the trends in the top 10 countries that published AI research, based on Dimensions\u2019 data for 2012-2023. \nFigure 2: Trend in AI research publications in the countries with the top 10 biggest outputs"
