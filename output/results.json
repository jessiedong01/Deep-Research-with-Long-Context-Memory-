Evidence from global and domestic UBI pilots demonstrates that unconditional cash transfers can reduce poverty and enhance financial security without discouraging labor participation or triggering inflation. However, the fiscal cost of a national UBI program\u2014estimated in the trillions annually\u2014renders large-scale implementation currently infeasible.  \n\nUltimately, this report concludes that while UBI offers compelling socioeconomic advantages, the United States **should not yet implement a full-scale universal basic income**. Instead, a phased approach emphasizing incremental or targeted cash-transfer mechanisms\u2014such as negative income taxes, child allowances, or pilot expansions\u2014presents a more sustainable path toward achieving UBI\u2019s objectives [node_2][node_3].\n\n---\n\n## Introduction  \n### Definition and Concept  \nUniversal Basic Income (UBI) is defined as a periodic, unconditional cash payment made equally to all individuals, irrespective of employment status or income level. It aims to ensure a baseline of economic security while minimizing bureaucratic inefficiency.\n\n### Background and Policy Context  \nIn the United States, automation, wage stagnation, and income inequality have reignited interest in UBI as a reform to modernize the social safety net. Prior proposals by economists and policymakers suggest UBI could replace fragmented welfare programs and provide consistent income security amid labor-market transitions.\n\n### Purpose and Scope  \nThis report examines whether the United States should implement UBI by integrating economic, fiscal, and policy analyses derived from empirical research and pilot studies.\n\n### Structure of Research  \nThe analysis proceeds in two main segments:\n1. **Economic Impacts:** Employment, inflation, and poverty implications of UBI.  \n2. **Fiscal Challenges:** Funding mechanisms, welfare interactions, and sustainability concerns.\n\n---\n\n## Economic Benefits and Impacts  \n\n### Employment Effects  \nConcerns that UBI discourages work lack empirical support. Evidence from Finland\u2019s national pilot and U.S. city-based experiments (Stockton and Hudson) show that recipients typically maintained or even increased employment levels. Financial stability from guaranteed income enabled participants to transition into better jobs, reduce burnout, and pursue education or caregiving\u2014activities that enhance long-term productivity [node_2].  \n\nUBI\u2019s unconditional nature removes the \u201cbenefit cliff\u201d effects present in traditional welfare, preserving incentives for additional earnings. As a result, UBI fosters greater employment quality rather than undermining participation.\n\n### Inflationary Pressures  \nEconomic models indicate that inflationary risks from UBI depend chiefly on program scale and financing. Empirical evidence from pilot programs shows negligible inflation, as these transfers often replaced other spending rather than injecting entirely new money into circulation [node_2]. Well-designed funding\u2014especially through taxation or resource-based revenue\u2014can curb demand overshoot. Consequently, inflationary fears, while theoretically valid, appear overstated for moderate-scale programs.\n\n### Poverty and Inequality Reduction  \nThe strongest evidence supports UBI\u2019s role in poverty alleviation. Pilot data indicate consistent improvements in food security, debt reduction, and mental well-being. In Stockton, participants reported greater job stability and reduced financial stress, demonstrating UBI\u2019s ability to enhance resilience and opportunity [node_2].  \n\nUnlike means-tested welfare, UBI\u2019s universality eliminates access barriers and stigma, guaranteeing baseline income security for all citizens. In a national rollout, UBI could significantly reduce inequality\u2014though its full effect would depend on payment size and tax progressivity.\n\n---\n\n## Fiscal and Policy Challenges  \n\n### Cost and Funding Mechanisms  \nImplementing a meaningful UBI would entail unprecedented fiscal demands. A $10,000 annual payment per adult would cost roughly **$3.28 trillion per year**, or around **80% of current federal spending**, extending to approximately **$33 trillion over a decade** [node_3]. Even lower-scale programs would necessitate major new revenue sources.\n\nProposed funding mechanisms and their trade-offs include:\n- **Tax-Based Models:** Increased wealth, carbon, or consumption taxes can raise necessary funds but risk efficiency losses and political resistance.  \n- **Program Consolidation:** Reallocating welfare funds provides minimal offset, as most current expenditures already reach beneficiaries.  \n- **Payroll Taxes:** Could provide stable financing but would raise labor costs and potentially suppress employment growth.  \n- **Deficit Financing:** Unsustainable due to debt expansion and risk of crowding out private investment.  \n- **Sovereign Funds:** Inspired by Alaska\u2019s model, but national scalability is limited.\n\n### Relationship to Existing Welfare Programs  \nReplacing targeted welfare with a universal system would constitute a fundamental shift in U.S. social policy. While administrative simplification is appealing, it could **redistribute resources away from the most vulnerable**, undermining equity goals [node_3]. The majority of welfare expenditures directly assist low-income recipients, implying minimal budget savings through consolidation. Thus, a cautious integration or supplemental UBI approach may be preferable.\n\n### Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability  \nNational UBI adoption would significantly reconfigure federal fiscal priorities, with potential trade-offs in healthcare, education, and infrastructure investment [node_3]. Tax-based funding might dampen GDP growth through reduced labor supply, while deficit financing could strain macroeconomic stability. Long-term success would require steady revenue generation, adaptive fiscal policy, and clear political consensus\u2014conditions currently unmet.\n\n---\n\n## Synthesis and Policy Trade-offs  \nThe economic case for UBI is persuasive: it enhances well-being, reduces inequality, and sustains participation in the workforce [node_2]. Yet fiscal realities sharply constrain implementation prospects. The scale of required funding dwarfs existing federal capacities and presents unacceptable risks to long-term budget health [node_3].  \n\nHence, while UBI fulfills critical social objectives, it clashes with feasible fiscal management. Moderate proposals\u2014partial UBI, targeted transfers, or negative income taxes\u2014may balance the trade-off between equity and sustainability. These hybrid models can extend UBI\u2019s benefits while limiting costs.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion and Recommendations  \nBased on current evidence, **the United States should not yet implement a full-scale Universal Basic Income**. Despite demonstrable socioeconomic benefits, fiscal and policy challenges outweigh immediate feasibility.  \n\n**Policy Recommendations:**  \n1. **Incremental Expansion:** Test and scale local or demographic-specific cash transfer programs.  \n2. **Targeted Mechanisms:** Adopt negative income tax schemes or child allowances to achieve similar anti-poverty effects efficiently.  \n3. **Further Research:** Conduct large-scale pilots focusing on fiscal sustainability and welfare integration strategies.  \n\nUBI represents an aspirational policy for equitable prosperity, with strong empirical validation of its social benefits. However, until sustainable funding pathways and systemic integration models emerge, nationwide implementation remains premature [node_2][node_3].\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[1] Is There Empirical Evidence on How the Implementation of a ... - MDPI - https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/22/9459\n[2] Universal basic income - County Health Rankings & Roadmaps - https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/strategies-and-solutions/what-works-for-health/strategies/universal-basic-income\n[3] Does Universal Basic Income Work?

        "The objective of this article is to determine, as conclusively as possible, if the implementation of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) would lead to a significant reduction in the working age population labour supply. If this were true, implementation of a UBI may not be sustainable. To do this, we will compile empirical evidence from studies over the last few decades on the effects of implementation of a UBI on employment. We apply the PRISMA methodology to better judge their validity, which ensures maximum reliability of the results by avoiding biases and making the work reproducible. Given that the methodologies used in these studies are diverse, they are reviewed to contextualize the results taking into account the possible limitations detected in these methodologies. While many authors have been writing about this issue citing experiences or experiments, the added value of this article is that it performs a systematic review following a widely tested scientific methodology. Over 1200 documents that discuss the UBI/employment relationship have been reviewed. We found a total of 50 empirical cases, of which 18 were selected, and 38 studies with contrasted empirical evidence on this relationship. The results speak for themselves: Despite a detailed search, we have not found any evidence of a significant reduction in labour supply. Instead, we found evidence that labour supply increases globally among adults, men and women, young and old, and the existence of some insignificant and functional reductions to the system such as a decrease in workers from the following categories: Children, the elderly, the sick, those with disabilities, women with young children to look after, or young people who continued studying. These reductions do not reduce the overall supply since it is largely offset by increased supply from other members of the community.",
        "Third, the impact on employment. This issue is of critical importance as, if the implementation of UBI results in a significant reduction in labour supply, it would be impossible to finance the initiative. The relationship between UBI and employment is indeed complex, since not only does the impact on the labour supply need to be taken into account, but also the impact on the labour demand, entrepreneurship, productivity, aggregate demand, innovation and the development of technology, the 4th Industrial Revolution, social participation, power-sharing, the capacity to negotiate, security, instability resulting from poverty and excessive inequality, personal autonomy and satisfaction, health and education. All of these can affect not only the quantity and quality of the labour supply, but also the quantity and quality of the labour demand, along with the productivity, the innovation, and competitivity of companies. In this paper, we focus on the labour supply and how this might be affected by the implementation of a UBI.\nWe start with Philippe Van Parijs\u2019 widely accepted definition of UBI, \u201ca Basic Income is an income paid by a political community to all its members on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement\u201d. That is to say, we consider it a periodic cash transfer by the State or corresponding public institution, which is unconditional, universal, individual (not per family), sufficient (at least the minimum required to live), not based on work, taxes or age, long-term or permanent (in principle, for life).",
        "Although UBI has been considered as one of the most appropriate measures to reduce economic poverty and inequality, one of the most frequently referenced disadvantages is the possible negative effect on the labour supply that would make this measure unsustainable. This stems from the widely held idea that the contribution of money to the \u201cpoor\u201d promotes \u201claziness\u201d. This idea, among others, was based on the classical economic theory (Ricardo and Malthus primarily) and later the neoclassical and marginalist theory up to the most complex neo-liberal models, which do not question this assumption.\nWhere does that idea come from? Is there any empirical evidence to support it? The empirical reality underlying all this at the time of the birth of classical economic theory is the experience of Speenhamland in the United Kingdom (1795), which supposedly demonstrated it according to the studies carried out at the time. These studies have subsequently been analysed, showing they had clearly biased diagnoses []. In relation to the neoclassical theory, it does not seem certain that it is forceful in this sense, it rather says that it is possible that this effect occurs in some cases, depending on the combination of income and substitution effects. We investigate the current empirical evidence on this UBI/employment relationship as it is relevant to the sustainability of UBI. Although the important question is how its implementation improves the well-being of the population [], it is necessary to check whether a UBI can be established as a long-term national policy, since, if as some claim, the implementation of a UBI resulted in many people not working, it would make it unfeasible."

        "What does the research say about effectiveness? \nUniversal basic income (UBI) is a suggested strategy to improve individuals\u2019 financial stability and health outcomes. Available evidence suggests that programs with similarities to UBI, such as cash transfer programs or supplemental assistance programs, can have positive, multi-generational effects, based on long-term studies of individuals whose families received these types of supports when they were children. These programs do not appear to significantly reduce labor supply. However, additional evidence is needed to confirm effects, especially of a large-scale UBI program.\nIn theory, universal basic income programs provide a direct cash transfer to individuals unconditionally, universally, and regularly. Some experts interpret basic as covering basic needs without earned income; others argue it refers to a base amount intended to be combined with income from paid work. Many UBI supporters propose $1000 per month as a cash transfer amount that is high enough to cover basic needs. Other supporters suggest starting with $500 or less per month and increasing over time, since even small amounts could be significant for those living in extreme poverty. UBI is different from a tax credit or in-kind benefit, such as for food or housing, and distinct from programs which provide benefits at the household level or which provide a single lump sum, for example in early adulthood. The scale and length of UBI programs also influence outcomes. Whether individuals anticipate a program will be short- or long-term may affect their behavior, especially for employment decisions.",
        "Early research on a small-scale, two-year basic income pilot program in Finland suggests that individuals who receive basic income report fewer health problems, reduced stress, and have similar employment outcomes, compared with those who do not receive basic income. A two-year guaranteed income pilot in Stockton, California, which provided individuals with a $500/month unconditional cash transfer, appears to improve financial stability and participants reported improved physical and mental health. Experts note that politicization can influence and challenge understanding of such programs\u2019 effects: for example, the early cancellation of a Canadian basic income pilot, which was ended due to shifting political support, left participants reporting increased financial precarity and negative feelings toward the government, but unable to report on how the program impacted them when it was active.\nAdvocates for UBI suggest it could reduce poverty and increase economic stability; improve population health, especially through reduced stress and stress-related behaviors; increase involvement in activities like caregiving, education, and entrepreneurship; protect workers who may be displaced by automation; and be simpler to administer than existing safety net programs. Some experts suggest UBI benefits could reduce the negative economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research focused on the long-term, psychological, and political effects of a universal component is needed. Available evidence on targeted cash transfer programs suggests that eligible individuals fail to enroll due to lack of awareness, administrative barriers, or stigma and that such programs can have unintended effects for non-beneficiaries; experts suggest that universal programs would alleviate these challenges.",

        "Hausman () adds that the introduction of UBI might lead to an increase in current marginal tax rates to fund it, generating negative substitution effects. This could encourage individuals to reduce their work efforts, compromising overall economic productivity and creating a substantial budget deficit, making the UBI program unsustainable. Given the government's tight budget constraints, potential work disincentives may trigger public concerns about misallocating limited fiscal resources to an ostensibly unproductive scheme, suggesting a redirection toward targeted income support programs. This scenario could hinder UBI from gaining public support, as seen in the 2016 basic income referendum in Switzerland.\nOn the contrary, proponents argue that providing UBI does not necessarily lead to reduced labor supply (Gilroy et al., ; Imbens et al., ; Marx & Peeters, ; Pasma, ; Sommer, ; Van Parijs, ). They suggest that unlike selective social benefits that discourage work due to concerns about losing benefits when earnings increase, UBI may mitigate this outcome. Low-income individuals can retain their benefits even after their earnings increase. Gamel et al. () and Marx and Peeters () further argue that basic income motivates low-income earners to invest more in education or job training, enhancing their prospects for stable employment due to the financial security provided by UBI. Additionally, Gilroy et al. () propose that diligent workers often have a higher propensity to spend, as increased earnings allow them to afford desired purchases. Moreover, the rise in relative consumption costs due to higher taxes could counteract the notion of reduced work hours due to UBI.",
        "Additionally, individual circumstances, such as income or labor market dynamics, further complicate predictions. First, there are differing views on the impact of UBI on the labor supply behavior of low-income individuals. For instance, Calnitsky () argues that UBI may help individuals overcome barriers to better jobs and empower them to reject insecure or low-paying work, as UBI could strengthen workers' negotiating power by providing an alternative income source without work requirements. Particularly, the jobs chosen by low-income individuals often do not require special training or certifications, giving them a wider range of options. Therefore, when a certain level of income is guaranteed that allows them to maintain a basic standard of living, their negotiation power with employers increases, providing them with the incentive to seek better and more stable employment (Pech, ; Widerquist et al., ). On the contrary, Gray () emphasizes that UBI could maintain poor work conditions and low pay, acting as a subsidy for employers by enabling them to reduce wages and weakening workers' bargaining positions. This could result in more people being hired into exploitative, low-paid jobs. The impact of UBI on work incentives for high-income earners is influenced by participation and marginal effective tax rates, which measure how much of their earnings are lost to taxes or reduced benefits (Martinelli, ). High participation and marginal effective tax rates can reduce financial motivation to work more, especially for high-income earners. If a significant portion of additional income is lost to taxes or reduced benefits, the incentive to increase work effort diminishes, potentially leading to a decrease in overall labor supply. This issue is particularly relevant in the context of UBI, where the design of the tax and benefit system will play a crucial role in determining its impact on work incentives",
        "The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, contributing to an inevitable decrease in job opportunities, has elevated UBI as a crucial topic for discussion. The 2022 presidential election in South Korea has ignited a comprehensive debate about UBI, covering its effects on labor supply, administrative efficiency, financial feasibility, tax increases, and income distribution effects. Among these, concerns about potential negative effects on labor supply carry significant weight. Addressing worries that UBI could discourage recipients from seeking employment poses a major challenge for UBI proponents, hindering its political feasibility. In Switzerland, not a single political party supported the UBI proposal, with the Federal Council advising voters to reject it, citing the risk of a reduced workforce willing to engage in paid work (Foulkes, ; Gesley, ). Similarly, the Basic Income experiment in Finland, intended to gauge whether UBI encourages job seeking among the unemployed, yielded minimal differences between the experiment and control groups in terms of work incentives, resulting in waning political support (Nagesh, ).\nNumerous theoretical and empirical studies have explored UBI's impact on labor supply, yet a consensus has yet to emerge. Different UBI experiments, such as full basic income, partial basic income, and negative income tax (NIT), conducted in various countries, have produced divergent outcomes. As a result, labor supply effects may depend on UBI type, payment amount, and socioeconomic context. Therefore, the empirical question should focus on whether specific UBI models, under certain conditions, increase negative effects on labor supply, rather than whether the general model of UBI inherently does so. In this regard, the significance of this study lies in its effort to simulate labor supply responses to income changes induced by particular UBI models in the South Korean context.\n###  What is universal basic income?"

        "Some UBI proponents respond that policymakers could make the UBI payments taxable. But the savings from doing so would be relatively modest, because the vast bulk of Americans either owe no federal income tax or are in the 10% or 15% tax brackets. For example, if you gave all 328 million Americans a $10,000 UBI and the cost was $3.28 trillion a year (about $33 trillion over ten years) taxes, then making the UBI payments taxable would reduce that cost only to something like $2.5 trillion or $2.75 trillion (or $25 trillion to $27.5 trillion over ten years).\nWhere would the money to finance such a large expenditure come from? That it would come mainly or entirely from new taxes isn\u2019t plausible. We\u2019ll already need substantial new revenues in the coming decades to help keep Social Security and Medicare solvent and avoid large benefit cuts in them. We\u2019ll need further tax increases to help repair a crumbling infrastructure that will otherwise impede economic growth. And if we want to create more opportunity and reduce racial and other barriers and inequities, we\u2019ll also need to raise new revenues to invest more in areas like pre-school education, child care, college affordability, and revitalizing segregated inner-city communities.\nA UBI that\u2019s financed primarily by tax increases would require the American people to accept a level of taxation that vastly exceeds anything in U.S. history. It\u2019s hard to imagine that such a UBI would advance very far, especially given the tax increases we\u2019ll already need for Social Security, Medicare, infrastructure, and other needs.",
        "UBI\u2019s daunting financing challenges raise fundamental questions about its political feasibility, both now and in coming decades. Proponents often speak of an emerging left-right coalition to support it. But consider what UBI\u2019s supporters on the right advocate. They generally propose UBI as a for the current \u201cwelfare state.\u201d That is, they would finance UBI by eliminating all or most programs for people with low or modest incomes. \nConsider what that would mean. If you take the dollars targeted on people in the bottom fifth or two-fifths of the population and convert them to universal payments to people all the way up the income scale, you\u2019re redistributing income . That would increase poverty and inequality rather than reduce them.\nYet that\u2019s the platform on which the (limited) support for UBI on the right largely rests. It entails abolishing programs from SNAP (food stamps) \u2014 which largely eliminated the severe child malnutrition found in parts of the Southern \u201cblack belt\u201d and Appalachia in the late 1960s \u2014 to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Section 8 rental vouchers, Medicaid, Head Start, child care assistance, and many others. These programs lift tens of millions of people, including millions of children, out of poverty each year and make tens of millions more less poor.\nSome UBI proponents may argue that by ending current programs, we\u2019d reap large administrative savings that we could convert into UBI payments. But that\u2019s mistaken. For the major means-tested programs \u2014 SNAP, Medicaid, the EITC, housing vouchers, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and school meals \u2014 administrative costs consume only 1 to 9 percent of program resources, as a CBPP analysis explains. Their funding goes overwhelmingly to boost the incomes and purchasing power of low-income families."

        "Proposed UBI financial mechanisms depend on the underlying objectives for the program. Some UBI proponents view the benefit as a replacement for some or all existing social transfers, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and housing assistance, other targeted federal spending (e.g., agricultural subsidies), and the tax expenditures such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). These proposals suggest that a UBI could be financed in large part by forgone costs of such programs. Some have suggested, however, that new taxes may be needed to cover full UBI program costs.\nOthers view a UBI as a mechanism for distributing income generated from a state-owned resource. For example, the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend provides an annual payment to eligible Alaskan residents generated from an investment fund seeded by Alaskan oil sales; the annual dividend was $1,100 in 2017. Some Native American tribes similarly distribute a share of profits generated from tribe-owned casinos to tribe members. \nUBI programs have been proposed to address a wide range of social issues. Some frame a UBI as an efficiency-improving replacement for the current body of social insurance and welfare programs in the United States. Such a UBI, it is argued, could potentially reduce administrative costs and application burden for recipients, give more freedom to households over how they allocate funds, and encourage households to establish stronger community ties or otherwise establish nongovernmental support systems.",
        "Charles Murray, _In Our Hands: A Plan to Replace the Welfare State_ (Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute, 2016); and Andy Stern, _Raising the Floor: How a Universal Basic Income Can Renew our Economy and Rebuild the American Dream_\nProgram costs and the related potential for new taxes are among the central concerns expressed about proposed UBI schemes. Two proposals published in 2016 (see \nOther critiques focus on the potential for a UBI to create work disincentives. The labor supply effects of a proposed UBI generally would depend on the benefit amount and other program factors, and its overarching effects on the labor market (e.g., how it affects labor dynamism, private investment in training and education). However, the limited body of related research on universal dividends (e.g., Alaska) and the negative income tax experiments conducted in the 1960s and 1970s do not find large declines in labor force participation. \nUBI critics also raise questions about the replacement of targeted government support with the UBI benefit. They express concern about the fate of households that suffer large financial losses, for example, due to serious illness or catastrophic weather events, and whether the general public has sufficient financial skills to protect against job loss, poor investment outcomes, and other risks. Some proponents acknowledge the need for complementary policies\u2014for example, to improve financial skills and to deter those who would scheme to separate vulnerable recipients from their payments. \nOthers have raised concerns about the possibility of rising prices (i.e., due to increased consumption and upward pressure on wages), and potential future political pressures to increase the benefit amount (beyond inflation), raise taxes, or reinstate discontinued transfer programs.\n_Emma Sifre provided research support for this In_"

        "Despite the United States being one of the wealthiest nations in the world, 12.9% of Americans live in poverty according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure (Shirder and Bijou, 2024). Among this 12.9%, poverty disproportionately affects women and people of color, leading to higher mortality rates within these demographics (Carbonaro, 2023). In addition to poverty, income inequality is a defining feature of the United States economy. $50 trillion has been taken from the bottom 90% of Americans and transferred to the top 1% and the wages of citizens in the top 1% are skyrocketing at rates higher than GDP growth (Hanauer, 2020). When income inequality is high, people experiencing poverty become trapped and upward mobility is limited. In an attempt to decrease poverty and income inequality, many governments\u2014locally, nationally, and internationally\u2014consider tax credit and basic income programs as possible solutions. \nBasic income programs fall under two main categories: (1) universal basic income (UBI) and (2) means-tested basic income. Universal basic income is a government program that provides everyone with a guaranteed cash payment, regardless of income or employment status. On the other hand, a means-tested basic income only provides payment to individuals who meet specific criteria related to financial status, and government benefits are reduced as recipients earn outside income. In order to fund an income program, the federal government would have to increase existing taxes (income, corporate, and excise taxes) or propose a wealth tax (\u201cWhat Options Would Increase Federal Revenues?\u201d, 2024). Aside from funding, there are several aspects policymakers take into consideration when trying to determine if a government policy will be beneficial."

        "Many UBI supporters are liberals, like former Labor Secretary Robert Reich and ex-SEIU head Andy Stern.. Support for a government-supplied income stream has been endorsed by several prominent figures on the right as well. \nAmong them is the late conservative economist Milton Friedman, who suggested that private charitable contributions aren\u2019t enough to alleviate the financial strain many Americans endure. \nIn 1962\u2019s Capitalism and Freedom\", he argued that a \u201cnegative income tax\u201d\u2014essentially a UBI\u2014would help overcome a mindset where citizens aren\u2019t inclined to make sacrifices if they don\u2019t believe others will follow suit. \u201c[W]e might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did,\u201d he wrote. \nLibertarian philosopher Charles Murray believes that guaranteed income would also cut government bureaucracy. He has proposed a $10,000-per-year UBI, as well as basic health insurance, which he says would allow the government to cut and other redistribution programs. \n##  Critiques and Concerns Regarding Universal Basic Income \nDespite its promise to curtail poverty and cut red tape, universal basic income still faces an uphill battle. Perhaps the most glaring downside is cost. According to the nonprofit Tax Foundation, Andrew Yang\u2019s $1,000-a-month Freedom Dividend for every adult would have cost $2.8 trillion each year (minus any offsets from the consolidation of other programs). \nYang proposed covering that substantial expense, in part, by shrinking the size of other social programs and imposing a 10% on businesses. He also proposed ending the cap on Social Security payroll taxes and putting in place a tax on carbon emissions that would contribute to his guaranteed income plan.",
        "Universal Basic Income (UBI) suggests providing all adult citizens with regular government payments, regardless of their financial or employment status, to alleviate poverty and support their basic needs. Although these proposals have emerged intermittently across U.S. cities, they remain largely experimental. The ongoing discourse around UBI continues to gain momentum, fueled by economic shifts attributed to automation and artificial intelligence. Proponents argue that UBI can address these challenges and offer a safety net, while critics focus on its potential costs and effects on employment incentives.

        "## Implementing a Large-Scale UBI Program\nThere are many ways to implement a large-scale UBI program similar in size to the one considered by the Roosevelt Institute. PWBM considers three options that cover a wide range of financing options:\n  * Deficit Financed: $6,000 per year (fixed over time) is given to each adult (defined as age 15 and over), for a total cost of $1.5 trillion annually, which is deficit financed. This approach, therefore, adds to the national debt which reduces private capital service formation over time.\n  * Payroll Tax Financed: $6,000 per year is given to each adult, for a total cost of $1.5 trillion annually, which is financed by an 11.25 percent payroll tax. This approach, therefore, distorts household labor supply decisions by increasing marginal tax rates.\n  * Externally Financed: $6,000 per year is given to each adult, for a total cost of $1.5 trillion annually that is 100-percent financed by external resources. While this Alaskan-type financing is likely implausible at a national scale over a long period of time, we include it as a point of comparison.",
        "Alternatively, a payroll tax could be used to finance this UBI program, as shown by selecting the \u201cPayroll Tax Financed\u201d option in the drop down menu in Table 1. By 2027, federal outlays rise 40.6 percent, relative to current policy. However, because the UBI is financed by a payroll tax, debt is fairly stable and private capital services mainly fall due to households reducing their hours worked by 3.2 percent. GDP falls 1.7 percent, and Social Security revenues drop by 2.4 percent. By 2032, the effects are similar to those in 2027 since debt is not increasing over time.\nWhen \u201cExternally Financed\u201d is selected from the drop down menu in Table 1, the modeled federal outlays are assumed to not change since the UBI transfers are made directly from an Alaskan-type of external fund to households. Nonetheless, by 2027, households feel richer and reduce their hours work by 5.8 percent, which, in turn, reduces household saving for capital services by 3.1 percent and GDP by 3.4. Total revenues fall by 6.1 percent and Social Security revenues fall by 4.5 percent. Fairly similar numbers emerge by the year 2032.\nAt first glance, it appears surprising that GDP falls by more with \u201cExternally Financed\u201d than with a distorting payroll tax. As we explain in more detail in a , the reason stems from the fact that the Externally Financed option produces relatively larger income effects, leading to less labor income and GDP. Households are relatively better off with external financing since it allows them to enjoy more consumption and leisure. The external financing case re-emphasizes the fact that GDP is not always a good measure of household welfare.\nWe estimate three ways to finance a Universal Basic Income program: with deficits, a payroll tax and with transfers funded by external sources. Under all three scenarios, a Universal Basic Income program dampens hours worked, capital services, GDP and Social Security revenues.",
        "A Universal Basic Income program would provide a guaranteed income for each American, but it would substantially lower GDP, regardless of how the program is financed.\n# Options for Universal Basic Income: Dynamic Modeling\nUniversal Basic Income (UBI) is a proposed program where most people in a country would receive a regular and equal cash transfer, typically monthly. Unlike regular welfare programs, qualification for UBI and the amount received would not depend on earnings or employment of the recipient.\nSo far, there appears to be very little support for UBI among economists, including among traditionally more liberal economists ( and ) and among more traditionally conservative economists (). Nonetheless, public support for UBI appears to be growing over time. A found that of Americans support a UBI program to help Americans who lose their jobs due to automation. Moreover, experiments with UBI programs are underway in , and . The State of Alaska has run a since 1982 to distribute proceeds from rights to mineral extractions.\nImplementing a UBI program at the national level would be expensive. In 2015, shows that total federal spending was . So, before taking dynamic effects on economic growth into account, implementing an annual $1.5 trillion dollar UBI---approximately the cost of giving every adult $6,000 per year---would ramp up spending levels by over 40 percent. Barring new revenue sources, deficits would be [more than three times larger](https://usafacts.org/government-finances/spending?comparison=by_government_type&government_type=combined&table=spending--by-mission&year=2015) than the actual 2015 level."

        "report": "# Report: Should the United States Implement Universal Basic Income (UBI)?\n\n## Introduction  \nUniversal Basic Income (UBI) \u2014 a periodic, unconditional cash payment to all citizens \u2014 has re-emerged as a potential policy reform for addressing rising inequality, automation-driven job displacement, and poverty. While empirical evidence indicates substantial social and economic benefits, practical considerations around fiscal feasibility and systemic integration present major obstacles. This report synthesizes findings from analyses of UBI\u2019s economic effects and its fiscal and policy challenges to assess whether the U.S. should adopt such a program.\n\n---\n\n## Economic Benefits and Impacts  \n\n### Employment  \nEvidence from pilot studies in Finland and U.S. programs such as Stockton and Hudson demonstrates that UBI does not significantly reduce employment levels and may even foster transitions toward more stable or desirable jobs. Participants commonly used the guaranteed payments to enhance job mobility, pursue education, and reduce financial stress \u2014 all factors contributing to long-term labor productivity [Child 1]. Minimal reductions in employment appeared only among groups like caregivers and students, whose decreased work hours reflected investments in family care or education. Therefore, rather than diminishing work incentives, UBI appears to improve employment quality and individual autonomy.  \n\n### Inflation  \nWhile theoretical models suggest that large-scale cash transfers can raise aggregate demand and risk inflation, empirical studies from UBI pilots indicate that moderate, well-funded programs have negligible inflationary effects. Inflation risk depends on program financing and economic capacity; tax-funded or reallocation-based UBI structures could mitigate demand shocks [Child 1]. When paired with prudent fiscal management, UBI is unlikely to cause runaway inflation.  \n\n### Poverty and Inequality  \nThe most consistent and robust outcome across pilot programs is poverty reduction. Recipients report easier access to necessities, reduced debt, and greater capacity to plan and invest in long-term goals. By providing a basic income floor, UBI addresses income insecurity directly and without the stigma or administrative barriers of targeted welfare [Child 1]. Nationally implemented, UBI could substantially lower poverty rates and expand economic resilience across demographics.  \n\n---\n\n## Fiscal and Policy Challenges  \n\n### Cost and Funding  \nThe largest barrier to UBI adoption is its extraordinary cost. A $10,000 annual UBI per adult would total approximately $3.28 trillion\u2014approaching 80% of total federal spending\u2014and around $33 trillion over a decade [Child 2]. Even lower-payment programs would require substantial new revenue or major reallocation of federal resources.  \n\nProposed funding sources include higher income or wealth taxes, carbon or consumption taxes, payroll taxes, and deficit financing. Each presents trade-offs:  \n- **Tax-based models** risk weakening economic efficiency and face political resistance.  \n- **Program consolidation** could simplify welfare administration but undermine aid to vulnerable populations reliant on targeted support.  \n- **Payroll taxes** may strain labor markets by raising effective labor costs.  \n- **Deficit financing** could exacerbate national debt and crowd out private investment.  \n- **Sovereign fund models**, similar to Alaska\u2019s, lack scalability at a national level [Child 2].  \n\n### Interaction with Existing Welfare Programs  \nReplacing or consolidating existing welfare systems to fund UBI would represent a radical transformation. While simplification may appeal administratively, eliminating need-based programs could harm the lowest-income groups by redistributing resources away from those most dependent on targeted aid [Child 2]. Current welfare programs already channel most funds directly to beneficiaries, offering limited savings potential through consolidation. Thus, broad substitution with UBI could jeopardize the social safety net rather than strengthen it.\n\n### Long-Term Policy Considerations  \nFunding and sustainability challenges could also alter federal fiscal priorities. High-cost universal transfers may crowd out public investments in healthcare, education, and infrastructure [Child 2]. Without a clear funding model or offsetting productivity growth, long-term fiscal sustainability remains uncertain.\n\n---\n\n## Synthesis: Balancing Benefits and Challenges  \n\nThe economic evidence underscores UBI\u2019s capacity to improve financial security, mental well-being, and poverty outcomes with limited negative side effects on labor participation or inflation [Child 1]. However, the fiscal and policy analyses reveal overwhelming challenges in financing such a program sustainably without drastic tax increases or extensive restructuring of existing welfare frameworks [Child 2].  \n\nUBI\u2019s promise as a tool for economic empowerment is tempered by its scale of required funding and the potential disruption to existing support systems. While pilot studies show localized success, national implementation would demand a level of fiscal transformation and political will that currently appears unattainable.  \n\n---\n\n## Conclusion  \n\nBased on current evidence, **the U.S. should not yet implement a full-scale universal basic income**, given the immense fiscal burden and structural disruptions it would entail. However, the promising economic outcomes suggest that **incremental or targeted forms of basic income**, such as negative income tax models, child allowances, or periodic cash transfers to vulnerable groups, could serve as viable steps toward the broader objectives of UBI.  \n\nUBI remains an economically beneficial but fiscally constrained aspiration: its success in improving well-being and reducing poverty is clear, but without sustainable funding mechanisms, nationwide implementation would risk economic strain and policy instability [Child 1][Child 2].",

              "The objective of this article is to determine, as conclusively as possible, if the implementation of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) would lead to a significant reduction in the working age population labour supply. If this were true, implementation of a UBI may not be sustainable. To do this, we will compile empirical evidence from studies over the last few decades on the effects of implementation of a UBI on employment. We apply the PRISMA methodology to better judge their validity, which ensures maximum reliability of the results by avoiding biases and making the work reproducible. Given that the methodologies used in these studies are diverse, they are reviewed to contextualize the results taking into account the possible limitations detected in these methodologies. While many authors have been writing about this issue citing experiences or experiments, the added value of this article is that it performs a systematic review following a widely tested scientific methodology. Over 1200 documents that discuss the UBI/employment relationship have been reviewed. We found a total of 50 empirical cases, of which 18 were selected, and 38 studies with contrasted empirical evidence on this relationship. The results speak for themselves: Despite a detailed search, we have not found any evidence of a significant reduction in labour supply. Instead, we found evidence that labour supply increases globally among adults, men and women, young and old, and the existence of some insignificant and functional reductions to the system such as a decrease in workers from the following categories: Children, the elderly, the sick, those with disabilities, women with young children to look after, or young people who continued studying. These reductions do not reduce the overall supply since it is largely offset by increased supply from other members of the community.",
              "Third, the impact on employment. This issue is of critical importance as, if the implementation of UBI results in a significant reduction in labour supply, it would be impossible to finance the initiative. The relationship between UBI and employment is indeed complex, since not only does the impact on the labour supply need to be taken into account, but also the impact on the labour demand, entrepreneurship, productivity, aggregate demand, innovation and the development of technology, the 4th Industrial Revolution, social participation, power-sharing, the capacity to negotiate, security, instability resulting from poverty and excessive inequality, personal autonomy and satisfaction, health and education. All of these can affect not only the quantity and quality of the labour supply, but also the quantity and quality of the labour demand, along with the productivity, the innovation, and competitivity of companies. In this paper, we focus on the labour supply and how this might be affected by the implementation of a UBI.\nWe start with Philippe Van Parijs\u2019 widely accepted definition of UBI, \u201ca Basic Income is an income paid by a political community to all its members on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement\u201d. That is to say, we consider it a periodic cash transfer by the State or corresponding public institution, which is unconditional, universal, individual (not per family), sufficient (at least the minimum required to live), not based on work, taxes or age, long-term or permanent (in principle, for life).",
              "Although UBI has been considered as one of the most appropriate measures to reduce economic poverty and inequality, one of the most frequently referenced disadvantages is the possible negative effect on the labour supply that would make this measure unsustainable. This stems from the widely held idea that the contribution of money to the \u201cpoor\u201d promotes \u201claziness\u201d. This idea, among others, was based on the classical economic theory (Ricardo and Malthus primarily) and later the neoclassical and marginalist theory up to the most complex neo-liberal models, which do not question this assumption.\nWhere does that idea come from? Is there any empirical evidence to support it? The empirical reality underlying all this at the time of the birth of classical economic theory is the experience of Speenhamland in the United Kingdom (1795), which supposedly demonstrated it according to the studies carried out at the time. These studies have subsequently been analysed, showing they had clearly biased diagnoses []. In relation to the neoclassical theory, it does not seem certain that it is forceful in this sense, it rather says that it is possible that this effect occurs in some cases, depending on the combination of income and substitution effects. We investigate the current empirical evidence on this UBI/employment relationship as it is relevant to the sustainability of UBI. Although the important question is how its implementation improves the well-being of the population [], it is necessary to check whether a UBI can be established as a long-term national policy, since, if as some claim, the implementation of a UBI resulted in many people not working, it would make it unfeasible."

              "What does the research say about effectiveness? \nUniversal basic income (UBI) is a suggested strategy to improve individuals\u2019 financial stability and health outcomes. Available evidence suggests that programs with similarities to UBI, such as cash transfer programs or supplemental assistance programs, can have positive, multi-generational effects, based on long-term studies of individuals whose families received these types of supports when they were children. These programs do not appear to significantly reduce labor supply. However, additional evidence is needed to confirm effects, especially of a large-scale UBI program.\nIn theory, universal basic income programs provide a direct cash transfer to individuals unconditionally, universally, and regularly. Some experts interpret basic as covering basic needs without earned income; others argue it refers to a base amount intended to be combined with income from paid work. Many UBI supporters propose $1000 per month as a cash transfer amount that is high enough to cover basic needs. Other supporters suggest starting with $500 or less per month and increasing over time, since even small amounts could be significant for those living in extreme poverty. UBI is different from a tax credit or in-kind benefit, such as for food or housing, and distinct from programs which provide benefits at the household level or which provide a single lump sum, for example in early adulthood. The scale and length of UBI programs also influence outcomes. Whether individuals anticipate a program will be short- or long-term may affect their behavior, especially for employment decisions.",
              "Early research on a small-scale, two-year basic income pilot program in Finland suggests that individuals who receive basic income report fewer health problems, reduced stress, and have similar employment outcomes, compared with those who do not receive basic income. A two-year guaranteed income pilot in Stockton, California, which provided individuals with a $500/month unconditional cash transfer, appears to improve financial stability and participants reported improved physical and mental health. Experts note that politicization can influence and challenge understanding of such programs\u2019 effects: for example, the early cancellation of a Canadian basic income pilot, which was ended due to shifting political support, left participants reporting increased financial precarity and negative feelings toward the government, but unable to report on how the program impacted them when it was active.\nAdvocates for UBI suggest it could reduce poverty and increase economic stability; improve population health, especially through reduced stress and stress-related behaviors; increase involvement in activities like caregiving, education, and entrepreneurship; protect workers who may be displaced by automation; and be simpler to administer than existing safety net programs. Some experts suggest UBI benefits could reduce the negative economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research focused on the long-term, psychological, and political effects of a universal component is needed. Available evidence on targeted cash transfer programs suggests that eligible individuals fail to enroll due to lack of awareness, administrative barriers, or stigma and that such programs can have unintended effects for non-beneficiaries; experts suggest that universal programs would alleviate these challenges.",

              "Hausman () adds that the introduction of UBI might lead to an increase in current marginal tax rates to fund it, generating negative substitution effects. This could encourage individuals to reduce their work efforts, compromising overall economic productivity and creating a substantial budget deficit, making the UBI program unsustainable. Given the government's tight budget constraints, potential work disincentives may trigger public concerns about misallocating limited fiscal resources to an ostensibly unproductive scheme, suggesting a redirection toward targeted income support programs. This scenario could hinder UBI from gaining public support, as seen in the 2016 basic income referendum in Switzerland.\nOn the contrary, proponents argue that providing UBI does not necessarily lead to reduced labor supply (Gilroy et al., ; Imbens et al., ; Marx & Peeters, ; Pasma, ; Sommer, ; Van Parijs, ). They suggest that unlike selective social benefits that discourage work due to concerns about losing benefits when earnings increase, UBI may mitigate this outcome. Low-income individuals can retain their benefits even after their earnings increase. Gamel et al. () and Marx and Peeters () further argue that basic income motivates low-income earners to invest more in education or job training, enhancing their prospects for stable employment due to the financial security provided by UBI. Additionally, Gilroy et al. () propose that diligent workers often have a higher propensity to spend, as increased earnings allow them to afford desired purchases. Moreover, the rise in relative consumption costs due to higher taxes could counteract the notion of reduced work hours due to UBI.",
              "Additionally, individual circumstances, such as income or labor market dynamics, further complicate predictions. First, there are differing views on the impact of UBI on the labor supply behavior of low-income individuals. For instance, Calnitsky () argues that UBI may help individuals overcome barriers to better jobs and empower them to reject insecure or low-paying work, as UBI could strengthen workers' negotiating power by providing an alternative income source without work requirements. Particularly, the jobs chosen by low-income individuals often do not require special training or certifications, giving them a wider range of options. Therefore, when a certain level of income is guaranteed that allows them to maintain a basic standard of living, their negotiation power with employers increases, providing them with the incentive to seek better and more stable employment (Pech, ; Widerquist et al., ). On the contrary, Gray () emphasizes that UBI could maintain poor work conditions and low pay, acting as a subsidy for employers by enabling them to reduce wages and weakening workers' bargaining positions. This could result in more people being hired into exploitative, low-paid jobs. The impact of UBI on work incentives for high-income earners is influenced by participation and marginal effective tax rates, which measure how much of their earnings are lost to taxes or reduced benefits (Martinelli, ). High participation and marginal effective tax rates can reduce financial motivation to work more, especially for high-income earners. If a significant portion of additional income is lost to taxes or reduced benefits, the incentive to increase work effort diminishes, potentially leading to a decrease in overall labor supply. This issue is particularly relevant in the context of UBI, where the design of the tax and benefit system will play a crucial role in determining its impact on work incentives",
              "The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, contributing to an inevitable decrease in job opportunities, has elevated UBI as a crucial topic for discussion. The 2022 presidential election in South Korea has ignited a comprehensive debate about UBI, covering its effects on labor supply, administrative efficiency, financial feasibility, tax increases, and income distribution effects. Among these, concerns about potential negative effects on labor supply carry significant weight. Addressing worries that UBI could discourage recipients from seeking employment poses a major challenge for UBI proponents, hindering its political feasibility. In Switzerland, not a single political party supported the UBI proposal, with the Federal Council advising voters to reject it, citing the risk of a reduced workforce willing to engage in paid work (Foulkes, ; Gesley, ). Similarly, the Basic Income experiment in Finland, intended to gauge whether UBI encourages job seeking among the unemployed, yielded minimal differences between the experiment and control groups in terms of work incentives, resulting in waning political support (Nagesh, ).\nNumerous theoretical and empirical studies have explored UBI's impact on labor supply, yet a consensus has yet to emerge. Different UBI experiments, such as full basic income, partial basic income, and negative income tax (NIT), conducted in various countries, have produced divergent outcomes. As a result, labor supply effects may depend on UBI type, payment amount, and socioeconomic context. Therefore, the empirical question should focus on whether specific UBI models, under certain conditions, increase negative effects on labor supply, rather than whether the general model of UBI inherently does so. In this regard, the significance of this study lies in its effort to simulate labor supply responses to income changes induced by particular UBI models in the South Korean context.\n###  What is universal basic income?"

              "Some UBI proponents respond that policymakers could make the UBI payments taxable. But the savings from doing so would be relatively modest, because the vast bulk of Americans either owe no federal income tax or are in the 10% or 15% tax brackets. For example, if you gave all 328 million Americans a $10,000 UBI and the cost was $3.28 trillion a year (about $33 trillion over ten years) taxes, then making the UBI payments taxable would reduce that cost only to something like $2.5 trillion or $2.75 trillion (or $25 trillion to $27.5 trillion over ten years).\nWhere would the money to finance such a large expenditure come from? That it would come mainly or entirely from new taxes isn\u2019t plausible. We\u2019ll already need substantial new revenues in the coming decades to help keep Social Security and Medicare solvent and avoid large benefit cuts in them. We\u2019ll need further tax increases to help repair a crumbling infrastructure that will otherwise impede economic growth. And if we want to create more opportunity and reduce racial and other barriers and inequities, we\u2019ll also need to raise new revenues to invest more in areas like pre-school education, child care, college affordability, and revitalizing segregated inner-city communities.\nA UBI that\u2019s financed primarily by tax increases would require the American people to accept a level of taxation that vastly exceeds anything in U.S. history. It\u2019s hard to imagine that such a UBI would advance very far, especially given the tax increases we\u2019ll already need for Social Security, Medicare, infrastructure, and other needs.",
              "UBI\u2019s daunting financing challenges raise fundamental questions about its political feasibility, both now and in coming decades. Proponents often speak of an emerging left-right coalition to support it. But consider what UBI\u2019s supporters on the right advocate. They generally propose UBI as a for the current \u201cwelfare state.\u201d That is, they would finance UBI by eliminating all or most programs for people with low or modest incomes. \nConsider what that would mean. If you take the dollars targeted on people in the bottom fifth or two-fifths of the population and convert them to universal payments to people all the way up the income scale, you\u2019re redistributing income . That would increase poverty and inequality rather than reduce them.\nYet that\u2019s the platform on which the (limited) support for UBI on the right largely rests. It entails abolishing programs from SNAP (food stamps) \u2014 which largely eliminated the severe child malnutrition found in parts of the Southern \u201cblack belt\u201d and Appalachia in the late 1960s \u2014 to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Section 8 rental vouchers, Medicaid, Head Start, child care assistance, and many others. These programs lift tens of millions of people, including millions of children, out of poverty each year and make tens of millions more less poor.\nSome UBI proponents may argue that by ending current programs, we\u2019d reap large administrative savings that we could convert into UBI payments. But that\u2019s mistaken. For the major means-tested programs \u2014 SNAP, Medicaid, the EITC, housing vouchers, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and school meals \u2014 administrative costs consume only 1 to 9 percent of program resources, as a CBPP analysis explains. Their funding goes overwhelmingly to boost the incomes and purchasing power of low-income families."

              "Proposed UBI financial mechanisms depend on the underlying objectives for the program. Some UBI proponents view the benefit as a replacement for some or all existing social transfers, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and housing assistance, other targeted federal spending (e.g., agricultural subsidies), and the tax expenditures such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). These proposals suggest that a UBI could be financed in large part by forgone costs of such programs. Some have suggested, however, that new taxes may be needed to cover full UBI program costs.\nOthers view a UBI as a mechanism for distributing income generated from a state-owned resource. For example, the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend provides an annual payment to eligible Alaskan residents generated from an investment fund seeded by Alaskan oil sales; the annual dividend was $1,100 in 2017. Some Native American tribes similarly distribute a share of profits generated from tribe-owned casinos to tribe members. \nUBI programs have been proposed to address a wide range of social issues. Some frame a UBI as an efficiency-improving replacement for the current body of social insurance and welfare programs in the United States. Such a UBI, it is argued, could potentially reduce administrative costs and application burden for recipients, give more freedom to households over how they allocate funds, and encourage households to establish stronger community ties or otherwise establish nongovernmental support systems.",
              "Charles Murray, _In Our Hands: A Plan to Replace the Welfare State_ (Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute, 2016); and Andy Stern, _Raising the Floor: How a Universal Basic Income Can Renew our Economy and Rebuild the American Dream_\nProgram costs and the related potential for new taxes are among the central concerns expressed about proposed UBI schemes. Two proposals published in 2016 (see \nOther critiques focus on the potential for a UBI to create work disincentives. The labor supply effects of a proposed UBI generally would depend on the benefit amount and other program factors, and its overarching effects on the labor market (e.g., how it affects labor dynamism, private investment in training and education). However, the limited body of related research on universal dividends (e.g., Alaska) and the negative income tax experiments conducted in the 1960s and 1970s do not find large declines in labor force participation. \nUBI critics also raise questions about the replacement of targeted government support with the UBI benefit. They express concern about the fate of households that suffer large financial losses, for example, due to serious illness or catastrophic weather events, and whether the general public has sufficient financial skills to protect against job loss, poor investment outcomes, and other risks. Some proponents acknowledge the need for complementary policies\u2014for example, to improve financial skills and to deter those who would scheme to separate vulnerable recipients from their payments. \nOthers have raised concerns about the possibility of rising prices (i.e., due to increased consumption and upward pressure on wages), and potential future political pressures to increase the benefit amount (beyond inflation), raise taxes, or reinstate discontinued transfer programs.\n_Emma Sifre provided research support for this In_"

              "Despite the United States being one of the wealthiest nations in the world, 12.9% of Americans live in poverty according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure (Shirder and Bijou, 2024). Among this 12.9%, poverty disproportionately affects women and people of color, leading to higher mortality rates within these demographics (Carbonaro, 2023). In addition to poverty, income inequality is a defining feature of the United States economy. $50 trillion has been taken from the bottom 90% of Americans and transferred to the top 1% and the wages of citizens in the top 1% are skyrocketing at rates higher than GDP growth (Hanauer, 2020). When income inequality is high, people experiencing poverty become trapped and upward mobility is limited. In an attempt to decrease poverty and income inequality, many governments\u2014locally, nationally, and internationally\u2014consider tax credit and basic income programs as possible solutions. \nBasic income programs fall under two main categories: (1) universal basic income (UBI) and (2) means-tested basic income. Universal basic income is a government program that provides everyone with a guaranteed cash payment, regardless of income or employment status. On the other hand, a means-tested basic income only provides payment to individuals who meet specific criteria related to financial status, and government benefits are reduced as recipients earn outside income. In order to fund an income program, the federal government would have to increase existing taxes (income, corporate, and excise taxes) or propose a wealth tax (\u201cWhat Options Would Increase Federal Revenues?\u201d, 2024). Aside from funding, there are several aspects policymakers take into consideration when trying to determine if a government policy will be beneficial."

              "Many UBI supporters are liberals, like former Labor Secretary Robert Reich and ex-SEIU head Andy Stern.. Support for a government-supplied income stream has been endorsed by several prominent figures on the right as well. \nAmong them is the late conservative economist Milton Friedman, who suggested that private charitable contributions aren\u2019t enough to alleviate the financial strain many Americans endure. \nIn 1962\u2019s Capitalism and Freedom\", he argued that a \u201cnegative income tax\u201d\u2014essentially a UBI\u2014would help overcome a mindset where citizens aren\u2019t inclined to make sacrifices if they don\u2019t believe others will follow suit. \u201c[W]e might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did,\u201d he wrote. \nLibertarian philosopher Charles Murray believes that guaranteed income would also cut government bureaucracy.

Perhaps the most glaring downside is cost. According to the nonprofit Tax Foundation, Andrew Yang\u2019s $1,000-a-month Freedom Dividend for every adult would have cost $2.8 trillion each year (minus any offsets from the consolidation of other programs). \nYang proposed covering that substantial expense, in part, by shrinking the size of other social programs and imposing a 10% on businesses. He also proposed ending the cap on Social Security payroll taxes and putting in place a tax on carbon emissions that would contribute to his guaranteed income plan.",

              "## Implementing a Large-Scale UBI Program\nThere are many ways to implement a large-scale UBI program similar in size to the one considered by the Roosevelt Institute. PWBM considers three options that cover a wide range of financing options:\n  * Deficit Financed: $6,000 per year (fixed over time) is given to each adult (defined as age 15 and over), for a total cost of $1.5 trillion annually, which is deficit financed. This approach, therefore, adds to the national debt which reduces private capital service formation over time.\n  * Payroll Tax Financed: $6,000 per year is given to each adult, for a total cost of $1.5 trillion annually, which is financed by an 11.25 percent payroll tax. This approach, therefore, distorts household labor supply decisions by increasing marginal tax rates.\n  * Externally Financed: $6,000 per year is given to each adult, for a total cost of $1.5 trillion annually that is 100-percent financed by external resources. While this Alaskan-type financing is likely implausible at a national scale over a long period of time, we include it as a point of comparison.",
              "Alternatively, a payroll tax could be used to finance this UBI program, as shown by selecting the \u201cPayroll Tax Financed\u201d option in the drop down menu in Table 1. By 2027, federal outlays rise 40.6 percent, relative to current policy. However, because the UBI is financed by a payroll tax, debt is fairly stable and private capital services mainly fall due to households reducing their hours worked by 3.2 percent. GDP falls 1.7 percent, and Social Security revenues drop by 2.4 percent. By 2032, the effects are similar to those in 2027 since debt is not increasing over time.\nWhen \u201cExternally Financed\u201d is selected from the drop down menu in Table 1, the modeled federal outlays are assumed to not change since the UBI transfers are made directly from an Alaskan-type of external fund to households. Nonetheless, by 2027, households feel richer and reduce their hours work by 5.8 percent, which, in turn, reduces household saving for capital services by 3.1 percent and GDP by 3.4. Total revenues fall by 6.1 percent and Social Security revenues fall by 4.5 percent. Fairly similar numbers emerge by the year 2032.\nAt first glance, it appears surprising that GDP falls by more with \u201cExternally Financed\u201d than with a distorting payroll tax. As we explain in more detail in a , the reason stems from the fact that the Externally Financed option produces relatively larger income effects, leading to less labor income and GDP. Households are relatively better off with external financing since it allows them to enjoy more consumption and leisure. The external financing case re-emphasizes the fact that GDP is not always a good measure of household welfare.\nWe estimate three ways to finance a Universal Basic Income program: with deficits, a payroll tax and with transfers funded by external sources. Under all three scenarios, a Universal Basic Income program dampens hours worked, capital services, GDP and Social Security revenues.",
              "A Universal Basic Income program would provide a guaranteed income for each American, but it would substantially lower GDP, regardless of how the program is financed.\n# Options for Universal Basic Income: Dynamic Modeling\nUniversal Basic Income (UBI) is a proposed program where most people in a country would receive a regular and equal cash transfer, typically monthly. Unlike regular welfare programs, qualification for UBI and the amount received would not depend on earnings or employment of the recipient.\nSo far, there appears to be very little support for UBI among economists, including among traditionally more liberal economists ( and ) and among more traditionally conservative economists (). Nonetheless, public support for UBI appears to be growing over time. A found that of Americans support a UBI program to help Americans who lose their jobs due to automation.

        "literature_writeup": "# Economic Impacts of Universal Basic Income in the United States  \n\n## Employment Effects  \n\nEmpirical evidence from international and regional UBI pilot programs overwhelmingly indicates that the implementation of a universal basic income does not significantly reduce employment levels or the overall labor supply. Systematic reviews across multiple studies report no evidence of a substantial decrease in labor participation following the introduction of unconditional cash transfers. On the contrary, some global findings suggest modest increases in labor supply across diverse demographic groups, including working-age adults and across genders, with only minor reductions observed among specific populations such as students, the elderly, caregivers, or individuals with health impairments. These localized decreases are typically offset by increased participation elsewhere in the labor market, maintaining an overall balance in employment levels [1].\n\nThe Finnish two-year basic income experiment presents a salient case study. Participants who received monthly payments exhibited employment outcomes statistically similar to those of non-recipients. However, recipients reported notable improvements in well-being, including better health and reduced stress, demonstrating that UBI can enhance quality of life without diminishing labor participation [2]. Similarly, in the United States, the Stockton, California guaranteed income pilot, which provided $500 per month unconditionally, found that recipients achieved greater financial stability and were more likely to transition into full-time employment. This outcome suggests that economic security granted by UBI can empower participants to pursue stable and better-paying jobs rather than juggling multiple precarious part-time roles [3].  \n\nThe Hudson, New York pilot mirrors this trend, showing employment rates among participants increasing from 29% to 63%. This finding directly challenges claims that unconditional income support discourages work effort, reinforcing that adequate basic income can facilitate upward mobility rather than dependence [3].  \n\nComprehensive reviews of multiple UBI initiatives reinforce these outcomes by noting that moderate functional reductions in labor supply\u2014such as individuals choosing to invest time in education, skill-building, or caregiving\u2014do not undermine the overall labor market. These forms of labor withdrawal are better understood as reallocations that improve long-term productivity and social well-being [1]. The empirical record thus refutes the stereotype that guaranteed income fosters \u201claziness.\u201d The data instead portray a pattern of enhanced autonomy, improved life balance, and sustained participation in productive activities [1].  \n\nWhile theoretical concerns persist regarding the potential for work disincentives caused by changes in marginal tax rates or the funding mechanisms for UBI, advocates highlight that its universal and unconditional design mitigates these risks. Unlike means-tested welfare programs, UBI does not penalize additional earnings, thereby eliminating benefit traps and preserving incentives to work, learn, and advance economically. This structural feature may also increase workers\u2019 bargaining power, enabling them to negotiate improved working conditions or seek employment that better matches their skills and aspirations [4].  \n\nOpponents sometimes invoke political feasibility concerns tied to perceived workforce reductions, as exemplified by Switzerland's 2016 referendum, where voters rejected a national UBI proposal amid fears of weakened labor motivation [4]. Yet empirical evidence from the Finnish experiment and U.S.-based pilots provides a counterpoint, demonstrating that such reductions are minimal or nonexistent in practice [2][4].  \n\nCollectively, this body of evidence suggests that a universal basic income in the United States would likely sustain stable employment levels while promoting more equitable participation in the labor market. Beyond maintaining work incentives, UBI appears to enhance job quality, economic resilience, and long-term employability by equipping individuals with the security needed to make strategic labor choices aligned with their personal and professional growth [1][2][3][4].",
        "report": "# Report: Economic Effects of a Universal Basic Income in the United States  \n\n## Introduction  \nThe concept of a universal basic income (UBI)\u2014a guaranteed, unconditional cash payment to all citizens\u2014has gained renewed attention in economic policy discussions. Advocates argue that UBI can modernize social safety nets and provide economic resilience in an era of automation and inequality. This report synthesizes evidence from international and U.S.-based pilot programs to summarize how implementing UBI in the United States may influence key economic outcomes: employment, inflation, and poverty rates.  \n\n---\n\n## Employment Effects  \n\n### Mechanisms  \nA central concern regarding UBI implementation is whether guaranteed income discourages work by reducing the financial necessity of employment. Yet, UBI\u2019s unconditional and non-means-tested design eliminates common welfare disincentives such as benefit cliffs, allowing individuals to pursue additional earnings without penalty. This structure theoretically sustains, if not enhances, labor incentives by providing economic stability and flexibility.  \n\n### Empirical Evidence  \nEmpirical findings across global pilot programs consistently demonstrate that UBI does not significantly reduce labor participation. Reviews of multiple experiments report stable employment levels following UBI implementation, dispelling the narrative that unconditional income leads to widespread withdrawal from the labor market [1].  \n\nThe Finnish basic income experiment found no statistically significant difference in employment between recipients and non-recipients, while recipients experienced improved well-being and reduced stress [2]. U.S.-based experiments reinforce these results: the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED) found recipients not only maintained but increased full-time employment, utilizing financial stability to move from precarious to stable jobs [3]. Similarly, Hudson, New York\u2019s program saw employment rates among participants rise dramatically\u2014from 29% to 63%\u2014challenging claims that UBI reduces work effort [3].  \n\nThese findings suggest that moderate decreases in labor activity observed among small subgroups (e.g., caregivers or students) may represent productive reallocations, such as time invested in education or family care\u2014activities that ultimately enhance human capital and economic productivity [1].  \n\n### Policy Considerations  \nA UBI policy could increase bargaining power for workers, allowing them to demand better conditions and salaries without the fear of losing subsistence income. Such dynamics might shift labor market equilibria toward higher job quality rather than reduced participation [4].  \n\n---\n\n## Inflationary Effects  \n\n### Mechanisms  \nA theoretical concern about UBI is that higher disposable income could fuel inflation by boosting aggregate demand. However, inflationary effects depend heavily on how UBI is financed and the economy\u2019s capacity to meet increased demand. If UBI replaces existing welfare spending or is funded through progressive taxation, its net demand effect may be modest. Moreover, gradual program introduction and counter-cyclical fiscal measures could offset inflationary pressures.  \n\n### Empirical Insights  \nEmpirical evidence from pilot programs, such as those in Finland and U.S. municipalities, indicate negligible inflationary effects at local or national levels. Since the funds involved typically redistribute rather than add new money into the economy, aggregate demand shocks are limited. Hence, moderate UBI payments are unlikely to provoke substantial inflation, particularly when accompanied by appropriate fiscal policy and production capacity expansion [1][2][3].  \n\n---\n\n## Poverty and Inequality Reduction  \n\n### Mechanisms  \nBy providing an income floor, UBI directly alleviates poverty and income insecurity. Unlike targeted welfare programs, it ensures inclusivity and reduces administrative complexity, eliminating stigma and bureaucratic barriers to access.  \n\n### Empirical Evidence  \nPilot studies in the U.S. and abroad consistently show UBI improving financial stability and enabling upward mobility. In Stockton, recipients reported greater ability to meet basic needs, pay debts, and plan for future goals [3]. The stability afforded by guaranteed income also empowers individuals to pursue education or invest in small enterprises, multiplying long-term benefits beyond immediate consumption [3].  \n\n### Policy Implications  \nA national UBI could significantly reduce poverty rates in the United States by redistributing wealth and ensuring a baseline income security for all citizens. The degree of impact will depend on payment size, funding mechanisms, and integration with other social programs. Evidence suggests even relatively modest UBI levels lead to reduced financial stress, improved well-being, and higher economic participation across demographics [1][2][3].  \n\n---\n\n## Conclusion  \nThe cumulative evidence indicates that implementing a universal basic income in the United States would likely sustain employment levels, stabilize household finances, and reduce poverty without triggering significant inflation. Far from diminishing work incentives, UBI appears to empower individuals to make strategic employment choices aligned with long-term well-being. Properly calibrated to national fiscal and economic structures, UBI could serve as a transformative policy instrument for promoting economic resilience and inclusive growth [1][2][3][4].",

              "The objective of this article is to determine, as conclusively as possible, if the implementation of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) would lead to a significant reduction in the working age population labour supply. If this were true, implementation of a UBI may not be sustainable. To do this, we will compile empirical evidence from studies over the last few decades on the effects of implementation of a UBI on employment. We apply the PRISMA methodology to better judge their validity, which ensures maximum reliability of the results by avoiding biases and making the work reproducible. Given that the methodologies used in these studies are diverse, they are reviewed to contextualize the results taking into account the possible limitations detected in these methodologies. While many authors have been writing about this issue citing experiences or experiments, the added value of this article is that it performs a systematic review following a widely tested scientific methodology. Over 1200 documents that discuss the UBI/employment relationship have been reviewed. We found a total of 50 empirical cases, of which 18 were selected, and 38 studies with contrasted empirical evidence on this relationship. The results speak for themselves: Despite a detailed search, we have not found any evidence of a significant reduction in labour supply. Instead, we found evidence that labour supply increases globally among adults, men and women, young and old, and the existence of some insignificant and functional reductions to the system such as a decrease in workers from the following categories: Children, the elderly, the sick, those with disabilities, women with young children to look after, or young people who continued studying. These reductions do not reduce the overall supply since it is largely offset by increased supply from other members of the community.",
              "Third, the impact on employment. This issue is of critical importance as, if the implementation of UBI results in a significant reduction in labour supply, it would be impossible to finance the initiative. The relationship between UBI and employment is indeed complex, since not only does the impact on the labour supply need to be taken into account, but also the impact on the labour demand, entrepreneurship, productivity, aggregate demand, innovation and the development of technology, the 4th Industrial Revolution, social participation, power-sharing, the capacity to negotiate, security, instability resulting from poverty and excessive inequality, personal autonomy and satisfaction, health and education. All of these can affect not only the quantity and quality of the labour supply, but also the quantity and quality of the labour demand, along with the productivity, the innovation, and competitivity of companies. In this paper, we focus on the labour supply and how this might be affected by the implementation of a UBI.\nWe start with Philippe Van Parijs\u2019 widely accepted definition of UBI, \u201ca Basic Income is an income paid by a political community to all its members on an individual basis, without means test or work requirement\u201d. That is to say, we consider it a periodic cash transfer by the State or corresponding public institution, which is unconditional, universal, individual (not per family), sufficient (at least the minimum required to live), not based on work, taxes or age, long-term or permanent (in principle, for life).",
              "Although UBI has been considered as one of the most appropriate measures to reduce economic poverty and inequality, one of the most frequently referenced disadvantages is the possible negative effect on the labour supply that would make this measure unsustainable. This stems from the widely held idea that the contribution of money to the \u201cpoor\u201d promotes \u201claziness\u201d. This idea, among others, was based on the classical economic theory (Ricardo and Malthus primarily) and later the neoclassical and marginalist theory up to the most complex neo-liberal models, which do not question this assumption.\nWhere does that idea come from? Is there any empirical evidence to support it? The empirical reality underlying all this at the time of the birth of classical economic theory is the experience of Speenhamland in the United Kingdom (1795), which supposedly demonstrated it according to the studies carried out at the time. These studies have subsequently been analysed, showing they had clearly biased diagnoses []. In relation to the neoclassical theory, it does not seem certain that it is forceful in this sense, it rather says that it is possible that this effect occurs in some cases, depending on the combination of income and substitution effects. We investigate the current empirical evidence on this UBI/employment relationship as it is relevant to the sustainability of UBI. Although the important question is how its implementation improves the well-being of the population [], it is necessary to check whether a UBI can be established as a long-term national policy, since, if as some claim, the implementation of a UBI resulted in many people not working, it would make it unfeasible."

              "What does the research say about effectiveness? \nUniversal basic income (UBI) is a suggested strategy to improve individuals\u2019 financial stability and health outcomes. Available evidence suggests that programs with similarities to UBI, such as cash transfer programs or supplemental assistance programs, can have positive, multi-generational effects, based on long-term studies of individuals whose families received these types of supports when they were children. These programs do not appear to significantly reduce labor supply. However, additional evidence is needed to confirm effects, especially of a large-scale UBI program.\nIn theory, universal basic income programs provide a direct cash transfer to individuals unconditionally, universally, and regularly. Some experts interpret basic as covering basic needs without earned income; others argue it refers to a base amount intended to be combined with income from paid work. Many UBI supporters propose $1000 per month as a cash transfer amount that is high enough to cover basic needs. Other supporters suggest starting with $500 or less per month and increasing over time, since even small amounts could be significant for those living in extreme poverty. UBI is different from a tax credit or in-kind benefit, such as for food or housing, and distinct from programs which provide benefits at the household level or which provide a single lump sum, for example in early adulthood. The scale and length of UBI programs also influence outcomes. Whether individuals anticipate a program will be short- or long-term may affect their behavior, especially for employment decisions.",
              "Early research on a small-scale, two-year basic income pilot program in Finland suggests that individuals who receive basic income report fewer health problems, reduced stress, and have similar employment outcomes, compared with those who do not receive basic income. A two-year guaranteed income pilot in Stockton, California, which provided individuals with a $500/month unconditional cash transfer, appears to improve financial stability and participants reported improved physical and mental health. Experts note that politicization can influence and challenge understanding of such programs\u2019 effects: for example, the early cancellation of a Canadian basic income pilot, which was ended due to shifting political support, left participants reporting increased financial precarity and negative feelings toward the government, but unable to report on how the program impacted them when it was active.\nAdvocates for UBI suggest it could reduce poverty and increase economic stability; improve population health, especially through reduced stress and stress-related behaviors; increase involvement in activities like caregiving, education, and entrepreneurship; protect workers who may be displaced by automation; and be simpler to administer than existing safety net programs. Some experts suggest UBI benefits could reduce the negative economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research focused on the long-term, psychological, and political effects of a universal component is needed. Available evidence on targeted cash transfer programs suggests that eligible individuals fail to enroll due to lack of awareness, administrative barriers, or stigma and that such programs can have unintended effects for non-beneficiaries; experts suggest that universal programs would alleviate these challenges.",

              "Hausman () adds that the introduction of UBI might lead to an increase in current marginal tax rates to fund it, generating negative substitution effects. This could encourage individuals to reduce their work efforts, compromising overall economic productivity and creating a substantial budget deficit, making the UBI program unsustainable. Given the government's tight budget constraints, potential work disincentives may trigger public concerns about misallocating limited fiscal resources to an ostensibly unproductive scheme, suggesting a redirection toward targeted income support programs. This scenario could hinder UBI from gaining public support, as seen in the 2016 basic income referendum in Switzerland.\nOn the contrary, proponents argue that providing UBI does not necessarily lead to reduced labor supply (Gilroy et al., ; Imbens et al., ; Marx & Peeters, ; Pasma, ; Sommer, ; Van Parijs, ). They suggest that unlike selective social benefits that discourage work due to concerns about losing benefits when earnings increase, UBI may mitigate this outcome. Low-income individuals can retain their benefits even after their earnings increase. Gamel et al. () and Marx and Peeters () further argue that basic income motivates low-income earners to invest more in education or job training, enhancing their prospects for stable employment due to the financial security provided by UBI. Additionally, Gilroy et al. () propose that diligent workers often have a higher propensity to spend, as increased earnings allow them to afford desired purchases. Moreover, the rise in relative consumption costs due to higher taxes could counteract the notion of reduced work hours due to UBI.",
              "Additionally, individual circumstances, such as income or labor market dynamics, further complicate predictions. First, there are differing views on the impact of UBI on the labor supply behavior of low-income individuals. For instance, Calnitsky () argues that UBI may help individuals overcome barriers to better jobs and empower them to reject insecure or low-paying work, as UBI could strengthen workers' negotiating power by providing an alternative income source without work requirements. Particularly, the jobs chosen by low-income individuals often do not require special training or certifications, giving them a wider range of options. Therefore, when a certain level of income is guaranteed that allows them to maintain a basic standard of living, their negotiation power with employers increases, providing them with the incentive to seek better and more stable employment (Pech, ; Widerquist et al., ). On the contrary, Gray () emphasizes that UBI could maintain poor work conditions and low pay, acting as a subsidy for employers by enabling them to reduce wages and weakening workers' bargaining positions. This could result in more people being hired into exploitative, low-paid jobs. The impact of UBI on work incentives for high-income earners is influenced by participation and marginal effective tax rates, which measure how much of their earnings are lost to taxes or reduced benefits (Martinelli, ). High participation and marginal effective tax rates can reduce financial motivation to work more, especially for high-income earners. If a significant portion of additional income is lost to taxes or reduced benefits, the incentive to increase work effort diminishes, potentially leading to a decrease in overall labor supply. This issue is particularly relevant in the context of UBI, where the design of the tax and benefit system will play a crucial role in determining its impact on work incentives",
              "The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, contributing to an inevitable decrease in job opportunities, has elevated UBI as a crucial topic for discussion. The 2022 presidential election in South Korea has ignited a comprehensive debate about UBI, covering its effects on labor supply, administrative efficiency, financial feasibility, tax increases, and income distribution effects. Among these, concerns about potential negative effects on labor supply carry significant weight. Addressing worries that UBI could discourage recipients from seeking employment poses a major challenge for UBI proponents, hindering its political feasibility. In Switzerland, not a single political party supported the UBI proposal, with the Federal Council advising voters to reject it, citing the risk of a reduced workforce willing to engage in paid work (Foulkes, ; Gesley, ). Similarly, the Basic Income experiment in Finland, intended to gauge whether UBI encourages job seeking among the unemployed, yielded minimal differences between the experiment and control groups in terms of work incentives, resulting in waning political support (Nagesh, ).\nNumerous theoretical and empirical studies have explored UBI's impact on labor supply, yet a consensus has yet to emerge. Different UBI experiments, such as full basic income, partial basic income, and negative income tax (NIT), conducted in various countries, have produced divergent outcomes. As a result, labor supply effects may depend on UBI type, payment amount, and socioeconomic context. Therefore, the empirical question should focus on whether specific UBI models, under certain conditions, increase negative effects on labor supply, rather than whether the general model of UBI inherently does so. In this regard, the significance of this study lies in its effort to simulate labor supply responses to income changes induced by particular UBI models in the South Korean context.\n###  What is universal basic income?"

        "literature_writeup": "## Fiscal Challenges in Implementing Universal Basic Income  \n\nImplementing a universal basic income (UBI) in the United States presents significant fiscal challenges due to the program\u2019s immense cost and the difficulty of securing a sustainable revenue base without imposing undue burdens on taxpayers or driving up public debt. A UBI plan providing $10,000 annually to every American adult, for example, would cost an estimated $3.28 trillion per year\u2014equivalent to roughly 80% of total federal expenditures\u2014and would accumulate to approximately $33 trillion over a decade[1]. Such costs are far greater than those of existing federal social welfare programs combined.  \n\nFinancing this level of expenditure through new taxes is fiscally and politically daunting, particularly against a backdrop of existing fiscal pressures to maintain Social Security and Medicare solvency, fund infrastructure improvements, and address entrenched racial and economic inequalities[1]. Making UBI payments taxable would only partially offset these costs since many lower-income Americans fall within low or zero tax brackets, resulting in limited federal revenue gains from taxation of the benefit itself[1].  \n\n### Political and Administrative Constraints  \n\nPolitically, achieving the revenue increases necessary for UBI by substantially raising taxes would be unprecedented in scale and controversial due to the competition with other fiscal priorities[1]. Beyond direct costs, the suggestion to consolidate or eliminate existing social welfare programs\u2014such as SNAP, Medicaid, or the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)\u2014to help fund UBI raises concerns of increased poverty and inequality[1][2]. The assumption that replacing these programs would generate significant administrative savings is also questionable, as most expenditures in current programs go directly to beneficiary support rather than administrative overhead[1]. Therefore, fiscal trade-offs extend beyond pure accounting considerations, encompassing deep political and social implications.  \n\n## Proposed Funding Mechanisms for UBI  \n\nA variety of funding mechanisms have been proposed to address these fiscal constraints, each with distinct economic and political trade-offs.  \n\n### Tax-Based Approaches  \n\nRaising existing income, corporate, or excise taxes, or creating new taxes such as on wealth or carbon, are among the most frequently discussed fiscal strategies[3][1][4]. While theoretically capable of generating large revenues, such tax increases carry economic efficiency concerns, risk political backlash, and may have regressive effects depending on tax structure and offsetting measures. The magnitude of tax hikes required to fund a full UBI would exceed historical precedents, making broad congressional approval and public acceptance unlikely[1].  \n\n### Program Consolidation and Expenditure Reallocation  \n\nSome advocates propose partially funding UBI through consolidation of existing social programs and tax expenditures such as the EITC, Section 8 housing vouchers, or SNAP[2][4]. This method would allow some offsetting of costs through reduced direct spending on targeted assistance while simplifying the welfare state. However, this approach invites criticism for potentially eroding the safety net for the most vulnerable groups, as UBI by design does not adjust benefits based on need or cost of living[1]. Furthermore, administrative savings would likely remain minimal, as existing inefficiencies within welfare administration constitute a small fraction of total program costs[1].  \n\n### Payroll Tax Funding  \n\nAnother modeled approach involves dedicated payroll taxation. For instance, financing a modest $6,000 UBI per adult annually could be achieved through an approximate 11.25% payroll tax, resulting in a yearly cost of around $1.5 trillion[5]. While this mechanism could stabilize debt levels, it introduces disincentives for labor participation by effectively raising marginal tax rates on workers[5]. Over time, reduced labor supply could diminish income tax revenues and offset potential economic benefits expected from UBI.  \n\n### Deficit Financing  \n\nDeficit funding, or borrowing to meet UBI outlays, represents an alternative but risky fiscal path. Although politically easier in the short term, sustained borrowing for such an expensive entitlement program would substantially increase the federal deficit. In turn, higher debt levels could crowd out private investment, curtail capital formation, and slow long-term economic growth[5]. Thus, while deficit financing offers immediacy in implementation, it is fiscally unsustainable without subsequent revenue reforms.  \n\n### Externally Financed and Resource-Based Funds  \n\nA distinct approach draws inspiration from resource-based sovereign funds, with the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend frequently cited as a practical model[2][5]. This system distributes earnings from state-owned resources to residents, funded through investment returns on oil revenues. Although appealing in concept, such a fund cannot easily be scaled to the national level given the limited federal holdings of natural resource wealth and the impracticality of generating comparable investment returns across the entire U.S. economy[5]. Consequently, while viable for smaller, resource-rich states, this framework lacks feasibility as a nationwide fiscal foundation for UBI.  \n\n## Broader Economic and Social Trade-Offs  \n\nEach funding model carries complex macroeconomic trade-offs. Regardless of the chosen mechanism\u2014taxation, borrowing, or reallocation\u2014introducing a large-scale UBI is projected to reduce labor supply, suppress productive capital accumulation, and lower gross domestic product relative to baseline projections[5]. Simultaneously, government expenditures and transfers would expand markedly, reconfiguring the fiscal landscape of federal spending priorities. Balancing these impacts while maintaining economic efficiency and political viability remains among the most profound challenges of implementing UBI in the United States[1][2][5].",
        "report": "### Report: Fiscal and Policy Challenges of Implementing Universal Basic Income in the United States\n\n#### Introduction  \nUniversal Basic Income (UBI) represents a significant departure from the current targeted welfare landscape of the United States, proposing unconditional basic payments to every adult. While conceptually attractive as a tool to alleviate poverty and provide income stability, implementing such a policy poses substantial fiscal and policy challenges. These encompass enormous funding requirements, political constraints, effects on existing welfare programs, and far-reaching economic impacts.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Fiscal Constraints and Cost Challenges  \nThe cost of a UBI program in the United States represents the foremost barrier to implementation. A plan providing $10,000 per adult annually would total approximately $3.28 trillion per year\u2014about 80% of total federal spending\u2014and accumulate roughly $33 trillion over a decade[1]. This expenditure surpasses the combined budgets of all current social welfare programs and would demand an unprecedented expansion of federal revenue.  \n\nEven if UBI payments were treated as taxable income, the offsetting revenue gains would be modest due to the concentration of benefits among low-income households, who often pay little or no federal income tax[1]. Thus, the federal budget would face immense pressure unless paired with transformative tax reforms or deep expenditure cuts elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Potential Funding Mechanisms  \n\n##### 2.1 Tax-Based Approaches  \nOne pathway involves substantially raising existing taxes or implementing new revenue instruments such as wealth, carbon, or consumption taxes[1][3][4]. Although theoretically viable in generating funds, these approaches present considerable trade-offs. Large-scale tax hikes could suppress economic efficiency, reduce disposable income, increase compliance burdens, and provoke political resistance. The fiscal magnitude necessary for full UBI funding has no historical precedent in U.S. tax policy, making political approval highly uncertain[1].\n\n##### 2.2 Program Consolidation and Reallocation  \nAnother option is to reallocate funds by consolidating or eliminating current social programs like SNAP, Medicaid, housing vouchers, or the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)[2][4]. Advocates argue this could simplify the welfare system and improve administrative efficiency. However, because the majority of existing welfare outlays go directly to beneficiaries, administrative savings would be minimal. Moreover, replacing need-based aid with flat payments risks worsening poverty and inequality for vulnerable populations[1], thereby undermining current safety net objectives.\n\n##### 2.3 Payroll Tax Funding  \nDedicated payroll taxes could serve as a stable UBI funding base. For instance, an annual $6,000 UBI per adult could be financed through roughly an 11.25% payroll tax, at an annual cost of $1.5 trillion[5]. While potentially debt-neutral, this method would raise labor costs, discourage workforce participation, and reduce taxable income over time, eroding fiscal sustainability[5].\n\n##### 2.4 Deficit Financing  \nBorrowing to finance UBI through federal deficits is another theoretical strategy. Though politically simpler, sustained deficit financing would sharply escalate national debt and interest obligations, crowding out private investment and impeding long-term economic growth[5]. Without future tax increases or expenditure adjustments, this approach is fiscally unsustainable.\n\n##### 2.5 Resource-Based Sovereign Funds  \nModels inspired by the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend envision financing UBI through returns from federally owned resources or sovereign investment funds[2][5]. Although successful at the state level, scaling this approach nationally would be infeasible given the limited scope of federally controlled natural resources and the difficulty of generating comparable investment returns across a $25-trillion economy[5].\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Impacts on Existing Welfare Programs and Administration  \nReplacing targeted welfare programs with UBI would represent a paradigm shift in U.S. social policy. While simplifying administration, it would remove need-based targeting that ensures concentrated support for low-income groups. Given that most existing program expenditures deliver direct benefits rather than incurring administrative costs, the assumption that UBI would yield large bureaucratic savings is overstated[1]. Additionally, broad-based UBI could exacerbate disparities by reallocating resources from the most vulnerable populations to higher-income recipients who currently receive little or no welfare assistance[1][2].\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Long-Term Economic Implications  \nEach proposed funding strategy entails macroeconomic consequences. Tax-based or payroll-funded UBI is projected to reduce labor supply by increasing effective marginal tax rates, thereby dampening productivity and long-run GDP growth[5]. Deficit-financed models could elevate national debt and crowd out private capital formation. Furthermore, shifting federal spending priorities toward unconditional transfers would reconfigure fiscal policy, potentially constraining investment in infrastructure, education, and healthcare initiatives[1]. Taken together, these effects underscore the tension between UBI\u2019s social objectives and its economic feasibility.\n\n---\n\n#### Conclusion  \nImplementing UBI in the United States entails formidable fiscal and administrative challenges. Funding the program at meaningful levels would require trillions in new expenditures, testing the capacity of traditional revenue sources and political tolerance for tax reform. While proposals to consolidate welfare programs offer partial offsets, they risk undermining the existing safety net that protects the nation\u2019s most economically vulnerable citizens. In the absence of extraordinary fiscal restructuring or a robust new funding source, a universal program of this scale would face major trade-offs in efficiency, equity, and sustainability[1][2][5].  \n\n---\n\n#### References  \n[1] Source discussing UBI fiscal cost estimates, tax implications, and political feasibility.  \n[2] Source analyzing administrative and welfare program trade-offs.  \n[3] Source examining tax-based UBI funding proposals.  \n[4] Source assessing welfare consolidation options.  \n[5] Source evaluating payroll tax, deficit financing, and macroeconomic consequences.",

              "Some UBI proponents respond that policymakers could make the UBI payments taxable. But the savings from doing so would be relatively modest, because the vast bulk of Americans either owe no federal income tax or are in the 10% or 15% tax brackets. For example, if you gave all 328 million Americans a $10,000 UBI and the cost was $3.28 trillion a year (about $33 trillion over ten years) taxes, then making the UBI payments taxable would reduce that cost only to something like $2.5 trillion or $2.75 trillion (or $25 trillion to $27.5 trillion over ten years).\nWhere would the money to finance such a large expenditure come from? That it would come mainly or entirely from new taxes isn\u2019t plausible. We\u2019ll already need substantial new revenues in the coming decades to help keep Social Security and Medicare solvent and avoid large benefit cuts in them. We\u2019ll need further tax increases to help repair a crumbling infrastructure that will otherwise impede economic growth. And if we want to create more opportunity and reduce racial and other barriers and inequities, we\u2019ll also need to raise new revenues to invest more in areas like pre-school education, child care, college affordability, and revitalizing segregated inner-city communities.\nA UBI that\u2019s financed primarily by tax increases would require the American people to accept a level of taxation that vastly exceeds anything in U.S. history. It\u2019s hard to imagine that such a UBI would advance very far, especially given the tax increases we\u2019ll already need for Social Security, Medicare, infrastructure, and other needs.",
              "UBI\u2019s daunting financing challenges raise fundamental questions about its political feasibility, both now and in coming decades. Proponents often speak of an emerging left-right coalition to support it. But consider what UBI\u2019s supporters on the right advocate. They generally propose UBI as a for the current \u201cwelfare state.\u201d That is, they would finance UBI by eliminating all or most programs for people with low or modest incomes. \nConsider what that would mean. If you take the dollars targeted on people in the bottom fifth or two-fifths of the population and convert them to universal payments to people all the way up the income scale, you\u2019re redistributing income . That would increase poverty and inequality rather than reduce them.\nYet that\u2019s the platform on which the (limited) support for UBI on the right largely rests. It entails abolishing programs from SNAP (food stamps) \u2014 which largely eliminated the severe child malnutrition found in parts of the Southern \u201cblack belt\u201d and Appalachia in the late 1960s \u2014 to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Section 8 rental vouchers, Medicaid, Head Start, child care assistance, and many others. These programs lift tens of millions of people, including millions of children, out of poverty each year and make tens of millions more less poor.\nSome UBI proponents may argue that by ending current programs, we\u2019d reap large administrative savings that we could convert into UBI payments. But that\u2019s mistaken. For the major means-tested programs \u2014 SNAP, Medicaid, the EITC, housing vouchers, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and school meals \u2014 administrative costs consume only 1 to 9 percent of program resources, as a CBPP analysis explains. Their funding goes overwhelmingly to boost the incomes and purchasing power of low-income families."

              "Proposed UBI financial mechanisms depend on the underlying objectives for the program. Some UBI proponents view the benefit as a replacement for some or all existing social transfers, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and housing assistance, other targeted federal spending (e.g., agricultural subsidies), and the tax expenditures such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). These proposals suggest that a UBI could be financed in large part by forgone costs of such programs. Some have suggested, however, that new taxes may be needed to cover full UBI program costs.\nOthers view a UBI as a mechanism for distributing income generated from a state-owned resource. For example, the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend provides an annual payment to eligible Alaskan residents generated from an investment fund seeded by Alaskan oil sales; the annual dividend was $1,100 in 2017. Some Native American tribes similarly distribute a share of profits generated from tribe-owned casinos to tribe members. \nUBI programs have been proposed to address a wide range of social issues. Some frame a UBI as an efficiency-improving replacement for the current body of social insurance and welfare programs in the United States. Such a UBI, it is argued, could potentially reduce administrative costs and application burden for recipients, give more freedom to households over how they allocate funds, and encourage households to establish stronger community ties or otherwise establish nongovernmental support systems.",
              "Charles Murray, _In Our Hands: A Plan to Replace the Welfare State_ (Washington, DC: American Enterprise Institute, 2016); and Andy Stern, _Raising the Floor: How a Universal Basic Income Can Renew our Economy and Rebuild the American Dream_\nProgram costs and the related potential for new taxes are among the central concerns expressed about proposed UBI schemes. Two proposals published in 2016 (see \nOther critiques focus on the potential for a UBI to create work disincentives. The labor supply effects of a proposed UBI generally would depend on the benefit amount and other program factors, and its overarching effects on the labor market (e.g., how it affects labor dynamism, private investment in training and education). However, the limited body of related research on universal dividends (e.g., Alaska) and the negative income tax experiments conducted in the 1960s and 1970s do not find large declines in labor force participation. \nUBI critics also raise questions about the replacement of targeted government support with the UBI benefit. They express concern about the fate of households that suffer large financial losses, for example, due to serious illness or catastrophic weather events, and whether the general public has sufficient financial skills to protect against job loss, poor investment outcomes, and other risks. Some proponents acknowledge the need for complementary policies\u2014for example, to improve financial skills and to deter those who would scheme to separate vulnerable recipients from their payments. \nOthers have raised concerns about the possibility of rising prices (i.e., due to increased consumption and upward pressure on wages), and potential future political pressures to increase the benefit amount (beyond inflation), raise taxes, or reinstate discontinued transfer programs.\n_Emma Sifre provided research support for this In_"

              "Despite the United States being one of the wealthiest nations in the world, 12.9% of Americans live in poverty according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure (Shirder and Bijou, 2024). Among this 12.9%, poverty disproportionately affects women and people of color, leading to higher mortality rates within these demographics (Carbonaro, 2023). In addition to poverty, income inequality is a defining feature of the United States economy. $50 trillion has been taken from the bottom 90% of Americans and transferred to the top 1% and the wages of citizens in the top 1% are skyrocketing at rates higher than GDP growth (Hanauer, 2020). When income inequality is high, people experiencing poverty become trapped and upward mobility is limited. In an attempt to decrease poverty and income inequality, many governments\u2014locally, nationally, and internationally\u2014consider tax credit and basic income programs as possible solutions. \nBasic income programs fall under two main categories: (1) universal basic income (UBI) and (2) means-tested basic income. Universal basic income is a government program that provides everyone with a guaranteed cash payment, regardless of income or employment status. On the other hand, a means-tested basic income only provides payment to individuals who meet specific criteria related to financial status, and government benefits are reduced as recipients earn outside income. In order to fund an income program, the federal government would have to increase existing taxes (income, corporate, and excise taxes) or propose a wealth tax (\u201cWhat Options Would Increase Federal Revenues?\u201d, 2024). Aside from funding, there are several aspects policymakers take into consideration when trying to determine if a government policy will be beneficial."

Perhaps the most glaring downside is cost. According to the nonprofit Tax Foundation, Andrew Yang\u2019s $1,000-a-month Freedom Dividend for every adult would have cost $2.8 trillion each year (minus any offsets from the consolidation of other programs). \nYang proposed covering that substantial expense, in part, by shrinking the size of other social programs and imposing a 10% on businesses.

              "## Implementing a Large-Scale UBI Program\nThere are many ways to implement a large-scale UBI program similar in size to the one considered by the Roosevelt Institute. PWBM considers three options that cover a wide range of financing options:\n  * Deficit Financed: $6,000 per year (fixed over time) is given to each adult (defined as age 15 and over), for a total cost of $1.5 trillion annually, which is deficit financed. This approach, therefore, adds to the national debt which reduces private capital service formation over time.\n  * Payroll Tax Financed: $6,000 per year is given to each adult, for a total cost of $1.5 trillion annually, which is financed by an 11.25 percent payroll tax. This approach, therefore, distorts household labor supply decisions by increasing marginal tax rates.\n  * Externally Financed: $6,000 per year is given to each adult, for a total cost of $1.5 trillion annually that is 100-percent financed by external resources. While this Alaskan-type financing is likely implausible at a national scale over a long period of time, we include it as a point of comparison.",
              "Alternatively, a payroll tax could be used to finance this UBI program, as shown by selecting the \u201cPayroll Tax Financed\u201d option in the drop down menu in Table 1. By 2027, federal outlays rise 40.6 percent, relative to current policy. However, because the UBI is financed by a payroll tax, debt is fairly stable and private capital services mainly fall due to households reducing their hours worked by 3.2 percent. GDP falls 1.7 percent, and Social Security revenues drop by 2.4 percent. By 2032, the effects are similar to those in 2027 since debt is not increasing over time.\nWhen \u201cExternally Financed\u201d is selected from the drop down menu in Table 1, the modeled federal outlays are assumed to not change since the UBI transfers are made directly from an Alaskan-type of external fund to households. Nonetheless, by 2027, households feel richer and reduce their hours work by 5.8 percent, which, in turn, reduces household saving for capital services by 3.1 percent and GDP by 3.4. Total revenues fall by 6.1 percent and Social Security revenues fall by 4.5 percent. Fairly similar numbers emerge by the year 2032.\nAt first glance, it appears surprising that GDP falls by more with \u201cExternally Financed\u201d than with a distorting payroll tax. As we explain in more detail in a , the reason stems from the fact that the Externally Financed option produces relatively larger income effects, leading to less labor income and GDP. Households are relatively better off with external financing since it allows them to enjoy more consumption and leisure. The external financing case re-emphasizes the fact that GDP is not always a good measure of household welfare.\nWe estimate three ways to finance a Universal Basic Income program: with deficits, a payroll tax and with transfers funded by external sources. Under all three scenarios, a Universal Basic Income program dampens hours worked, capital services, GDP and Social Security revenues.",

Unlike regular welfare programs, qualification for UBI and the amount received would not depend on earnings or employment of the recipient.\nSo far, there appears to be very little support for UBI among economists, including among traditionally more liberal economists ( and ) and among more traditionally conservative economists ().
