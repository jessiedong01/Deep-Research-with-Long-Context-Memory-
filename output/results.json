  "writeup": "# **Report: Should the United Kingdom Rejoin the European Union?**\n\n---\n\n## **Executive Summary**\n\nBased on comprehensive analysis across political, economic, and social-strategic dimensions, the evidence supports the conclusion that **the United Kingdom should seriously consider rejoining the European Union (EU)**, provided political conditions make this feasible. The anticipated **economic gains**, **restoration of diplomatic influence**, and **social stabilization** that accompany EU membership outweigh the sovereignty-related costs of rejoining.  \n\nThe reported findings highlight that EU membership would:\n- Enhance trade and investment flows,\n- Revitalize the UK\u2019s influence in global governance through collective European mechanisms,\n- Reinforce domestic unity among devolved governments,\n- Strengthen national identity through renewed social cohesion and integration.\n\n---\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nSince Brexit, the UK has navigated an evolving political and economic landscape marked by uncertainty, trade realignment, and identity shifts. The debate regarding rejoining the EU centers on whether the benefits of economic integration, shared governance, and strategic partnership can outweigh concerns over national sovereignty.  \n\nThis report assesses these factors in detail, drawing upon three core analyses\u2014political, economic, and social-strategic\u2014each informed by secondary findings [Child 1][Child 2][Child 3]. The following sections examine rejoining\u2019s implications for the UK\u2019s governance, economic performance, and place in the world.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Political Implications**\n\n### **1.1 Sovereignty and Political Decision-Making Autonomy**\n\nRejoining the EU would reintroduce the **supremacy of EU law** over national legislation, curtailing absolute Westminster sovereignty [node_5]. However, this shift would restore the UK\u2019s formal representation within EU lawmaking institutions, thereby allowing it to **participate in creating regulations** that it currently must accept as an external actor.  \n\nThe UK would trade unilateral control over areas like trade and immigration policy for **frictionless Single Market access** and **shared decision-making influence**. Membership could also strengthen multilevel governance by giving devolved nations direct institutional engagement within EU frameworks, alleviating internal political friction [node_5].\n\n### **1.2 UK Representation and Influence within EU Institutions**\n\nRejoining would elevate UK influence within key EU institutions, notably:\n\n| Institution | UK Representation | Influence Characteristics | Comparison to Current Global Standing | Citations |\n|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|\n| European Parliament | 73 MEPs (~9.7%) | Active legislative participation via transnational parties | Greater policy influence than current lobbying role | [node_6] |\n| European Commission | 1 Commissioner | Equal footing among member states | Direct role in EU executive policy formation | [node_6] |\n| Council of the EU | Weighted voting by population | Collaboration with major economies under QMV | Enhanced structured regional power versus isolated global action | [node_6] |\n\nThis institutional reintegration would substantially magnify the UK\u2019s role in shaping trade, security, and climate policy, converting limited observer influence into active participation [node_6].\n\n### **1.3 Domestic Political Relations and Governance**\n\nWithin the UK, rejoining would likely **soften intergovernmental tensions**. In Scotland, the SNP\u2019s pro-independence case\u2014rooted partly in the prospect of regaining EU access\u2014would be weakened [node_7]. Northern Ireland would benefit from restored alignment with EU regulatory frameworks, easing border complexities with the Republic of Ireland and reinforcing the Good Friday Agreement.  \n\nHowever, Euroskepticism would persist among segments of the electorate, ensuring that EU membership debates continue to feature in domestic politics [node_7].\n\n### **1.4 Summary of Political Implications**\n\nPolitically, rejoining would mean **rebalanced sovereignty**\u2014where autonomy is exchanged for participatory influence and policy leverage. It would stabilize devolved governance, restore credibility in global institutions, and cement the UK\u2019s identity as a co-author of European policy rather than a detached spectator [Child 1].\n\n---\n\n## **2. Economic Implications**\n\n### **2.1 Trade, Tariffs, and Single Market Access**\n\nReintegration into the **Single Market and Customs Union** would reestablish frictionless trade by eradicating tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Comparative evidence shows that trade intensity with the EU would substantially increase, benefiting export-driven sectors [node_8].\n\n| Aspect | Impact of Rejoining | Mechanism | Citations |\n|---------|--------------------|-----------|------------|\n| **Trade Flows** | Restores tariff-free trade and increases trade volume | Reintegration removes customs checks | [node_8] |\n| **Non-EU Trade Relations** | Gains access to EU deals; loses control of bespoke UK agreements | Collective EU trade participation | [node_8] |\n| **Single Market Access** | Revives full freedom in goods, services, labor, and capital | Regulatory alignment reestablishes competitiveness | [node_8] |\n\nThe net effect would be lower compliance costs, quicker cross-border operations, and stronger supply chain predictability for UK businesses [Child 2].\n\n### **2.2 Foreign Direct Investment and Labor Mobility**\n\nEU accession would likely trigger a **14\u201338% surge in foreign direct investment (FDI)** due to renewed stability and regulatory predictability [node_9]. Investor confidence would rebound as the UK reestablishes itself as a strategic entry point into Europe.  \n\nSimultaneously, labor mobility under free movement provisions would alleviate ongoing labor shortages, especially in healthcare, logistics, and agriculture. Although this would limit control over immigration policy, the reciprocal benefits\u2014both economic and social\u2014are substantially higher [node_9].\n\n### **2.3 Economic Performance Outlook**\n\nEnhanced investment, reduced trade friction, and improved mobility would collectively **boost GDP and productivity growth**. Regional manufacturing hubs would benefit from efficient supply chains, while London\u2019s financial services would regain direct EU market access. Fiscal contributions to the EU would be offset by higher tax revenues from expanded economic activity [Child 2].\n\n### **2.4 Summary of Economic Implications**\n\nThe economic case for rejoining is **decisively positive**. Across trade, investment, and workforce dynamics, the evidence suggests tangible medium- and long-term benefits that surpass sovereignty or fiscal costs. Rejoining would restore the UK\u2019s position as an **integrated, high-performing European economy** [Child 2].\n\n---\n\n## **3. Social and Strategic Implications**\n\n### **3.1 Social and Identity-Based Changes**\n\nRejoining would renew **cultural and educational integration** between Britain and Europe. Freedom of movement, academic exchange programs, and collaborative networks\u2014akin to Erasmus and Horizon\u2014would revive person-to-person and institutional ties [node_10].  \n\nDomestically, this would **mitigate societal polarization** associated with Brexit and foster a shared European identity grounded in pragmatism and cooperation [node_10]. The result: greater inclusivity, cohesion, and reduced hostility in national discourse.\n\n### **3.2 Strategic and Geopolitical Outcomes**\n\nStrategically, membership would **reinforce the UK\u2019s multilateral influence**, particularly within European and NATO security frameworks [node_10]. The UK\u2019s re-entry would amplify its voice in joint policymaking on defense, trade, climate, and energy security, reestablishing it as a pivotal transatlantic partner [Child 3].\n\n### **3.3 Integrated Social-Strategic Assessment**\n\nSocial reintegration and strategic alignment are mutually reinforcing. As the UK reconnects culturally with Europe, its diplomatic legitimacy and stability on the global stage would rise. These intertwined effects position rejoining as not merely an economic or political act\u2014but a **civilizational recalibration** toward collective Europeanism [Child 3].\n\n---\n\n## **4. Integrated Evaluation**\n\n### **4.1 Cross-Dimensional Trade-offs**\n\nRejoining entails partial sovereignty pooling and fiscal contributions, yet these costs are outweighed by the **economic efficiency**, **governance stability**, and **diplomatic leverage** regained. Political interdependence complements economic expansion, while social reintegration enhances domestic legitimacy [Child 1][Child 2][Child 3].\n\n### **4.2 Feasibility and Preconditions**\n\nSuccessful re-accession would depend on two factors: (1) sufficient domestic consensus to withstand Euroskeptic resistance, and (2) EU acceptance under updated entry terms. Nonetheless, both are plausible in light of shifting public sentiment and mutual economic interest [Child 1][Child 3].\n\n### **4.3 Synthesis of Findings**\n\nThe evidence converges on a clear picture: Rejoining would revitalize the UK\u2019s **governance capacity**, **economic stature**, and **strategic relevance**. Rather than reversing Brexit nostalgically, it would signify a modern reinvestment in multilateralism and shared prosperity.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Conclusion**\n\n### **5.1 Summary of Evidence**\n\nEach dimension of analysis\u2014political, economic, and social\u2014demonstrates that rejoining the EU offers net-positive outcomes:\n- **Governance:** Restored collaborative sovereignty and institutional influence [Child 1].\n- **Economy:** Strong gains in trade, investment, and labor market performance [Child 2].\n- **Society and Strategy:** Renewed cohesion and international sway [Child 3].\n\n### **5.2 Policy Recommendation**\n\nThe UK should **seriously consider rejoining the European Union** if a viable political mandate arises. Negotiations should prioritize:\n- Maintaining key exemptions where beneficial,\n- Ensuring public dialogue to manage perceptions of sovereignty trade-offs,\n- Promoting domestic consensus to sustain a stable accession process.\n\n### **5.3 Future Outlook**\n\nLong-term, EU reaccession could reposition the UK as a **core European actor**\u2014balancing its Atlantic ties with global influence, cultivating technological cooperation, and advancing climate and security objectives alongside its European partners.\n\n---\n\n## **References**\n\n- [Child 1]: Political Implications \u2013 governance, sovereignty, and institutional participation  \n- [Child 2]: Economic Implications \u2013 trade, FDI, and market integration  \n- [Child 3]: Social and Strategic Implications \u2013 identity, cohesion, and international alignment  \n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:** The integrated evidence indicates that **rejoining the EU would deliver substantial national benefits**, and should remain a serious policy option in the UK\u2019s pursuit of prosperity, unity, and global relevance.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Five reasons why rejoining the EU is a difficult path to follow - https://ukandeu.ac.uk/five-reasons-why-rejoining-the-eu-is-a-difficult-path-to-follow/\n[2] Resolved: The United Kingdom Should Rejoin the European Union - https://debateus.org/resolved-the-united-kingdom-should-rejoin-the-european-union/\n[3] Brexit: Make hard choices but don't confuse sovereignty with autonomy - https://www.brookings.edu/articles/brexit-make-hard-choices-but-dont-confuse-sovereignty-with-autonomy/\n[4] Britain, the EU and the Sovereignty Myth - Chatham House - https://www.chathamhouse.org/2016/05/britain-eu-and-sovereignty-myth\n[5] Imposing (and accepting) constraints on sovereignty - https://cjel.law.columbia.edu/preliminary-reference/2016/final-thoughts-on-a-potential-brexit-imposing-and-accepting-constraints-on-sovereignty/\n[6] European Parliament elections in the UK | Institute for Government - https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/article/explainer/european-parliament-elections-uk\n[7] 11 things you need to know about the European elections - https://ukandeu.ac.uk/explainers/11-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-european-elections-2/\n[8] The European Parliament election \u2013 After EU exit, does it matter?

        "The of 2016 suggests that such votes might not go as polling suggests. In such a scenario, Leave parties might have lost the preceding general election, but they would still have considerable resources and activists to push a message that would inevitably revolve around how politicians want to overturn the 2016 decision.\nThe ability of campaigners to get voters to actually vote would be more constrained in any new vote, as they will face the additional hurdle of explaining why the public need to return to an issue that was supposedly settled only a few years ago. The legitimacy of a rejoin majority but with fewer votes than Leave last time would open a new point of attack from those who wanted to fight it.\nAt which point we run into the elephant in the room: rejoining isn\u2019t just up to the UK.\nThe EU holds all the over whether to let a country become a member: rejoining states don\u2019t get any special rights in that regard. Not only do you have to comply with entry requirements on political and economic capacity to manage the effects of membership, but you also have to get the explicit approval of all existing member states and of the European Parliament.\nNone of that is a given.\nAs times passes, the UK is diverging from EU standards. Moreover, as a new applicant the UK would be obliged to commit to being part of those bits of the EU that it used to have opt-outs on, like the Euro, Schengen and various bits of justice and home affairs.\nMember states and the EU Parliament might also have doubts about whether they want the UK back. They might be concerned, for example, that the UK would stymie certain policy agendas, since the UK would once more be getting to vote on things it dislikes (such as, possibly, the package with its debt financing)."

        "Another major pro-EU argument centers on . Inside the EU, the UK had a seat at the table in shaping European-wide decisions that inevitably affect its interests; outside, the UK has found it often must accept or adjust to EU decisions without a voice. Advocates for rejoining argue that Britain\u2019s global influence was amplified by being an EU member. The EU, with its combined economic weight and regulatory power, can set standards (from environmental rules to tech regulation) that smaller individual countries often end up following. As an EU member, the UK was one of the \u201cBig Three\u201d alongside Germany and France, and British diplomats and Members of the European Parliament had significant sway over EU policies. If the UK rejoined, it could once again help steer EU policy on trade, digital regulation, climate change, and more, rather than watching from the outside. This influence is seen as especially important given that many EU rules will affect the UK regardless \u2013 for instance, EU product standards must be met by UK companies exporting to Europe. It would be better to \u201cbe in the room\u201d and shape those rules than to be a rule-taker, proponents say.\nDomestically, rejoining the EU could also ease certain political tensions. For example, it might strengthen the unity of the UK itself. Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in 2016; Brexit has since fueled calls for Scottish independence and complicated governance in Northern Ireland. If the UK as a whole re-enters the EU, the pressure for Scotland to leave the UK in order to rejoin Europe might diminish. Essentially, UK-wide EU membership could remove one of the grievances that separatists cite (Scotland \u201cbeing taken out of the EU against its will\u201d). Some unionists argue this would help \u201ctake the wind out of the sails\u201d of Scottish independence sentiment and thus preserve the UK\u2019s integrity.",
        "Proponents also argue that rejoining would affirm the UK\u2019s commitment to . The EU\u2019s laws on things like food safety (e.g., banning certain additives), environmental law (water quality, air pollution limits), and digital regulation (like the GDPR for data privacy) set a benchmark. Since Brexit, the UK government has considered or enacted changes that diverge \u2013 for example, contemplating lowering food import standards or scrapping some EU-derived worker protections. Those in favor of EU membership worry this could lead to a erosion of standards in the long run (a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d). By rejoining, the UK would recommit to those shared high standards and eliminate the risk of regulatory rollback in areas where the EU leads. Essentially, it future-proofs certain rights and norms by binding the UK into the collective legal commitments of the EU.\nFinally, there\u2019s a constitutional argument: Brexit and its aftermath have been very consuming for the UK\u2019s governance, sparking legal battles (like the 2019 prorogation of Parliament case) and questions about the (Scotland and Northern Ireland\u2019s place in the Union). Some legal scholars in the pro-EU camp argue that rejoining could provide a stable framework for the UK\u2019s internal constitutional arrangements, because the EU\u2019s multilevel governance gives a voice to regions (Scotland and Wales could engage in EU forums) and lessens some conflicts. While this is a more abstract point, the idea is that the EU framework supports the rule of law and pluralism , which aligns with the UK\u2019s own constitutional values.",
        "In summary, legal alignment with the EU is portrayed as beneficial for consistency, rights, and standards. Rejoining would erase the legal fragmentation that Brexit created, making life simpler for businesses and citizens and ensuring that the UK operates under the robust legal regime that governs its neighbors. It would trade a bit of abstract sovereignty for a lot of practical legal cohesion and clout (since the UK would again help shape EU laws via the Council and Parliament).\nOn the global stage, proponents argue that both the UK and Europe as a whole would be geopolitically stronger if the UK rejoins the EU. We live in a time of \u2013 the United States and China are superpowers, Russia is an aggressive regional power, and new blocs are forming. Europe must remain united to assert its interests and values in this environment. A UK inside the EU makes the and creates a bloc of democracies in Europe that is more comparable in weight to the U.S. or China. Geostrategically, a reunited Europe including Britain would command greater respect in trade negotiations, climate negotiations, and in setting international standards."

        "> Effective U.K. autonomy depends more on the complex web of economic, social, and cultural interactions with the rest of the world than it does on the U.K. government\u2019s formal political power.\nEffective U.K. autonomy depends more on the complex web of economic, social, and cultural interactions with the rest of the world than it does on the U.K. government\u2019s formal political power. Those interactions inescapably erode the ability of the UK\u2019s government and citizens to make independent untrammeled decisions. Yes, the UK\u2019s membership in the European Union erodes formal sovereignty. Economic, social, and cultural interrelationships intentionally erode sovereignty. However, because of the cooperative relationships across the English Channel, the UK\u2019s membership in the European Union has on balance rather than eroded effective U.K. autonomy. British skeptics can legitimately argue that the EU Commission and its governments may have adopted excessive regulations. But skeptics cannot argue that those decisions were taken without U.K. participation. Whatever future decisions may be made about Brexit, moreover, many of the existing cooperative relationships with the EU are likely to be maintained\u2014precisely to forestall an unwanted deterioration in effective U.K. autonomy.\nAnti-EU sentiment can question not only whether economic relations with the EU have been conducted appropriately. EU skeptics may logically complain about unwanted immigration from Europe. They may logically assert that EU membership undermines U.K. culture and national identity. It would be unfortunate, however, if most Brits were to favor a Brexit because of superficial yearning for elusive sovereignty.",
        "Think of regulations and oversight about the production and marketing of medications. By agreement of all EU members including the UK, cooperative oversight throughout the EU is typically beneficial. The functions of the European Medicines Agency are to provide such oversight. If an exit-deal Brexit is to occur, cooperative adjustments need to be found to support some form of continuation of the EMA\u2019s oversight. Analogous comments apply to a wide range of issues that affect all members of the European Union. Another example highly important to the U.K. is the design of regulations and oversight for the provision of financial services throughout the EU.\nRegulation and oversight of immigration from Europe is more controversial. Some British residents complain, for example, that the free movement of labour within the EU has led to a surge of Europeans coming into the UK, taking jobs away from locals, flooding the schools with their children, committing crimes. Emotions can run high about threats to national culture and traditional ways of life. In turn the U.K. governments experience strong pressure to reduce the ease of movement of Europeans crossing the U.K. border.\nMost of the difficult issues will require UK-EU cooperation whether or not the U.K. finds itself outside the EU fence. The issue areas had to be addressed in the past while the U.K. was inside the European Union. They will need continued attention even if the U.K. chooses a no-Brexit remain."

        "## Do not sell or share my personal information\n#  Britain, the EU and the Sovereignty Myth\nThe argument that Britain needs to leave the European Union to reclaim its sovereignty is misguided says new paper, Britain, the EU and the Sovereignty Myth.\nBig Ben from Trafalgar Square, London. Photo: iStock.\n  * The question of sovereignty lies at the heart of the UK\u2019s upcoming EU referendum. Many in Britain believe that the process of EU decision-making has undermined British parliamentary democracy, and that leaving the EU is the only way for the British people to regain control of their sovereignty.\n  * This ignores the fact that successive British governments have chosen to pool aspects of the country\u2019s sovereign power in the EU in order to achieve national objectives that they could not have achieved on their own, such as creating the single market, enlarging the EU, constraining Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, and helping to design an ambitious EU climate change strategy.\n  * Apart from EU immigration, the British government still determines the vast majority of policy over every issue of greatest concern to British voters \u2013 including health, education, pensions, welfare, monetary policy, defence and border security. The arguments for leaving also ignore the fact that the UK controls more than 98 per cent of its public expenditure.\n  * The British economy has prospered in the EU. The UK boasts higher economic growth and lower unemployment than most major developed economies. It attracts the most foreign direct investment in the EU, and is ranked among the most open places to do business in the developed world. British economic weaknesses, such as low growth in productivity, are self-inflicted.",
        "* However, a successful economy and free-movement rules have led to high levels of immigration from the EU. Overall, this has been positive for the UK economy, but it has exacerbated preexisting pressures on public services, may have restricted wage growth in some sectors, and is a source of widespread public concern.\n  * Is it time, therefore, to return economic and political sovereign power entirely to Westminster? The risks of doing so are extensive. For example, the UK would be excluded from the process of EU rule-writing, making it a less attractive location for foreign investment. The UK is unlikely to strike better trade deals alone than it has currently through the EU. And the UK would have no say in the design of more open EU markets for digital, financial and other services. Leaving would also have a destabilizing effect on the rest of the EU, which will remain Britain\u2019s largest market.\n  * In contrast, the main risks to the UK of remaining are political. High levels of immigration from the EU would persist. However, it is inconceivable that the EU will enlarge to include Turkey in the foreseeable future, and the UK and other EU states retain a veto over this decision.\n  * Nor need the UK fear the emergence of a more integrated eurozone, which will continue to feature profound differences in national outlook and is unlikely to enlarge quickly. EU decision-making overall is also becoming more intergovernmental rather than centralized.\n  * Continuing to pool its sovereign power selectively in the EU would enable the UK to help design integrated EU responses to many challenges that it cannot resolve on its own. These include the challenges of energy efficiency and sustainability; energy security; internet governance; and the fight against terrorism.",
        "* In a world that is more interdependent today than it was when the UK joined the European Economic Community in 1973, the notion of \u2018absolute\u2019 British sovereignty is illusory. It is also worthless if it limits the ability of future British governments to ensure the security and prosperity of their citizens. Judging from the UK\u2019s experience and its future prospects, the opportunities from remaining in the EU far outweigh the risks of doing so, and the risks of leaving far outweigh the opportunities."

In the UK\u2019s case, there is little doubt that joining the EU has resulted in at least some loss of sovereignty (despite the fact that Parliament retains the right to repeal the ). Even though the UK knew going in that there were , probably few could have predicted in 1972 that the EU would now resemble such a close political union, on the verge of incorporating a federalist structure. Nevertheless, Britain has been a willing\u2014if begrudging\u2014member along the way, ratifying and participating in the European project. And while the Union has certainly been throughout the years, the last decade has brought about its most serious challenges, with the , and the recent EU . With these two ordeals straining the functionality of a closer Union, the Tory government led the UK into a referendum on EU membership that has divided their party, and challenged their commitment to the European project. In February Prime Minister Cameron he thinks will provide Britain more autonomy and prosperity, but by the news media. While the majority of international leaders have the UK to remain in the EU, one vocal supporter stood out from the pack: Barack Obama."

        "Currently, the European Parliament is made up of 751 MEPs who are organised into eight political groups. These are not strictly parties, but rather coalitions between MEPs from different countries with similar ideological outlooks. A minimum of 25 members representing at least one quarter of member states are needed to form a group. Not all MEPs belong to a political group \u2013 these are known as non-attached members. Each MEP serves for a five-year term. The UK elects 73 of those.\nBoth the UK and the EU27 have recognised that delaying the UK\u2019s Brexit date will likely require the UK to hold European Parliament elections.\nThere are three main reasons for this:\n1) EU members states are legally required to hold European Parliament elections. The European Commission could choose to initiate treaty infringement proceedings against the UK for denying UK or EU citizens in the UK the right to vote, or indeed stand, in European Parliament elections. Any attempt to install MEPs without elections could also be subject to challenge in the EU courts.\n2) If the UK decided to remain a member state past July but had not taken part in the EU elections, then the new European Parliament \u2013 without British seats \u2013 would not be able to carry out its activities.\n3) Excluding the UK would require treaty reform, which the EU would find hard to agree at very short notice, not least given the need for ratification by member states.\nHowever, if the UK has ratified the Withdrawal Agreement \u2013 which requires parliamentary approval \u2013 by 22 May, the UK will not need to take part in the elections. If Parliament does not approve a deal by this time and the UK does not hold European Parliament elections, it will have to leave the EU without a deal on 1 June.",
        "In June 2018, the EU decided it would reduce the overall number of seats in the European Parliament after Brexit to 705 (down from 751) and reallocate 27 of the 73 UK seats to other EU countries. The plan was for this distribution to be effective from the next European Parliament. If the UK were to take part, the EU would need to halt this reconfiguration.\nVoting across other member states will take place between 23\u201326 May. Results cannot be announced before 11:00pm Brussels time on 26 May to ensure the results in one country do not prejudice votes in another. New MEPs will take up their seats on 2 July.\nThe EU needs to know by mid-April whether to halt the reconfiguration of seats. On the UK side, the Government has already laid the necessary legislation allowing the UK to take part in the 2019 European Parliament elections on 23 May.\nThe deadline for registered parties submitting the candidates they want to contest the election to the Electoral Commission is 25 April. Individual parties have their own deadlines for candidates applying to run.\nThe UK is divided into 12 regions: nine in England, and one each for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each region has a set number of MEPs, who are elected through proportional representation \u2013 although the method differs between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In England, Scotland and Wales, MEPs are elected using the [D\u2019Hondt system within each region](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27187434). Parties draw up regional lists of candidates which they share with the electorate. The party that wins the most votes can send the candidate at the top of its list to Brussels. The winning party\u2019s vote total is then halved, and the party with the highest tally in the second re-ordered list can send an MEP to Brussels. The process repeats itself until all candidates for the region are appointed.",
        "The 73 British MEPs would cease to be members once the UK has left the EU. It is unclear whether plans for a post-Brexit reconfiguration of the European Parliament would then come into effect before the 2024 European Parliament elections.\nPotentially. In 2014, the EU introduced the (lead candidate) process to select the new President of the EU Commission. This meant that rather than simply emerging from discussion in the Council, EU leaders proposed the lead candidate of the biggest parliamentary grouping as the new president of the Commission. Jean-Claude Juncker was nominated under this process as the lead candidate of the European People\u2019s Party.\nMost parliamentary groupings have already selected their candidates this time: these include German MEP Manfred Weber for the European People\u2019s Party and Frans Timmermans, the Dutch Vice President of the Commission, for the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. No UK MEP would boost the numbers of the European People's Party since the Conservatives left the grouping in 2009, but Labour MEPs would increase the numbers in the Socialists and Democrats. It is possible that this could make a difference to the numbers \u2013 but it is also possible that EU leaders could decide to nominate a candidate from another parliamentary grouping or someone other than a designated \nWhat tariffs has Donald Trump announced \u2013 and what do they mean for the UK? \nEconomic and fiscal forecasts are a critical part of the government budget process.

        "## How do the elections work?\nGreat Britain uses a list system and divides the country into 12 electoral regions, with voters casting a single vote for their preferred party. Northern Ireland uses the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system for its three MEPs, where voters can choose their second and third preferences.\nPolitical parties produce lists of candidates for each region and order the candidates according to who is their first nomination. The \u2018closed list system\u2019 used in the UK means that voters simply cast one vote for the party that they wish to support, and the parties decide in what order their candidates are listed.\nAs parties win seats, those at the top of the lists gain them first. The number of seats each party receives is calculated using the d\u2019Hondt method of proportional representation. The party with the most votes wins the first seat available.\nHowever, once a party has been given a seat, its votes are halved (i.e. divided by the number of seats it has, plus one) and whoever has the most votes after that gets the next seat. If the winning party gets substantially more votes than any other, it could also win the second seat. If that were the case, its total votes would then be divided by the number of seats it has plus one (three in total), and the process continues until all of the seats up for election are distributed.\nDo elections work the same way everywhere in the EU?\nNo. Although the electoral systems used must all be proportional, member states can use different proportional systems. The \u2018closed list system\u2019 used in the UK means that voters simply cast one vote for the party that they wish to support, and the parties decide in what order their candidates are listed. However, a majority of EU countries use a \u2018preferential list system\u2019, allowing voters to cast ballots for both parties and individual candidates. Ireland and Malta use the same \u2018single transferable vote system\u2019 which is used in Northern Ireland.",
        "In most member states (eg. Spain), MEPs are elected to a single, nation-wide constituency. In others, such as the UK, MEPs represent constituencies (one of 12 regions). Minimum age requirements, electoral thresholds, compulsory voting, requirements to stand for election, and the particular date and time of the elections differ across the EU.\nThe European Council has set out how the UK\u2019s seats will be redistributed to other member states should it leave the EU. Of the 73, only 27 will be reallocated, reducing the European Parliament to 705 MEPs in total.\nThe fact Brexit hasn\u2019t happened complicates the elections for those states earmarked to receive extra MEPs. Ireland, for instance, currently elects 11 MEPs, but when the UK leaves it will gain a further two seats. If the UK takes part this time but leaves during the parliament, Ireland and others will have to fill these seats. As a result, Ireland is electing \u2018reserve\u2019 candidates at this election who will take up the extra seats when and if the UK leaves.\nHow are parties organised in the European Parliament?\nUnlike the UK, MEPs sit in cross-national groups that their national parties are affiliated with, largely based around shared political ideologies. For instance, the Conservatives sit with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group and Labour sit with the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) group. These groups tend to vote in blocs in much the same way as political parties do in Westminster.\nAlthough most groups persist from one parliament to the next, new groupings tend to be formed in each five-year term. A group must have at least 25 MEPs from at least seven member states. There were eight political groups in the 2014-19 parliament running across the full spectrum from far-left to far-right. No single group is even close to a majority of seats in the Parliament, so coalition-building is part and parcel of how the Parliament works.\n## Subscribe to the UKICE newsletter"

        "This week\u2019s European Parliament election (22\u201325 May) has several unprecedented features. Most importantly, the main pan-European parties are fielding lead candidates for European Commission President. Turning the election into a presidential horse race was intended to increase electoral participation and enhance the Parliament\u2019s democratic legitimacy, even though it remains to be seen whether voters will actually see things this way.\nCritics often blame European citizens\u2019 relative lack of interest in the European Parliament on its inherent inequality of representation. Voters in smaller member states are overrepresented. Germany\u2019s Federal Constitutional Court, when ruling on the Lisbon Treaty on 30 June 2009, said that the European Parliamentary election process \u2018does not take due account of equality\u2019. In the Court\u2019s view, this constitutes one of two key factors in the European Union\u2019s \u2018structural democratic deficit\u2019, the other being the European Parliament\u2019s \u2018position in the European competence structure\u2019, i.e. its lack of power compared to other EU institutions.\nHow unequal is the representation comparatively? \nIn the Treaty on European Union, government representation in the lower house is based on both a principle of disproportionate electoral weight given to smaller countries, and on binding thresholds of minimum and maximum representation. As a consequence, the European Parliament is at the low end in terms of electoral equality.\n  * One way to measure voter inequality is to look at the \u2018voting Gini coefficient\u2019.\n  * This uses the familiar measure of inequality of income, but applies it to European Parliament voting power per voter.",
        "Figure 1 shows the Gini coefficients for the European Parliament (EP) and that of several other parliaments. Voting power in the EP is outside the norm of individual European countries in terms of equality of representation. Germany, whose professed commitment to this principle is unparalleled among countries reviewed, is at the other end of the spectrum. Indeed, the European Parliament is at the low end in terms of electoral equality even beyond Europe.\n. Voting Gini coefficients\nHigher levels of inequality of representation may be expected in larger, more diverse polities where the political complexity of federal arrangements leads to awkward institutional compromises, which is definitely the case of the EU. In our sample, high voting Gini coefficients are indeed also observed for the lower houses in India and Brazil, which come closest to the EP on that measure. For example, in Brazil voters from Sao Paulo state are notoriously underrepresented. Yet the US and Indonesia, which are also large and diverse, both display comparatively low voting Gini coefficients.\nHow much change would produce an acceptable level of equality of representation? \nRead in a different light, Figure 1 suggests that the European Parliament would not need to go all the way to representative equality as high as the German Bundestag to join the norm of lower chambers in democratic polities. This is important, since a modified distribution of seats that reduced the voting Gini coefficient to something like 10% could be achieved without entirely renouncing the Treaty principle of \u2018degressive proportionality\u2019 as currently implemented by the European Council. It would, however, require lowering the minimum of six MEP seats per member state, and thus a modification of the Treaty on European Union.",
        "The EU Treaties stipulate that \u2018Representation of citizens should be degressively proportional, with a minimum threshold of six members [of the European Parliament] per Member State. No Member State shall be allocated more than ninety-six seats\u2019 (Article 14(2) of the Treaty on European Union). The ratio between the maximum and minimum (96/6) is 16 to 1, while the ratio between voting-age populations of the largest and smallest members (Germany and Luxembourg, respectively) is more than 172 to 1. However, no specific formula for representation is provided, and the exact composition is to be adopted by unanimous decision of the European Council. The latest apportionment decision was adopted in June 2013, in the run-up to the accession of Croatia as the EU\u2019s 28th member state.\nFor most countries reviewed, average voting-age population per government representative is based on the total population per relevant territorial subdivision (e.g. state or province), taken from each country\u2019s census bureau, and on the \u2018Voting-Age Population\u2019 (VAP) variable from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA)\u2019s database ()."

        "A Yes vote in a referendum accepted as legitimate by both sides would be followed by negotiations between the UK and Scottish governments on the terms of separation, including on how to divide the assets and liabilities of the UK state and on the future relationship between the two new countries.\nThe SNP plan is for an independent Scotland to re-join the EU. As the UK has already left the EU, an independent Scotland would need to apply to join under Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union after first completing its separation from the rest of the UK. Re-entry would require accession negotiations and the consent of all 27 EU member states.\nAn independent Scotland would also have to [decide which currency to use](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/publications/scotland-currency).

      "excerpts": [
        "One of the most intense debates during the 2014 independence referendum was whether or not Scotland could maintain uninterrupted membership of the European Union if it became an independent country. The UK Government argued that the rest of the UK would be the \u2018continuing state\u2019 and would exclusively retain the rights and obligations of the UK\u2019s current membership. Consequently, Scotland would have to apply afresh to become an EU member after becoming independent. The Scottish Government, in contrast, took the view that as Scotland would already be fully compliant with the requirements of EU membership, there was every reason to believe the country would be able seamlessly to become an EU member in its own right.",
        "Of course, just two years after Scotland voted by 55% to 45% to remain inside the UK, the UK as a whole \u2013 though not Scotland itself \u2013 voted to Leave the EU. Eventually, after some years of political turmoil, the UK formally left the political institutions at the end of January 2020, while it exited the single market and customs union at the end of that year. As a result, the debate that was held in 2014 on the implications of independence for Scotland\u2019s membership of the EU has been overtaken by events. Perhaps, then, it was not entirely surprising that after it became clear that the UK was heading for a relatively \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit, in March 2017, just two and a half years after the original ballot, the then First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, called for a second independence referendum. That call has, of course, not been answered. But Brexit does mean that, unless there is a change in the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU, the choice with which Scotland\u2019s voters would be presented in a second independence referendum would not, as in 2014, simply be whether it should be inside or outside the UK, but, rather, whether it should be in the UK but outside the EU, or inside the EU but outside the UK. Doubtless, once again, part of the debate would be about whether and how easily an independent Scotland would be able to secure EU membership. However, now voters would be being asked whether it would be better for Scotland to seek EU membership rather than retain its current position in the UK.",
        "Moreover, this link between support for the EU and support for independence is underpinned by how people regard the consequences of the choice that Scotland now seems to face in its constitutional debate, that is, between being part of the UK but outside the EU and being part of the EU but outside the UK. On many issues voters are more likely to believe that being in the EU would be better for Scotland than they are to feel that being in the UK would be better \u2013 and these voters are highly likely to say they would vote Yes. However, while the balance of opinion may be more favourable to EU membership rather than being part of the UK, it is still the case that in most instances less than half believe that EU membership would be advantageous. Many are of the view that it would not make much difference and are also seemingly more inclined to stick with the status quo. Meanwhile, although Yes voters appear to have few qualms about signing up to freedom of movement, they are much less ready to embrace the euro, and more broadly the question of what currency an independent Scotland should use remains contentious.\nOf course, in practice little has happened in the debate about Scotland\u2019s constitutional status since the implementation of Brexit. The COVID-19 pandemic prevented any significant discussion of the issue, while more recently the SNP\u2019s political difficulties have left the party unable to make the political weather. As a result, voters have had little exposure to the issues that would arise in the choice between being in the UK and being part of the EU, and we cannot be sure what view they would form when they have heard more about the issues at stake. But what is now clearly the case is that it is a debate that will be crucial to how voters regard Scotland\u2019s constitutional future."

Rather than simply being a question of whether Scotland should be part of the UK, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, framed the choice facing the country as being \u201coutside the UK, but inside the EU\u201d, versus being \u201cinside the UK but outside the EU\u201d. \nIn short, any future referendum on independence would be as much about Brexit as it would be about Scotland\u2019s relationship with the rest of the UK.\nThis, perhaps, is not surprising. After all, in the EU referendum in June 2016, Scotland voted 62% to 38% to remain in the EU. that support for being part of the EU is even higher now. Meanwhile, from the SNP\u2019s point of view, the outcome of the Brexit referendum provided the clearest possible illustration of their claim that, as part of the UK, Scotland is at risk of having its \u201cdemocratic wishes\u201d overturned by the less progressive views of voters south of the border.",
        "The question of whether Scotland could rejoin the EU if it left the UK was much debated in 2014\u2019s independence referendum (the Yes side said it would, the No campaign that it would not). At that point there did not appear to be a strong link between voters\u2019 attitudes towards the EU and their attitudes towards independence. According to the , 49% of voters with a sceptical outlook towards the EU (that is, they either thought that the UK should leave the EU or that the EU\u2019s powers should be reduced) voted for independence. Only slightly fewer \u2013 44% \u2013 of those who thought the EU should remain at least as powerful as it was voted the same way.\nThis pattern was also reflected in how people in Scotland voted two years later in the EU referendum. According to the , the level of support for Remain among those who voted Yes (62%) two years earlier was much the same as among those who had backed No (60%). \nSince the early 1990s, the SNP\u2019s vision of independence has been one of Scotland in the EU. Yet there has always been an element of the party\u2019s support that wished to avoid both the constraints of EU membership, as well as the limitations created by being part of the UK.\n## What has changed since 2016\nAfter the Brexit referendum, some voters began to reassess their attitudes towards independence in light of the decision to leave the EU. As the SNP anticipated, some who had voted No in 2014 and Remain in 2016 switched to backing independence. But these were counterbalanced by some who had voted Yes in 2014 but Leave in 2016, switching in the opposite direction to support Scotland remaining in the UK."

And you\u2019re absolutely right that developments in Northern Ireland and in Ireland, actually, with its relationship with the U.K., now that the U.K. is outside of the internal market, these things are being observed quite closely in Scotland.

        "The success of the Brexit Leave campaign in June 2016 and the subsequent exit process culminating in the EU-UK trade deal, negotiated at the end of 2020, has further heightened the debate in both Scotland and Northern Ireland about their citizens\u2019 preferred territorial status. As of this writing, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement has not prevented business disruption between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK nor between the UK and EU. Considering first the Scottish case, there has been much political discussion about whether Brexit justifies Scotland pursuing another independence bid, and the current governing Scottish National Party (SNP) supports a second independence referendum after the failed 2014 effort. After the SNP\u2019s success in the December 2019 general election, its leader Nicola Sturgeon claimed that the electoral success indicated that the party had a \u201c\u2026 renewed, refreshed and strengthened mandate\u201d to pursue a second referendum (), as the SNP claims that many Scots prefer being in the EU to being in the UK outside of the EU. To date, conservative governments under both Theresa May and Boris Johnson have denied the possibility of a second Scottish independence referendum.\nMost evidence on the evolution of the Scottish independence movement, prior to and just after the failed 2014 referendum, shows that both Scottish identity and beliefs about economic prospects of an independent Scotland are correlated with support for independence (e.g. , , , ; , , ). discuss the increasing salience of independence as an issue promoted by the SNP and how independence became a key political cleavage in the last 10\u201315 years, and show that the 2014 independence referendum itself accelerated this re-alignment where support for the SNP became increasingly due to pro-independence views. Support for independence appears to have increased since the failed 2014 referendum (, ), but there are few studies exploring the role that Brexit plays in such preferences.",
        "On the particular connection between the Scottish independence and Brexit, the debate prior to the failed referendum of 2014 and since has been premised partially on the assumption that a Scottish exit would allow it to re-enter EU. There is suggestive but not recent evidence that Scottish independence support is conditioned by expectations of international recognition. [Muro, Vidal, and Vlaskamp (2020)](javascript:;) find using 2014 survey experimental evidence that the prospect of international recognition increases support for independence; find weaker evidence that the prospect of EU recognition increases independence support on average, but that key sub-groups of Scots are more responsive to the possibility of such recognition. As with the above evidence on the role of economic expectations in the wake of possible independence, though, the causal role of expectations of EU recognition remains unclear (as such beliefs may not be separate from territorial preferences). Related, some have argued that a subset of SNP voters supported Leave strategically in order to produce the conditions for a second independence referendum ([Greene, Spoon, and Williams 2018](javascript:;)). This latter evidence however finds it difficult to disentangle the relationship between current territorial preferences and SNP support, and finds that a very large majority of independence supporters from 2014 also supported Remain; further, prior to Brexit, SNP leadership had strongly supported Remain. This set of findings provides suggestive support of the basic logic of territorial preferences being affected by negative shocks to the existing \u201cunion,\u201d but these previous data either come from prior to the Scottish referendum and Brexit (and the corresponding political fallout), or do not focus on Brexit scenarios. We draw on this evidence to argue that the role of Brexit scenarios should affect territorial views in Scotland."

        "# Scotland, independence, Brexit and the border\nThere is no doubt that Brexit has reenergised the campaign for independence in Scotland. The fact that Scotland had to leave the EU with the rest of the UK, despite 62% of Scots voting Remain in the Brexit referendum, created a grievance and a sense that Scotland\u2019s voice was being ignored.\nThe Brexit process has contributed to these feelings too. The Scottish government, along with the other devolved administrations, struggled to have any influence over Brexit negotiations. In preparing for Brexit, the UK government passed a series of laws that threaten to undermine the Scottish Parliament\u2019s law-making power. The [United Kingdom Internal Market Act](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4018581) is the most notable of these.\nAdding insult to injury, this Act was passed despite the Scottish Parliament (along with the Welsh Senedd) withholding its consent, against an established constitutional convention \u2013 known as the \u2013 which specifies that the UK Parliament will not normally pass laws in devolved areas without the consent of the devolved legislatures.\nThe Scottish government, led by the Scottish National Party, is committed to holding an independence referendum before the end of 2023. Rejoining the European Union will be central to its independence ambitions. But Brexit brings new challenges to the prospect of \u2018independence in Europe\u2019, and chief amongst these is the status of the border Scotland shares with England.\nFollowing Scottish independence, this would become an international border between Scotland and the UK; and if Scotland rejoined the EU, it would also become a new border between the EU and the UK. As an EU member state, Scotland would have obligations to manage and protect this EU border."

        "The EU is an important trade partner for the UK: in 2024, UK exports of goods and services to the EU were \u00a3358 billion (41% of all UK exports). Imports from the EU were \u00a3454 billion (51% of the UK total).\n## Trade affected by Brexit and other factors\nThe UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU changed fundamentally after Brexit. The UK is now outside the EU single market and customs union. While there are no tariffs on trade in goods with the EU, subject to certain conditions, other barriers to trade are now higher. Brexit has also led to changes in the way data on trade in goods with the EU is collected. There is a structural break in the data from January 2021.\nIt is important to remember, however, that other factors, such as the covid-19 pandemic, the Ukraine conflict and disruption to global supply chains, have affected UK trade with the EU and other countries.\n## Little growth in goods exports\nThe UK\u2019s recent trade performance in services has been much better than that for goods. UK goods exports to the EU fell sharply in January 2021 after the end of the Brexit transition period, before recovering strongly in February 2021. Goods exports to the EU remain below their pre-pandemic/Brexit level, however: in 2024, goods exports to the EU were 18% below their 2019 level in real terms. It is important to point out, however, that goods exports to the EU were growing slowly before Brexit and the pandemic. In addition, exports to non-EU countries in 2024 were also 14% below their 2019 level in real terms.\nUK exports of services to both EU and non-EU countries fell in 2020 but have grown strongly since then. In 2024, UK exports of services to the EU were 19% above their 2019 level in real terms. Exports to non-EU countries were 23% above their 2019 level.\n## EU share of UK trade"

        "#  How has Brexit changed EU\u2013UK trade flows?\nAuthor links open overlay panel, \nThis paper estimates how  has affected goods trade between the United Kingdom and . Using product-level trade flows between the EU and all other countries in the world as a comparison group, we find a sharp decline in trade from the UK to the EU and significant but smaller reductions in trade from the EU to the UK. However, when we estimate the size of the impact on trade using UK data and UK global trade as a benchmark, we find strikingly different results. We identify two key sources of this discrepancy. First, the UK\u2019s global exports grew relatively slowly. We argue these are not suitable as a no-Brexit counterfactual. Second, Brexit also led to breaks in the measurement of trade flows, particularly for the EU imports data. To resolve these issues, we combine UK-reported data for its trade with EU and EU data for its trade with the rest of the world to use as the appropriate benchmark for comparison. This generates an estimate that Brexit reduced trade by close to 20% in both directions.\nFollowing the decision to leave the European Union (EU) taken by a referendum in the United Kingdom (UK) in June 2016, a process of extensive negotiations on the withdrawal arrangements and future trading relationship began. These continued up until days before the agreed (and several times rescheduled) exit of the UK from the EU\u2019s Single Market and Customs Union on 31st December 2020. In the intervening years, many potential scenarios on the degree of continued trade links were considered and a wide literature on the potential impacts of Brexit emerged. These covered the impacts on the UK, the EU as a whole, individual member states and specific sectors. The immediate impact of the uncertainty induced by the referendum on economic outcomes led to negative impacts on investment and exports during the period before the UK official exit from the EU.",
        "The second reason for divergence in the estimated effects of Brexit is the difference in data sources. The exit of the UK from the EU Single Market resulted in data collection changes, which caused a noticeable discrepancy in values that EU and UK statistical agencies report for the same trade flow. We find that collection methods for bilateral EU\u2013UK trade changed less in the UK-reported data than in the EU-reported data. Therefore, we suggest the most accurate estimation of the impact of Brexit can be found by combining EU data for its trade with the rest of the world (to obtain the comparison group) with UK data as the source for bilateral UK\u2013EU trade. Using this \u2018hybrid\u2019 dataset, we find that Brexit has substantially reduced trade in both directions relative to the no-Brexit benchmark. In our baseline model, UK to EU trade declined by 16% and trade from EU to UK by 24%. We further examine the variation across member states, product types, time horizons and role of extensive and intensive margin.\nThe paper is organised as follows: Section 2 gives a descriptive overview of the evolution of UK trade with the EU and rest of the world before and Brexit. Section 3 goes into detail on data and measurement issues. Section 4 describes the methodology and presents the initial estimations from the separate EU-reported and UK-reported data. It then discusses the key reasons why they give different results. In Section 5 we show our baseline estimates of the impacts of Brexit on trade between the UK and the EU using the hybrid dataset. We examine the effects on aggregate EU trade and on member states and discuss some robustness checks. Section 6 examines how the results vary across sectors, time and also by intensive and extensive margins of trade. Section 7 concludes.\n## Descriptive evidence on the evolution of UK\u2013EU and UK-RoW trade",
        "In this section, we set the scene for our analysis by presenting some descriptive patterns of trade both bilaterally between the EU and UK before and after Brexit and also how the trade of both economies with the rest of the world grew in the same period. Two aspects of this are particularly important. The first is the percentage of total trade accounted for by each economy in the other\u2019s aggregate international trade, which will influence the overall economic importance of any shock to\nThis section describes the EU and UK trade data and discusses some changes in methodology that occurred at the same time as the UK exit from the EU.\nThe baseline specification is to estimate the following: where represents trade flows into and out of (either the EU27 total or a specific member country), to each partner country of product in month . is a dummy equal to one for each month following the referendum (from July 2016 onwards), including 2021. is a dummy variable equal to one for each month following the exit of the UK from the EU (i.e. from\n## Estimates of Brexit using a hybrid dataset\nHaving established that both data differences and choice of comparison group contribute to the divergent results, how substantial is the effect on our estimated baseline coefficients?

        "Brexit introduced a major policy shift with respect to UK-EU trade relations and, by extension, non-EU relations. Given the importance of the EU market for UK goods and services, this shift was expected to impact UK economic performance in several areas. Portes () summarizes the evidence of this effect on three dimensions (trade, immigration, and investment). He concludes that UK trade has negatively suffered, consistent with predictions; that the impact on immigration has been much less negative than expected due to a sharp rise in immigration from outside the EU which has compensated, to some degree, the reduced immigration from the EU; and that the impact on investment has been somewhat more negative than expected. In addition to its impact on UK-EU trade, Brexit also affected trade between the UK and non-EU countries as agreements between the EU and third parties ceased to apply to the UK on exit. The effect of Brexit, though, is unlikely to be uniform both across sectors and across the many EU and non-EU countries that the UK trades with. For example, Portes and Springford () suggest that while there is some shortfall in migration for work, the impacts differ considerably between sectors. Bailey et al. () assert that the introduction of non-tariff barriers arising from Brexit has been particularly more challenging for smaller firms in the manufacturing supply chain.",
        "Brexit was a major change in the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU. Dhingra et al. () consider Brexit as the largest change in the UK\u2019s relationships globally in over half a century. It was inevitable that the exit process would be disruptive for several reasons. Firstly, disentangling decades of economic as well as institutional integration was bound to be challenging. In addition, it was not clear (until several years after the vote) what type of trade deal the UK and EU would be able to strike and implement post-Brexit. While trade rules would not change for several years after the vote, it was clear that Brexit would eventually introduce a new trade environment in the UK-EU relationship in the form of tariff and non-tariff barriers (or in the best-case scenario, non-tariff barriers only). Furthermore, the exit process was fraught with delays, ultimately culminating in the establishment of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) signed in December 2020. The TCA came into force in January 2021, reflecting the post-Brexit environment. Secondly, the UK was an economically important member of the EU. In 2016, the UK\u2019s contribution to the EU\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) stood at 16%, ranking second after Germany which contributed 21.1% to the EU\u2019s GDP, and just ahead of France which contributed 15% (Eurostat ). In 2015, a year before Brexit, 44% of UK exports of goods and services went to the EU, while 53% of UK imports came from the EU (ONS ). Since then, these ratios have gradually reduced. In 2022, about 42% of UK exports of goods and services went to the EU, and 48% of UK imports came from the EU (Ward and Webb ).",
        "Brexit is expected to have different impacts on UK trade with different countries. This heterogeneity across countries warrants analysis. With the UK out of the EU, a significant number of new trade negotiations will be at the bilateral level. Therefore, it is useful to understand the impact Brexit has had on UK trade with some of its key trading partners. This is a line of inquiry that is still faced with a paucity of literature. To help fill this gap, this study aims to assess the effect of Brexit on bilateral trade between the UK and EU member countries, as well as between the UK and key non-EU trading partners. Hence, unlike Kren and Lawless (), we enhance the bilateral effect analysis to also cover non-EU countries as well as EU countries with an extended dataset up to 2022Q3. The main question addressed in this study is how the change in the trade environment due to Brexit impacted UK trade with EU member countries and with major non-EU trading partners. While the Brexit vote happened in 2016, there was no change in trade rules until 2021. Therefore, technically, the underlying trade frictions had not changed in practice for most of the duration of this study. In any case, the focus of the current study is not to extract measures of trade frictions or border effects, but to show the differences in trade between pre-vote and post-vote regimes. By treating Brexit as a policy change, this study follows a long list of research that used this approach (use a variety of policy change dummies) to capture the effect of trade policy changes \u2013 for example, integration changes, such as monetary unions, or regional trade agreements (e.g., Dursun ; Micco, Stein, and Ordo\u00f1ez ; Brouwer, Paap, and Viaene ; among others). In this regard, we look at Brexit as a (dis)integration policy move"

        "In this paper, we assess the impact of the 2016 Brexit referendum itself and the introduction of the TCA on the geography of UK trade. Specifically, we examine the impact on trade between the United Kingdom and the 27 EU Member States with monthly data up to December 2021. We do so comparing UK\u2013EU trade to other trade flows as detailed in the methodological section. Estimation of the impacts of the TCA effect is made challenging by two concurring issues: the Covid-19 pandemic which disrupted economies and the sharp rise in shipping cost \u2013 which were also in large part a consequence of Covid-19. Similarly, the analysis of the effect of the referendum might be affected by other confounders. In order to isolate the impact of the referendum and of the TCA from other forces we apply a series of econometric techniques, which are difference-in-differences (DD), triple difference (DDD) and synthetic control (SC). In our principal regressions, we use total trade flows. It is possible that Covid may have had different impacts on different countries\u2019 trade; there may have been a differential impact on trade in Covid-related products which thus affects our aggregate regressions and/or Covid may have impacted differentially across sectors also affecting our aggregate regression. As discussed in Section 2 on the empirical strategy, we control and test for each of these possibilities.\nIt is important to note that in this paper we do not examine the impact on total UK trade to all destinations. Our focus is on UK trade with the EU. This is because, , if Brexit were to impact on trade, in the first instance we would expect this to impact on relative trade with the EU. Nevertheless, the aggregate trade effects are clearly of interest.",
        "As an EU Member State, the United Kingdom was part of the EU\u2019s Customs Union and part of the EU Single Market. The Single Market applies to countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Leaving the EU entailed a departure from each of these for the United Kingdom, but differentially for Great Britain and for Northern Ireland. Hence, Great Britain left both the Customs Union and the Single Market. In contrast, Northern Ireland remains in the EU\u2019s Single Market for goods, but not for services, and while not part of the Customs Union, remains part of the EU\u2019s common customs territory. The departure from the Customs Union and the Single Market has impacted the degree of market access between the United Kingdom and the EU (and the United Kingdom and third countries) in different ways. The changes in market access and the increase in firms\u2019 costs thus involve a combination of tariff barriers, administrative barriers and regulatory barriers.\nDeparture from the Customs Union means that the United Kingdom is free to set its own most favoured nation (MFN) tariffs on imported goods and is able to sign free trade agreements with third countries. The UK\u2019s MFN tariff was established in May 2020 and is commonly referred to as the UK Global Tariff (UKGT). To date, the United Kingdom has also managed to sign new free trade agreements with the EU (2021), Japan (2020), Australia (2022) and New Zealand (2022). The United Kingdom has also signed a series of \u2018continuity agreements\u2019 with those countries which have a free trade agreement with the EU, and consequently as did the United Kingdom when it was a member of the EU. The aim of the continuity agreements is to replicate as closely as possible the previous arrangements.",
        "The departure of the United Kingdom from the EU, as a process of trade policy \u2018disintegration\u2019 is a somewhat unprecedented policy change, which thus limits the existing relevant empirical literature. Regarding the possible impact on the United Kingdom, there is small literature on the impact of the Brexit referendum on the UK\u2013EU trade, mostly focusing on the effect of uncertainty. show that firms\u2019 entry into exporting to the EU was reduced in the first 6 months after the referendum as a consequence of an MFN tariff threat. use odds from the betting market to track the evolution of the Brexit referendum uncertainty over time, and show that the MFN threat started to affect the UK\u2013EU trade even before the referendum of June 2016. Looking at aggregate bilateral trade between the United Kingdom and 14 EU Member States, apply the SC method and find that the UK\u2013EU trade started to decline after the 2015 general election won by the Conservative party. look at the response of Portuguese exporters to the United Kingdom following the 2016 referendum. Comparing firm-level exports with the United Kingdom and other destinations, the authors find a decrease in export prices and volumes to the United Kingdom after the referendum, with heterogeneous effects along exporters and products. Work by using a large data set from a major UK retailer finds that following Brexit there was a switch of demand by UK consumers, with a 6% increase towards UK-produced goods, and a reduction of 13% away from EU goods."

        "Although the benefits of foreign direct investment (FDI) are well established in the economic literature, there remains a dearth of analysis of its impact within the European integration experience. Inward FDI is a major contributor to the diffusion of managerial best practices (Bloom et al 2012). It increases competition and shores up technological innovation (Alfaro et al 2004, Dhingra et al 2016). Also it should be more resilient than other international capital flows. Yet the literature estimating the FDI premium from EU membership remains scarce. European integration may have played a significant role and we need to get a good grasp of its effects.\nAnother reason to examine this issue is the comparison between the trade and the FDI impact of deep economic integration, of which the European integration experience is a textbook example. Focusing exclusively on trade, Glick and Rose (2016) find that earlier estimates of the effect of currency unions vanish when estimated using modern econometric techniques. Most of these techniques became standard after they published their original paper (Glick and Rose 2002). We ask whether the use of modern econometric techniques eliminates the effects of EU membership on FDI. We find that it does not, .\nFigure 1 shows FDI net inflows for the three largest economies in the EU. The UK is by far the largest recipient. Net FDI inflows were small until the mid-1990s but exhibit two periods of rapid expansion \u2013 one in the second half of the 1990s and the other between the dot-com bubble and the financial crisis. It is also worth noting that these flows are much more volatile than expected, which may reflect the increasing share of more \u2018footloose\u2019 service activities, especially finance.",
        "This column reports new estimates of the FDI premium from EU membership. We find that, between 1985 and 2013, EU membership increased FDI inflows by 28% (Bruno et al. 2016). This is a large, significant, and memorable effect \u2013 a percentage point for each of the 28 EU members. Our estimates for the FDI premium are robust and they range from 14% (Heckman) to 33% (OLS) to 38% (Poisson estimates). They survive the Glick-Rose critique and do so comfortably. However, and more importantly, they help advocate for FDI as a channel (in addition to trade) for delivering substantial payoffs from deep integration.\n. Foreign direct investment in France, Germany and the UK, 1970-2014 (net inflows, BoP, current US$)\n: World Bank World Development Indicators 2015.\nThe gravity model has been a staple of international economics. It explains bilateral cross-border flows (trade, migration, investment, etc) based on the relative size and distance between countries or regions (Baldwin and Taglioni 2011, Head and Mayer 2014). A country\u2019s economic size is expected to have a positive effect on bilateral flows while distance is expected to have a negative effect (distance is often taken to reflect a whole range of trade costs including language, bureaucracy, culture, etc). The last two decades have witnessed enormous progress in this area. Among many influential pieces, Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) and Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) are the crucial ones for our purposes. This new structural gravity approach (Fally 2015) provides needed theoretical underpinnings as well as strong support for the econometric estimation of gravity models. \nIn Bruno et al. (2016), we estimate the impact of EU membership on FDI. We used the latest available data on bilateral FDI flows, GDP and GDP per capita (sender and target), bilateral distance and the shares of manufacturing output, exports and imports in total GDP.",
        "How does our 28% estimate compare with and relate to other estimates in the literature? Straathof et al. (2008) use a gravity model to examine bilateral FDI stocks. One of their specifications uses dyadic fixed effects, a somewhat different set of controls and earlier data (1981-2005). They find that EU membership yields a 28% increase in its inward FDI stocks from other EU countries and a 14% increase from non-EU countries (their Table 5.1, column 2). Bevan and Estrin (2004) focus on the new EU member states and show that even the announcement of start of EU membership negotiations has a positive and significant effect on FDI inflows. We can also look at the bilateral trade flows literature for a comparison, but we need to bear in mind that we focus on bilateral FDI in our model. Baier et al. (2008) find that trade is increased by about 130% after 10 to 15 years of EU membership, while the similar impact of EFTA membership is about 35%. We find instead that EU membership increases FDI inflows by about 28% in a country that is a member of the EU, which may be because trade is easier to adjust than FDI flows. This may help further our understanding of how benefits from deep integration actually take root (Campos et al. 2015).\nHow much additional FDI does a country receive as a consequence of being a member of the EU? This is obviously an important question for which, surprisingly, one still finds very few answers. We find EU membership robustly increases net FDI inflows. Our three main estimates range between 14% and 38% depending on the choice of econometric technique. The average of these is 28%. This is a large, robust, significant, substantial, and memorable benefit \u2013 a percentage point for each of the 28 members of the EU. Moreover, this result has enormous implications for the European integration project and for countries, like the UK, that are currently considering substantial changes to the terms of their relationship with the EU."

Investment is volatile, and to a great extent, its performance is more difficult to grasp than trade ([Fern\u00e1ndez-Pacheco Theurer et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999324001846#bib28)); however, the potential emergence of restrictions on cross-border investment due to Brexit suggests that the total cost of leaving the  (EU) is likely to be larger than previous estimations based only on trade. Therefore, this paper analyses the impact of Brexit, considering barriers to trade and the role of FDI. Our results suggest that including FDI considerably worsens the adverse effects of trade caused by Brexit.",
        "In contrast, the , and have estimated the potential impact on FDI of leaving the EU. estimates comprise different ranges of FDI reductions. According to its 3 alternative scenarios, the UK would face a fall in FDI flows by 10% under the European Economic Area membership, between \u221215% and \u221220% under an FTA with the EU or a reduction between 18% and 26% in the \u2018no deal\u2019 case. These results have been used to model the overall macro-economic impact of leaving the EU. calculate that the FDI stock would decrease by 34%. Conversely, predict a 22% decrease in FDI inflows in the UK after leaving the EU.\nThe empirical studies analysing and FDI find a positive relationship. This result is typical in economic integration processes, in general, but seems to be even more pronounced in the case of EU integration, and it is also confirmed by studies focusing on Brexit. Most studies cited above focus on estimating the size of the reduction in FDI stock or flows but did not evaluate its resulting impact, which is the focus of our paper.\nThe few papers which estimate the impact of a reduction on FDI in the UK after Brexit include the analysis of Dhingra et al., 2017, , , , , and .\nDhingra et al., 2017 and evaluate the impact of FDI flow reductions in the UK. The former uses the average of the estimations of the impact of EU membership on FDI in the UK calculated by several authors (; ; ), while the latter use the estimations of .",
        "Several studies have assessed the impact of regional integration on the flows or stocks of FDI. Overall, they find that regional integration affects FDI entry positively. find evidence that a regional integration agreement (such as the EU membership) would increase the stock of FDI by around 27%.  estimates that a reduction of 20% in regulatory differences increases FDI inflows by 15% and suggests that belonging to the EU single market can have an additional positive impact on FDI flows beyond the effects of traditional agreements (FTAs). This postulation makes sense, given that the EU is the world's most integrated economic area (i.e. with the lowest regulatory barriers across different countries).\nFurther studies focus on the impact of the on FDI flows. For example,  examine the impact of EU membership on the Central and Eastern European economies. They find that key announcements around EU accession increased FDI inflow to the applicant countries. found that FDI to Spain expanded due to its EU accession and was crucial in promoting productivity growth. and found that the inward FDI in Spain and Portugal increased significantly after accessing the EU in 1986. Similar results were found for the UK, Ireland, Spain and Sweden (). also confirm the increase in FDI inflows for the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden. FDI inflows seem to rise when a country becomes part of the EU.  estimate the impact of a potential enlargement of the European (EMU) to the 10 countries that obtained EU membership in 2004. They estimate that the FDI inflow would rise by around 21%."

        "When it comes to letterbox firms, systemic risk would decline if UK firms moved more substance to the continent, and an EU-UK agreement could pave the way for improvements. It is not in UK supervisors\u2019 interest to allow cross-border fragility to pile up. A stronger and safer market will encourage growth, offsetting any initial shifts in business.\nSupervisors also need new ways to manage Brexit-related fragmentation of investment-firm oversight. Luxembourg harbours around \u20ac5.5 trillion in assets under management \u2013 more than the UK and almost double the size of what is held Germany or France. Yet many asset management firms in Luxembourg delegate portfolio management. There is a concern that these firms are mainly \u2018letterbox entities\u2019, with minimal presence in Luxembourg and real decision-making, risk management and other functions carried out in London. This could undermine proper oversight, as firms might have incentive to seek out low-regulation entry points into the EU while conducting real operations elsewhere. It does not help the UK to have its firms seeking out laxer rules for their cross-border business. A high-level agreement on common standards and manageable compliance burdens could help both sides.\nAs tensions recede, it is worth exploring how London could better serve as a hub for foreign direct investment into the EU. The UK is second overall, after the United States, representing 25 percent of all acquisitions and 21 percent of greenfield projects in the single market (European Commission, 2024). After Brexit, total FDI levels from the UK into the EU dropped by about one quarter, although the extent to which other jurisdictions may have stepped in is unclear, as some inflows originated from London-based non-UK firms. In any case, the UK can act as a single point of entry for many global firms into the EU, and the EU should welcome such investment."

        "The initial literature that examined the potential effect on FDI flows on a country's accession to a customs union essentially extended the well-understood concepts of \u2018trade creation\u2019 and \u2018trade diversion\u2019 to the issue of FDI. This then makes a series of predictions concerning both FDI flows into a country from outside the customs union, and also regarding intraunion FDI. Much of the analysis that seeks to link FDI decisions of firms to country level decisions regarding economic integration is based on the analysis of Rowthorn ().\nThese can be summarized as follows: firstly, that a country's membership of a customs union makes it more attractive for inward investment from outside the region (Collie, ), with a general increase in \u2018interbloc\u2019 FDI (Donnenfeld, ). This is in turn related to the \u2018optimal tariff\u2019 literature; see for example Blonigen and Cole (), who applied the model of Blanchard () to the case of Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization. Theoretically, one could adopt a similar analysis to the case of Brexit, concluding that the UK may seek to attract \u2018tariff jumping\u2019 FDI at the expense of the EU. This is, however, not a position that those advocating Brexit have yet adopted, for fear that retaliation from the EU would cause a reduction in FDI to the UK from outside the EU. Bajo-Rubio and L\u00f3pez-Pueyo () for example argued that Spain became more attractive for non-EU inward investment as the EU moved towards the single market in 1992.",
        "Since the outcome on the UK's exit (\u2018Brexit\u2019) from the European Union (EU) referendum there has been much comment on the likely nature of the UK's trading relationship with the EU and the rest of the world. However, despite its importance to the UK economy, the effect on inward foreign direct investment (FDI) received little comment during the referendum debate, and only more recently have the positions of, for example, the Japanese car makers in the UK been the focus of attention. This is despite the fact that the UK has been for 40 years not merely open to inward investment but has actively sought foreign investment across all sectors. Many UK and non-UK firms have taken the opportunity to develop supply chains that cross into and out of the UK several times. The position of these firms, and the capacity for the UK to continue to attract inward FDI, is potentially one of the most important economic aspects of the UK's leaving the EU.\nIt is well known that the UK has a long running trade deficit, but what has received much less attention is the extent to which the adverse long-term effects of this have been offset by the quantity of inward FDI that the UK attracts. Hitherto, any analysis of the likely effect of Brexit in terms of firm location decisions has focused on seeking to explore the extent to which such decisions have historically been influenced by the UK's membership of the EU. A more targeted approach would be to explore the short and long-term dynamics of FDI into the UK, and to use them to infer the implications of Brexit. This is the approach that we propose. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to explore the likely effect on inward investment of Brexit, with a particular focus on distinguishing between the long-term drivers of inward investment into the UK, and the effect of short-term volatility.",
        "Even more interestingly, Brexit raises a more general issue that the literature on FDI has yet to address. In particular, there has been a plethora of papers focusing on the effect of joining a free-trade area or a customs union and especially the EU; still, we know surprisingly little about a reverse move, leaving a free-trade area or a customs union, since the noteworthy instances are too few to draw even speculative conclusions. (The Seychelles and Madagascar left the Southern African Development Community for a period, and membership of the Central European Free Trade Agreement when a country joins the EU. To the best of our knowledge these are the only examples of countries leaving a customs union.) The naive approach, which was sometimes offered by politicians in the run up to the referendum and indeed by some for the 12 months up to the 2017 UK general election but dismissed almost unanimously by policy makers, academics and the popular press, would be simply to assume that the effect on FDI would simply be zero, with new opportunities offsetting any detrimental effects. And yet, what may happen to (inward) FDI is more than an important concern; it is a centrepiece economic criterion to make a decision to remain or not in a free-trade area or a customs union. Given that the country that considers such a move is the UK, and that the union that it involves is the EU, having a framework to study how FDI could possibly react to such an event is as timely an issue as it can ever be."

        "This increased support for a different kind of relationship with the EU seems to be mostly driven by the changing attitudes among some 2016 Leavers, who appear to have become more unsure about the effects of Brexit. Within the next ten to 15 years, nearly one in five Leave voters (18 per cent) would either like the UK to re-join the EU or the single market and a further 45 per cent would like to see a closer relationship or see the UK in a new kind of association with the EU.\nIn considering what these findings mean for future government policy and the UK\u2019s post-Brexit relationship with the EU, we suggest that:\n  * There is a need for Britain\u2019s political leaders to openly acknowledge the immediate consequences of Brexit and set out a plan to fix them. A substantial majority of the public, including Leave voters, think that Brexit has had a negative impact on their lives \u2013 and there is no political prize for shying away from the conversation about the costs of Brexit to date.\n  * Little public support exists for deregulation away from high standards in the pursuit of future trade deals. The British public overwhelmingly supports high standards on the environment, labour and social rights and food safety, even at the cost of not striking major trade agreements, suggesting that any deregulation agenda that lowers current protections will have extraordinarily low levels of public support.\n  * The British public is more pragmatic on Europe than is often portrayed by politicians and the media. While the public does simply want to move on from debating Brexit, the data show that voters tend to evaluate the trade-offs inherent in different choices in a pragmatic way. The public deserves honesty and transparency from political leaders about what consequences future choices will entail.",

        "Barely one-fifth of respondents across the four biggest EU members, from 19% in Italy and to 21% in Spain and 22% in Germany, felt the UK should be allowed to return to the bloc on those terms, with 58-62% saying it must be part of all main EU policy areas.\nThe pollster stress-tested western European attitudes by asking whether, if the UK was only willing to rejoin the EU on condition it could keep its old opt-outs, it should be allowed to. Some (33-36%) felt this would be acceptable, but more (41-52%) were opposed.\nIn the UK, while 54% of Britons supported rejoining the EU when asked the question in isolation, the figure fell to just 36% if rejoining meant giving up previous opt-outs. On those terms, 45% of Britons opposed renewed membership.\nThe survey found that remain voters and those who backed more pro-EU parties would still broadly back rejoining if this meant adopting the euro and being part of the Schengen area, albeit at much lower rates.\nAlmost 60% of remain voters said they would support rejoining the EU without the previous opt-outs, down about 25 percentage points from the non-specific question, as would 58% of Labour voters (-23 points) and 49% of Liberal Democrats (-31 points).\nThe percentage of Eurosceptic voters willing to rejoin without the previous special treatment more or less halved, falling from 21% to 10% among leave voters; 25% to 12% among Conservative voters, and 15% to 9% among Reform UK supporters.\nThe fifth continental European country polled, Denmark, proved an outlier. Respondents there were very keen (72%) for the UK to rejoin, and more enthusiastic than larger member states about it keeping its previous opt-outs (43%).\nDenmark, however, is one of only three EU member states to hold opt-outs in major EU policy areas.

        "This does not mean that a Europeanised UK is destined to rejoin the EU. It would more than likely take another critical juncture to break the path dependence of the TCA\u2019s hard Brexit. Further, while the UK has engaged with European multilateralism, a distance has remained with the EU. The war in Ukraine has reminded British policy makers that the UK has withdrawn from the EU but not from Europe. But that has meant a focus on relations with European states through NATO (as discussed by Cladi) and, at some remove, with the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (Grogan ). It has also entailed a lot of muddling through in building links, especially bilateral ones, so as to avoid any formal UK-EU institutional setup on foreign policy coordination. The 2021 reflected this tone, making only a passing mention of the EU. This is not a sign of the EU\u2019s lack of importance to the UK\u2019s international relations; it is, rather, a sign of how such documents are drafted with political sensitivities in mind with geopolitics placed second. The 2015 UK also said very little about the EU, despite it being published shortly after the election of a government with a commitment to put to the British people one of the biggest foreign policy choices since 1945. That the EU remains the UK\u2019s most important multilateral relationship means the potential exists for closer UK-EU relations, but many decision makers remain uneasy at accepting this."

        "report": "**Report: Should the United Kingdom Rejoin the European Union?**\n\n---\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nSince the 2016 referendum, the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) exit from the European Union (EU) has reshaped its political framework, economic relationships, and social identity. Nearly a decade later, debate continues over whether rejoining the EU would better serve the UK\u2019s national interests. This report assesses the merits of potential reaccession by integrating analysis of **political**, **economic**, and **social-strategic** implications. Drawing from the findings of three detailed sub-studies, the report examines how EU membership would affect sovereignty, governance, economic performance, national cohesion, and global influence.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Political Implications**\n\nRejoining the EU would recalibrate the UK\u2019s political structure and multilevel governance relationships. Politically, membership would reintroduce the primacy of EU law, curtailing absolute Westminster sovereignty but granting Britain representation within EU decision-making bodies such as the Parliament, Commission, and Council [Child 1]. This shift represents a trade-off between autonomy and participation: while the UK would again need to align with EU law\u2014including free movement and Single Market regulations\u2014it would regain internal influence over European policies rather than functioning as an external rule-taker [Child 1].\n\nDomestically, renewed membership could stabilize constitutional tensions among devolved governments by restoring frameworks for cooperative policymaking. In Scotland, this step may undercut pro-independence arguments tied to EU re-entry, while in Northern Ireland, alignment with EU regulatory norms could ease border management and reinforce the peace process [Child 1]. However, Euroskeptic sentiment and divisions over sovereignty would likely persist among segments of the electorate.\n\nIn global governance terms, rejoining would re-embed the UK within a multilateral bloc capable of shaping joint policies on trade, security, and climate issues. While sovereignty would be shared, Britain\u2019s ability to influence regional decisions would rise compared to its current position outside the Union [Child 1].\n\n---\n\n### **2. Economic Implications**\n\nEconomically, the implications of rejoining are largely positive. Integration into the **Single Market** and **Customs Union** would restore frictionless trade\u2014eliminating tariffs, quotas, and most regulatory barriers\u2014thus revitalizing supply chains and reducing compliance costs [Child 2]. This reintegration would improve competitiveness in major sectors like manufacturing, finance, and logistics, while restoring investor confidence and access to European markets.\n\nEvidence suggests foreign direct investment (FDI) could rise by **14\u201338%** relative to post-Brexit levels due to renewed stability and predictable regulation [Child 2]. The UK would again serve as a key gateway for global investors entering Europe. Restoring free movement would further alleviate labor shortages in critical industries, although it would also limit control over immigration policy.\n\nMacroeconomically, rejoining is projected to yield measurable gains in productivity and GDP growth through enhanced market access, capital flows, and workforce mobility. These benefits would offset the loss of unilateral trade policy autonomy and the fiscal costs of EU membership contributions [Child 2]. In sum, the economic evidence indicates strong long-term benefits from rejoining, with the balance of costs favoring renewed integration.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Social and Strategic Implications**\n\nSocially, rejoining the EU would reknit ties between the UK and broader European society. Cultural and educational exchanges would expand through restored participation in programs such as Erasmus-style initiatives, science collaborations, and cross-border mobility schemes [Child 3]. A renewal of shared European identity may reduce the social polarization triggered by Brexit, fostering a more pragmatic and outward-facing political climate [Child 3].\n\nStrategically, EU reentry would reinforce the UK\u2019s international standing within Western alliances. Membership would deepen coordination within EU diplomatic and security frameworks while complementing its NATO role. The UK would once again help shape European policies on defense, trade, and energy security from within rather than negotiating from the outside [Child 3]. This alignment would elevate its influence in global discourse and enhance its capacity to manage regional security and economic shocks collectively.\n\nTogether, these social and strategic outcomes suggest that rejoining could strengthen both internal cohesion and external projection of power, aligning civic unity with diplomatic leverage.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Integrated Evaluation**\n\nAcross political, economic, and social dimensions, EU re-accession presents a complex balance of costs and advantages. Politically, sovereignty would be pooled rather than restored to full independence; however, influence within a major bloc and stabilization of internal political strains could yield net governance gains [Child 1]. Economically, evidence points decisively toward benefits in trade, investment, and labor dynamics, providing substantial relief to industries and regions strained by post-Brexit barriers [Child 2]. Socially, renewed European engagement could soften polarization, restore identity coherence, and reposition the UK as a cooperative rather than insular power [Child 3].\n\nThe key trade-off lies between symbolic sovereignty and pragmatic advantages. While rejoining entails partial regulatory alignment and fiscal contributions, it would restore enabling conditions for prosperity, influence, and cohesion. The feasibility of re-accession would, however, depend on domestic political will and the EU\u2019s readiness to readmit the UK under potentially revised terms.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the integrated findings, the evidence collectively supports the argument that **the United Kingdom should seriously consider rejoining the European Union**, provided political conditions permit. The economic gains, diplomatic renewal, and social stabilization that accompany membership outweigh the sovereignty-related costs identified across the analyses [Child 1][Child 2][Child 3].  \n\nRejoining would not merely reverse Brexit\u2014it would represent a recalibration of Britain\u2019s identity and strategy toward collaborative governance. That decision, however, remains contingent on domestic consensus and careful negotiation to ensure alignment between national priorities and European frameworks.\n\n---\n\n**Citations:** [Child 1][Child 2][Child 3]",

              "The of 2016 suggests that such votes might not go as polling suggests. In such a scenario, Leave parties might have lost the preceding general election, but they would still have considerable resources and activists to push a message that would inevitably revolve around how politicians want to overturn the 2016 decision.\nThe ability of campaigners to get voters to actually vote would be more constrained in any new vote, as they will face the additional hurdle of explaining why the public need to return to an issue that was supposedly settled only a few years ago. The legitimacy of a rejoin majority but with fewer votes than Leave last time would open a new point of attack from those who wanted to fight it.\nAt which point we run into the elephant in the room: rejoining isn\u2019t just up to the UK.\nThe EU holds all the over whether to let a country become a member: rejoining states don\u2019t get any special rights in that regard. Not only do you have to comply with entry requirements on political and economic capacity to manage the effects of membership, but you also have to get the explicit approval of all existing member states and of the European Parliament.\nNone of that is a given.\nAs times passes, the UK is diverging from EU standards. Moreover, as a new applicant the UK would be obliged to commit to being part of those bits of the EU that it used to have opt-outs on, like the Euro, Schengen and various bits of justice and home affairs.\nMember states and the EU Parliament might also have doubts about whether they want the UK back. They might be concerned, for example, that the UK would stymie certain policy agendas, since the UK would once more be getting to vote on things it dislikes (such as, possibly, the package with its debt financing)."

              "Another major pro-EU argument centers on . Inside the EU, the UK had a seat at the table in shaping European-wide decisions that inevitably affect its interests; outside, the UK has found it often must accept or adjust to EU decisions without a voice. Advocates for rejoining argue that Britain\u2019s global influence was amplified by being an EU member. The EU, with its combined economic weight and regulatory power, can set standards (from environmental rules to tech regulation) that smaller individual countries often end up following. As an EU member, the UK was one of the \u201cBig Three\u201d alongside Germany and France, and British diplomats and Members of the European Parliament had significant sway over EU policies. If the UK rejoined, it could once again help steer EU policy on trade, digital regulation, climate change, and more, rather than watching from the outside. This influence is seen as especially important given that many EU rules will affect the UK regardless \u2013 for instance, EU product standards must be met by UK companies exporting to Europe. It would be better to \u201cbe in the room\u201d and shape those rules than to be a rule-taker, proponents say.\nDomestically, rejoining the EU could also ease certain political tensions. For example, it might strengthen the unity of the UK itself. Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in 2016; Brexit has since fueled calls for Scottish independence and complicated governance in Northern Ireland. If the UK as a whole re-enters the EU, the pressure for Scotland to leave the UK in order to rejoin Europe might diminish. Essentially, UK-wide EU membership could remove one of the grievances that separatists cite (Scotland \u201cbeing taken out of the EU against its will\u201d). Some unionists argue this would help \u201ctake the wind out of the sails\u201d of Scottish independence sentiment and thus preserve the UK\u2019s integrity.",
              "Proponents also argue that rejoining would affirm the UK\u2019s commitment to . The EU\u2019s laws on things like food safety (e.g., banning certain additives), environmental law (water quality, air pollution limits), and digital regulation (like the GDPR for data privacy) set a benchmark. Since Brexit, the UK government has considered or enacted changes that diverge \u2013 for example, contemplating lowering food import standards or scrapping some EU-derived worker protections. Those in favor of EU membership worry this could lead to a erosion of standards in the long run (a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d). By rejoining, the UK would recommit to those shared high standards and eliminate the risk of regulatory rollback in areas where the EU leads. Essentially, it future-proofs certain rights and norms by binding the UK into the collective legal commitments of the EU.\nFinally, there\u2019s a constitutional argument: Brexit and its aftermath have been very consuming for the UK\u2019s governance, sparking legal battles (like the 2019 prorogation of Parliament case) and questions about the (Scotland and Northern Ireland\u2019s place in the Union). Some legal scholars in the pro-EU camp argue that rejoining could provide a stable framework for the UK\u2019s internal constitutional arrangements, because the EU\u2019s multilevel governance gives a voice to regions (Scotland and Wales could engage in EU forums) and lessens some conflicts. While this is a more abstract point, the idea is that the EU framework supports the rule of law and pluralism , which aligns with the UK\u2019s own constitutional values.",
              "In summary, legal alignment with the EU is portrayed as beneficial for consistency, rights, and standards. Rejoining would erase the legal fragmentation that Brexit created, making life simpler for businesses and citizens and ensuring that the UK operates under the robust legal regime that governs its neighbors. It would trade a bit of abstract sovereignty for a lot of practical legal cohesion and clout (since the UK would again help shape EU laws via the Council and Parliament).\nOn the global stage, proponents argue that both the UK and Europe as a whole would be geopolitically stronger if the UK rejoins the EU. We live in a time of \u2013 the United States and China are superpowers, Russia is an aggressive regional power, and new blocs are forming. Europe must remain united to assert its interests and values in this environment. A UK inside the EU makes the and creates a bloc of democracies in Europe that is more comparable in weight to the U.S. or China. Geostrategically, a reunited Europe including Britain would command greater respect in trade negotiations, climate negotiations, and in setting international standards."

              "> Effective U.K. autonomy depends more on the complex web of economic, social, and cultural interactions with the rest of the world than it does on the U.K. government\u2019s formal political power.\nEffective U.K. autonomy depends more on the complex web of economic, social, and cultural interactions with the rest of the world than it does on the U.K. government\u2019s formal political power. Those interactions inescapably erode the ability of the UK\u2019s government and citizens to make independent untrammeled decisions. Yes, the UK\u2019s membership in the European Union erodes formal sovereignty. Economic, social, and cultural interrelationships intentionally erode sovereignty. However, because of the cooperative relationships across the English Channel, the UK\u2019s membership in the European Union has on balance rather than eroded effective U.K. autonomy. British skeptics can legitimately argue that the EU Commission and its governments may have adopted excessive regulations. But skeptics cannot argue that those decisions were taken without U.K. participation. Whatever future decisions may be made about Brexit, moreover, many of the existing cooperative relationships with the EU are likely to be maintained\u2014precisely to forestall an unwanted deterioration in effective U.K. autonomy.\nAnti-EU sentiment can question not only whether economic relations with the EU have been conducted appropriately. EU skeptics may logically complain about unwanted immigration from Europe. They may logically assert that EU membership undermines U.K. culture and national identity. It would be unfortunate, however, if most Brits were to favor a Brexit because of superficial yearning for elusive sovereignty.",
              "Think of regulations and oversight about the production and marketing of medications. By agreement of all EU members including the UK, cooperative oversight throughout the EU is typically beneficial. The functions of the European Medicines Agency are to provide such oversight. If an exit-deal Brexit is to occur, cooperative adjustments need to be found to support some form of continuation of the EMA\u2019s oversight. Analogous comments apply to a wide range of issues that affect all members of the European Union. Another example highly important to the U.K. is the design of regulations and oversight for the provision of financial services throughout the EU.\nRegulation and oversight of immigration from Europe is more controversial. Some British residents complain, for example, that the free movement of labour within the EU has led to a surge of Europeans coming into the UK, taking jobs away from locals, flooding the schools with their children, committing crimes. Emotions can run high about threats to national culture and traditional ways of life. In turn the U.K. governments experience strong pressure to reduce the ease of movement of Europeans crossing the U.K. border.\nMost of the difficult issues will require UK-EU cooperation whether or not the U.K. finds itself outside the EU fence. The issue areas had to be addressed in the past while the U.K. was inside the European Union. They will need continued attention even if the U.K. chooses a no-Brexit remain."

Photo: iStock.\n  * The question of sovereignty lies at the heart of the UK\u2019s upcoming EU referendum. Many in Britain believe that the process of EU decision-making has undermined British parliamentary democracy, and that leaving the EU is the only way for the British people to regain control of their sovereignty.\n  * This ignores the fact that successive British governments have chosen to pool aspects of the country\u2019s sovereign power in the EU in order to achieve national objectives that they could not have achieved on their own, such as creating the single market, enlarging the EU, constraining Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, and helping to design an ambitious EU climate change strategy.\n  * Apart from EU immigration, the British government still determines the vast majority of policy over every issue of greatest concern to British voters \u2013 including health, education, pensions, welfare, monetary policy, defence and border security. The arguments for leaving also ignore the fact that the UK controls more than 98 per cent of its public expenditure.\n  * The British economy has prospered in the EU. The UK boasts higher economic growth and lower unemployment than most major developed economies. It attracts the most foreign direct investment in the EU, and is ranked among the most open places to do business in the developed world. British economic weaknesses, such as low growth in productivity, are self-inflicted.",
              "* However, a successful economy and free-movement rules have led to high levels of immigration from the EU. Overall, this has been positive for the UK economy, but it has exacerbated preexisting pressures on public services, may have restricted wage growth in some sectors, and is a source of widespread public concern.\n  * Is it time, therefore, to return economic and political sovereign power entirely to Westminster? The risks of doing so are extensive. For example, the UK would be excluded from the process of EU rule-writing, making it a less attractive location for foreign investment. The UK is unlikely to strike better trade deals alone than it has currently through the EU. And the UK would have no say in the design of more open EU markets for digital, financial and other services. Leaving would also have a destabilizing effect on the rest of the EU, which will remain Britain\u2019s largest market.\n  * In contrast, the main risks to the UK of remaining are political. High levels of immigration from the EU would persist. However, it is inconceivable that the EU will enlarge to include Turkey in the foreseeable future, and the UK and other EU states retain a veto over this decision.\n  * Nor need the UK fear the emergence of a more integrated eurozone, which will continue to feature profound differences in national outlook and is unlikely to enlarge quickly. EU decision-making overall is also becoming more intergovernmental rather than centralized.\n  * Continuing to pool its sovereign power selectively in the EU would enable the UK to help design integrated EU responses to many challenges that it cannot resolve on its own. These include the challenges of energy efficiency and sustainability; energy security; internet governance; and the fight against terrorism.",
              "* In a world that is more interdependent today than it was when the UK joined the European Economic Community in 1973, the notion of \u2018absolute\u2019 British sovereignty is illusory. It is also worthless if it limits the ability of future British governments to ensure the security and prosperity of their citizens. Judging from the UK\u2019s experience and its future prospects, the opportunities from remaining in the EU far outweigh the risks of doing so, and the risks of leaving far outweigh the opportunities."

Even though the UK knew going in that there were , probably few could have predicted in 1972 that the EU would now resemble such a close political union, on the verge of incorporating a federalist structure. Nevertheless, Britain has been a willing\u2014if begrudging\u2014member along the way, ratifying and participating in the European project. And while the Union has certainly been throughout the years, the last decade has brought about its most serious challenges, with the , and the recent EU . With these two ordeals straining the functionality of a closer Union, the Tory government led the UK into a referendum on EU membership that has divided their party, and challenged their commitment to the European project. In February Prime Minister Cameron he thinks will provide Britain more autonomy and prosperity, but by the news media. While the majority of international leaders have the UK to remain in the EU, one vocal supporter stood out from the pack: Barack Obama."

              "Currently, the European Parliament is made up of 751 MEPs who are organised into eight political groups. These are not strictly parties, but rather coalitions between MEPs from different countries with similar ideological outlooks. A minimum of 25 members representing at least one quarter of member states are needed to form a group. Not all MEPs belong to a political group \u2013 these are known as non-attached members. Each MEP serves for a five-year term. The UK elects 73 of those.\nBoth the UK and the EU27 have recognised that delaying the UK\u2019s Brexit date will likely require the UK to hold European Parliament elections.\nThere are three main reasons for this:\n1) EU members states are legally required to hold European Parliament elections. The European Commission could choose to initiate treaty infringement proceedings against the UK for denying UK or EU citizens in the UK the right to vote, or indeed stand, in European Parliament elections. Any attempt to install MEPs without elections could also be subject to challenge in the EU courts.\n2) If the UK decided to remain a member state past July but had not taken part in the EU elections, then the new European Parliament \u2013 without British seats \u2013 would not be able to carry out its activities.\n3) Excluding the UK would require treaty reform, which the EU would find hard to agree at very short notice, not least given the need for ratification by member states.\nHowever, if the UK has ratified the Withdrawal Agreement \u2013 which requires parliamentary approval \u2013 by 22 May, the UK will not need to take part in the elections. If Parliament does not approve a deal by this time and the UK does not hold European Parliament elections, it will have to leave the EU without a deal on 1 June.",
              "In June 2018, the EU decided it would reduce the overall number of seats in the European Parliament after Brexit to 705 (down from 751) and reallocate 27 of the 73 UK seats to other EU countries. The plan was for this distribution to be effective from the next European Parliament. If the UK were to take part, the EU would need to halt this reconfiguration.\nVoting across other member states will take place between 23\u201326 May. Results cannot be announced before 11:00pm Brussels time on 26 May to ensure the results in one country do not prejudice votes in another. New MEPs will take up their seats on 2 July.\nThe EU needs to know by mid-April whether to halt the reconfiguration of seats. On the UK side, the Government has already laid the necessary legislation allowing the UK to take part in the 2019 European Parliament elections on 23 May.\nThe deadline for registered parties submitting the candidates they want to contest the election to the Electoral Commission is 25 April. Individual parties have their own deadlines for candidates applying to run.\nThe UK is divided into 12 regions: nine in England, and one each for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each region has a set number of MEPs, who are elected through proportional representation \u2013 although the method differs between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In England, Scotland and Wales, MEPs are elected using the [D\u2019Hondt system within each region](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27187434). Parties draw up regional lists of candidates which they share with the electorate. The party that wins the most votes can send the candidate at the top of its list to Brussels. The winning party\u2019s vote total is then halved, and the party with the highest tally in the second re-ordered list can send an MEP to Brussels. The process repeats itself until all candidates for the region are appointed.",
              "The 73 British MEPs would cease to be members once the UK has left the EU. It is unclear whether plans for a post-Brexit reconfiguration of the European Parliament would then come into effect before the 2024 European Parliament elections.\nPotentially. In 2014, the EU introduced the (lead candidate) process to select the new President of the EU Commission. This meant that rather than simply emerging from discussion in the Council, EU leaders proposed the lead candidate of the biggest parliamentary grouping as the new president of the Commission. Jean-Claude Juncker was nominated under this process as the lead candidate of the European People\u2019s Party.\nMost parliamentary groupings have already selected their candidates this time: these include German MEP Manfred Weber for the European People\u2019s Party and Frans Timmermans, the Dutch Vice President of the Commission, for the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. No UK MEP would boost the numbers of the European People's Party since the Conservatives left the grouping in 2009, but Labour MEPs would increase the numbers in the Socialists and Democrats. It is possible that this could make a difference to the numbers \u2013 but it is also possible that EU leaders could decide to nominate a candidate from another parliamentary grouping or someone other than a designated \nWhat tariffs has Donald Trump announced \u2013 and what do they mean for the UK? \nEconomic and fiscal forecasts are a critical part of the government budget process.

              "## How do the elections work?\nGreat Britain uses a list system and divides the country into 12 electoral regions, with voters casting a single vote for their preferred party. Northern Ireland uses the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system for its three MEPs, where voters can choose their second and third preferences.\nPolitical parties produce lists of candidates for each region and order the candidates according to who is their first nomination. The \u2018closed list system\u2019 used in the UK means that voters simply cast one vote for the party that they wish to support, and the parties decide in what order their candidates are listed.\nAs parties win seats, those at the top of the lists gain them first. The number of seats each party receives is calculated using the d\u2019Hondt method of proportional representation. The party with the most votes wins the first seat available.\nHowever, once a party has been given a seat, its votes are halved (i.e. divided by the number of seats it has, plus one) and whoever has the most votes after that gets the next seat. If the winning party gets substantially more votes than any other, it could also win the second seat. If that were the case, its total votes would then be divided by the number of seats it has plus one (three in total), and the process continues until all of the seats up for election are distributed.\nDo elections work the same way everywhere in the EU?\nNo. Although the electoral systems used must all be proportional, member states can use different proportional systems. The \u2018closed list system\u2019 used in the UK means that voters simply cast one vote for the party that they wish to support, and the parties decide in what order their candidates are listed. However, a majority of EU countries use a \u2018preferential list system\u2019, allowing voters to cast ballots for both parties and individual candidates. Ireland and Malta use the same \u2018single transferable vote system\u2019 which is used in Northern Ireland.",
              "In most member states (eg. Spain), MEPs are elected to a single, nation-wide constituency. In others, such as the UK, MEPs represent constituencies (one of 12 regions). Minimum age requirements, electoral thresholds, compulsory voting, requirements to stand for election, and the particular date and time of the elections differ across the EU.\nThe European Council has set out how the UK\u2019s seats will be redistributed to other member states should it leave the EU. Of the 73, only 27 will be reallocated, reducing the European Parliament to 705 MEPs in total.\nThe fact Brexit hasn\u2019t happened complicates the elections for those states earmarked to receive extra MEPs. Ireland, for instance, currently elects 11 MEPs, but when the UK leaves it will gain a further two seats. If the UK takes part this time but leaves during the parliament, Ireland and others will have to fill these seats. As a result, Ireland is electing \u2018reserve\u2019 candidates at this election who will take up the extra seats when and if the UK leaves.\nHow are parties organised in the European Parliament?\nUnlike the UK, MEPs sit in cross-national groups that their national parties are affiliated with, largely based around shared political ideologies. For instance, the Conservatives sit with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group and Labour sit with the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) group. These groups tend to vote in blocs in much the same way as political parties do in Westminster.\nAlthough most groups persist from one parliament to the next, new groupings tend to be formed in each five-year term. A group must have at least 25 MEPs from at least seven member states. There were eight political groups in the 2014-19 parliament running across the full spectrum from far-left to far-right. No single group is even close to a majority of seats in the Parliament, so coalition-building is part and parcel of how the Parliament works.\n## Subscribe to the UKICE newsletter"

              "This week\u2019s European Parliament election (22\u201325 May) has several unprecedented features. Most importantly, the main pan-European parties are fielding lead candidates for European Commission President. Turning the election into a presidential horse race was intended to increase electoral participation and enhance the Parliament\u2019s democratic legitimacy, even though it remains to be seen whether voters will actually see things this way.\nCritics often blame European citizens\u2019 relative lack of interest in the European Parliament on its inherent inequality of representation. Voters in smaller member states are overrepresented. Germany\u2019s Federal Constitutional Court, when ruling on the Lisbon Treaty on 30 June 2009, said that the European Parliamentary election process \u2018does not take due account of equality\u2019. In the Court\u2019s view, this constitutes one of two key factors in the European Union\u2019s \u2018structural democratic deficit\u2019, the other being the European Parliament\u2019s \u2018position in the European competence structure\u2019, i.e. its lack of power compared to other EU institutions.\nHow unequal is the representation comparatively? \nIn the Treaty on European Union, government representation in the lower house is based on both a principle of disproportionate electoral weight given to smaller countries, and on binding thresholds of minimum and maximum representation. As a consequence, the European Parliament is at the low end in terms of electoral equality.\n  * One way to measure voter inequality is to look at the \u2018voting Gini coefficient\u2019.\n  * This uses the familiar measure of inequality of income, but applies it to European Parliament voting power per voter.",
              "Figure 1 shows the Gini coefficients for the European Parliament (EP) and that of several other parliaments. Voting power in the EP is outside the norm of individual European countries in terms of equality of representation. Germany, whose professed commitment to this principle is unparalleled among countries reviewed, is at the other end of the spectrum. Indeed, the European Parliament is at the low end in terms of electoral equality even beyond Europe.\n. Voting Gini coefficients\nHigher levels of inequality of representation may be expected in larger, more diverse polities where the political complexity of federal arrangements leads to awkward institutional compromises, which is definitely the case of the EU. In our sample, high voting Gini coefficients are indeed also observed for the lower houses in India and Brazil, which come closest to the EP on that measure. For example, in Brazil voters from Sao Paulo state are notoriously underrepresented. Yet the US and Indonesia, which are also large and diverse, both display comparatively low voting Gini coefficients.\nHow much change would produce an acceptable level of equality of representation? \nRead in a different light, Figure 1 suggests that the European Parliament would not need to go all the way to representative equality as high as the German Bundestag to join the norm of lower chambers in democratic polities. This is important, since a modified distribution of seats that reduced the voting Gini coefficient to something like 10% could be achieved without entirely renouncing the Treaty principle of \u2018degressive proportionality\u2019 as currently implemented by the European Council. It would, however, require lowering the minimum of six MEP seats per member state, and thus a modification of the Treaty on European Union.",
              "The EU Treaties stipulate that \u2018Representation of citizens should be degressively proportional, with a minimum threshold of six members [of the European Parliament] per Member State. No Member State shall be allocated more than ninety-six seats\u2019 (Article 14(2) of the Treaty on European Union). The ratio between the maximum and minimum (96/6) is 16 to 1, while the ratio between voting-age populations of the largest and smallest members (Germany and Luxembourg, respectively) is more than 172 to 1. However, no specific formula for representation is provided, and the exact composition is to be adopted by unanimous decision of the European Council. The latest apportionment decision was adopted in June 2013, in the run-up to the accession of Croatia as the EU\u2019s 28th member state.\nFor most countries reviewed, average voting-age population per government representative is based on the total population per relevant territorial subdivision (e.g. state or province), taken from each country\u2019s census bureau, and on the \u2018Voting-Age Population\u2019 (VAP) variable from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA)\u2019s database ()."

              "One of the most intense debates during the 2014 independence referendum was whether or not Scotland could maintain uninterrupted membership of the European Union if it became an independent country. The UK Government argued that the rest of the UK would be the \u2018continuing state\u2019 and would exclusively retain the rights and obligations of the UK\u2019s current membership. Consequently, Scotland would have to apply afresh to become an EU member after becoming independent. The Scottish Government, in contrast, took the view that as Scotland would already be fully compliant with the requirements of EU membership, there was every reason to believe the country would be able seamlessly to become an EU member in its own right.",
              "Of course, just two years after Scotland voted by 55% to 45% to remain inside the UK, the UK as a whole \u2013 though not Scotland itself \u2013 voted to Leave the EU. Eventually, after some years of political turmoil, the UK formally left the political institutions at the end of January 2020, while it exited the single market and customs union at the end of that year. As a result, the debate that was held in 2014 on the implications of independence for Scotland\u2019s membership of the EU has been overtaken by events. Perhaps, then, it was not entirely surprising that after it became clear that the UK was heading for a relatively \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit, in March 2017, just two and a half years after the original ballot, the then First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, called for a second independence referendum. That call has, of course, not been answered. But Brexit does mean that, unless there is a change in the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU, the choice with which Scotland\u2019s voters would be presented in a second independence referendum would not, as in 2014, simply be whether it should be inside or outside the UK, but, rather, whether it should be in the UK but outside the EU, or inside the EU but outside the UK. Doubtless, once again, part of the debate would be about whether and how easily an independent Scotland would be able to secure EU membership. However, now voters would be being asked whether it would be better for Scotland to seek EU membership rather than retain its current position in the UK.",
              "Moreover, this link between support for the EU and support for independence is underpinned by how people regard the consequences of the choice that Scotland now seems to face in its constitutional debate, that is, between being part of the UK but outside the EU and being part of the EU but outside the UK. On many issues voters are more likely to believe that being in the EU would be better for Scotland than they are to feel that being in the UK would be better \u2013 and these voters are highly likely to say they would vote Yes. However, while the balance of opinion may be more favourable to EU membership rather than being part of the UK, it is still the case that in most instances less than half believe that EU membership would be advantageous. Many are of the view that it would not make much difference and are also seemingly more inclined to stick with the status quo. Meanwhile, although Yes voters appear to have few qualms about signing up to freedom of movement, they are much less ready to embrace the euro, and more broadly the question of what currency an independent Scotland should use remains contentious.\nOf course, in practice little has happened in the debate about Scotland\u2019s constitutional status since the implementation of Brexit. The COVID-19 pandemic prevented any significant discussion of the issue, while more recently the SNP\u2019s political difficulties have left the party unable to make the political weather. As a result, voters have had little exposure to the issues that would arise in the choice between being in the UK and being part of the EU, and we cannot be sure what view they would form when they have heard more about the issues at stake. But what is now clearly the case is that it is a debate that will be crucial to how voters regard Scotland\u2019s constitutional future."

Rather than simply being a question of whether Scotland should be part of the UK, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, framed the choice facing the country as being \u201coutside the UK, but inside the EU\u201d, versus being \u201cinside the UK but outside the EU\u201d. \nIn short, any future referendum on independence would be as much about Brexit as it would be about Scotland\u2019s relationship with the rest of the UK.\nThis, perhaps, is not surprising.

              "The question of whether Scotland could rejoin the EU if it left the UK was much debated in 2014\u2019s independence referendum (the Yes side said it would, the No campaign that it would not). At that point there did not appear to be a strong link between voters\u2019 attitudes towards the EU and their attitudes towards independence. According to the , 49% of voters with a sceptical outlook towards the EU (that is, they either thought that the UK should leave the EU or that the EU\u2019s powers should be reduced) voted for independence. Only slightly fewer \u2013 44% \u2013 of those who thought the EU should remain at least as powerful as it was voted the same way.\nThis pattern was also reflected in how people in Scotland voted two years later in the EU referendum.

Yet there has always been an element of the party\u2019s support that wished to avoid both the constraints of EU membership, as well as the limitations created by being part of the UK.\n## What has changed since 2016\nAfter the Brexit referendum, some voters began to reassess their attitudes towards independence in light of the decision to leave the EU. As the SNP anticipated, some who had voted No in 2014 and Remain in 2016 switched to backing independence. But these were counterbalanced by some who had voted Yes in 2014 but Leave in 2016, switching in the opposite direction to support Scotland remaining in the UK."

But it\u2019s also raised the issue, again, of Scottish independence, not least because a very comfortable majority, 62 percent, within Scotland voted for the U.K. to remain within the European Union.

And you\u2019re absolutely right that developments in Northern Ireland and in Ireland, actually, with its relationship with the U.K., now that the U.K. is outside of the internal market, these things are being observed quite closely in Scotland.

              "The success of the Brexit Leave campaign in June 2016 and the subsequent exit process culminating in the EU-UK trade deal, negotiated at the end of 2020, has further heightened the debate in both Scotland and Northern Ireland about their citizens\u2019 preferred territorial status. As of this writing, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement has not prevented business disruption between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK nor between the UK and EU. Considering first the Scottish case, there has been much political discussion about whether Brexit justifies Scotland pursuing another independence bid, and the current governing Scottish National Party (SNP) supports a second independence referendum after the failed 2014 effort. After the SNP\u2019s success in the December 2019 general election, its leader Nicola Sturgeon claimed that the electoral success indicated that the party had a \u201c\u2026 renewed, refreshed and strengthened mandate\u201d to pursue a second referendum (), as the SNP claims that many Scots prefer being in the EU to being in the UK outside of the EU. To date, conservative governments under both Theresa May and Boris Johnson have denied the possibility of a second Scottish independence referendum.\nMost evidence on the evolution of the Scottish independence movement, prior to and just after the failed 2014 referendum, shows that both Scottish identity and beliefs about economic prospects of an independent Scotland are correlated with support for independence (e.g. , , , ; , , ). discuss the increasing salience of independence as an issue promoted by the SNP and how independence became a key political cleavage in the last 10\u201315 years, and show that the 2014 independence referendum itself accelerated this re-alignment where support for the SNP became increasingly due to pro-independence views. Support for independence appears to have increased since the failed 2014 referendum (, ), but there are few studies exploring the role that Brexit plays in such preferences.",
              "On the particular connection between the Scottish independence and Brexit, the debate prior to the failed referendum of 2014 and since has been premised partially on the assumption that a Scottish exit would allow it to re-enter EU. There is suggestive but not recent evidence that Scottish independence support is conditioned by expectations of international recognition. [Muro, Vidal, and Vlaskamp (2020)](javascript:;) find using 2014 survey experimental evidence that the prospect of international recognition increases support for independence; find weaker evidence that the prospect of EU recognition increases independence support on average, but that key sub-groups of Scots are more responsive to the possibility of such recognition. As with the above evidence on the role of economic expectations in the wake of possible independence, though, the causal role of expectations of EU recognition remains unclear (as such beliefs may not be separate from territorial preferences). Related, some have argued that a subset of SNP voters supported Leave strategically in order to produce the conditions for a second independence referendum ([Greene, Spoon, and Williams 2018](javascript:;)). This latter evidence however finds it difficult to disentangle the relationship between current territorial preferences and SNP support, and finds that a very large majority of independence supporters from 2014 also supported Remain; further, prior to Brexit, SNP leadership had strongly supported Remain. This set of findings provides suggestive support of the basic logic of territorial preferences being affected by negative shocks to the existing \u201cunion,\u201d but these previous data either come from prior to the Scottish referendum and Brexit (and the corresponding political fallout), or do not focus on Brexit scenarios. We draw on this evidence to argue that the role of Brexit scenarios should affect territorial views in Scotland."

The fact that Scotland had to leave the EU with the rest of the UK, despite 62% of Scots voting Remain in the Brexit referendum, created a grievance and a sense that Scotland\u2019s voice was being ignored.\nThe Brexit process has contributed to these feelings too. The Scottish government, along with the other devolved administrations, struggled to have any influence over Brexit negotiations. In preparing for Brexit, the UK government passed a series of laws that threaten to undermine the Scottish Parliament\u2019s law-making power. The [United Kingdom Internal Market Act](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4018581) is the most notable of these.\nAdding insult to injury, this Act was passed despite the Scottish Parliament (along with the Welsh Senedd) withholding its consent, against an established constitutional convention \u2013 known as the \u2013 which specifies that the UK Parliament will not normally pass laws in devolved areas without the consent of the devolved legislatures.\nThe Scottish government, led by the Scottish National Party, is committed to holding an independence referendum before the end of 2023. Rejoining the European Union will be central to its independence ambitions. But Brexit brings new challenges to the prospect of \u2018independence in Europe\u2019, and chief amongst these is the status of the border Scotland shares with England.\nFollowing Scottish independence, this would become an international border between Scotland and the UK; and if Scotland rejoined the EU, it would also become a new border between the EU and the UK.

Goods exports to the EU remain below their pre-pandemic/Brexit level, however: in 2024, goods exports to the EU were 18% below their 2019 level in real terms. It is important to point out, however, that goods exports to the EU were growing slowly before Brexit and the pandemic.

Using product-level trade flows between the EU and all other countries in the world as a comparison group, we find a sharp decline in trade from the UK to the EU and significant but smaller reductions in trade from the EU to the UK. However, when we estimate the size of the impact on trade using UK data and UK global trade as a benchmark, we find strikingly different results. We identify two key sources of this discrepancy. First, the UK\u2019s global exports grew relatively slowly. We argue these are not suitable as a no-Brexit counterfactual. Second, Brexit also led to breaks in the measurement of trade flows, particularly for the EU imports data. To resolve these issues, we combine UK-reported data for its trade with EU and EU data for its trade with the rest of the world to use as the appropriate benchmark for comparison. This generates an estimate that Brexit reduced trade by close to 20% in both directions.\nFollowing the decision to leave the European Union (EU) taken by a referendum in the United Kingdom (UK) in June 2016, a process of extensive negotiations on the withdrawal arrangements and future trading relationship began. These continued up until days before the agreed (and several times rescheduled) exit of the UK from the EU\u2019s Single Market and Customs Union on 31st December 2020. In the intervening years, many potential scenarios on the degree of continued trade links were considered and a wide literature on the potential impacts of Brexit emerged. These covered the impacts on the UK, the EU as a whole, individual member states and specific sectors. The immediate impact of the uncertainty induced by the referendum on economic outcomes led to negative impacts on investment and exports during the period before the UK official exit from the EU.",
              "The second reason for divergence in the estimated effects of Brexit is the difference in data sources. The exit of the UK from the EU Single Market resulted in data collection changes, which caused a noticeable discrepancy in values that EU and UK statistical agencies report for the same trade flow. We find that collection methods for bilateral EU\u2013UK trade changed less in the UK-reported data than in the EU-reported data. Therefore, we suggest the most accurate estimation of the impact of Brexit can be found by combining EU data for its trade with the rest of the world (to obtain the comparison group) with UK data as the source for bilateral UK\u2013EU trade. Using this \u2018hybrid\u2019 dataset, we find that Brexit has substantially reduced trade in both directions relative to the no-Brexit benchmark. In our baseline model, UK to EU trade declined by 16% and trade from EU to UK by 24%. We further examine the variation across member states, product types, time horizons and role of extensive and intensive margin.\nThe paper is organised as follows: Section 2 gives a descriptive overview of the evolution of UK trade with the EU and rest of the world before and Brexit. Section 3 goes into detail on data and measurement issues. Section 4 describes the methodology and presents the initial estimations from the separate EU-reported and UK-reported data. It then discusses the key reasons why they give different results. In Section 5 we show our baseline estimates of the impacts of Brexit on trade between the UK and the EU using the hybrid dataset. We examine the effects on aggregate EU trade and on member states and discuss some robustness checks. Section 6 examines how the results vary across sectors, time and also by intensive and extensive margins of trade.

              "Brexit introduced a major policy shift with respect to UK-EU trade relations and, by extension, non-EU relations. Given the importance of the EU market for UK goods and services, this shift was expected to impact UK economic performance in several areas. Portes () summarizes the evidence of this effect on three dimensions (trade, immigration, and investment). He concludes that UK trade has negatively suffered, consistent with predictions; that the impact on immigration has been much less negative than expected due to a sharp rise in immigration from outside the EU which has compensated, to some degree, the reduced immigration from the EU; and that the impact on investment has been somewhat more negative than expected. In addition to its impact on UK-EU trade, Brexit also affected trade between the UK and non-EU countries as agreements between the EU and third parties ceased to apply to the UK on exit. The effect of Brexit, though, is unlikely to be uniform both across sectors and across the many EU and non-EU countries that the UK trades with. For example, Portes and Springford () suggest that while there is some shortfall in migration for work, the impacts differ considerably between sectors. Bailey et al. () assert that the introduction of non-tariff barriers arising from Brexit has been particularly more challenging for smaller firms in the manufacturing supply chain.",
              "Brexit was a major change in the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU. Dhingra et al. () consider Brexit as the largest change in the UK\u2019s relationships globally in over half a century. It was inevitable that the exit process would be disruptive for several reasons. Firstly, disentangling decades of economic as well as institutional integration was bound to be challenging. In addition, it was not clear (until several years after the vote) what type of trade deal the UK and EU would be able to strike and implement post-Brexit. While trade rules would not change for several years after the vote, it was clear that Brexit would eventually introduce a new trade environment in the UK-EU relationship in the form of tariff and non-tariff barriers (or in the best-case scenario, non-tariff barriers only). Furthermore, the exit process was fraught with delays, ultimately culminating in the establishment of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) signed in December 2020. The TCA came into force in January 2021, reflecting the post-Brexit environment. Secondly, the UK was an economically important member of the EU. In 2016, the UK\u2019s contribution to the EU\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) stood at 16%, ranking second after Germany which contributed 21.1% to the EU\u2019s GDP, and just ahead of France which contributed 15% (Eurostat ). In 2015, a year before Brexit, 44% of UK exports of goods and services went to the EU, while 53% of UK imports came from the EU (ONS ). Since then, these ratios have gradually reduced. In 2022, about 42% of UK exports of goods and services went to the EU, and 48% of UK imports came from the EU (Ward and Webb ).",
              "Brexit is expected to have different impacts on UK trade with different countries. This heterogeneity across countries warrants analysis. With the UK out of the EU, a significant number of new trade negotiations will be at the bilateral level. Therefore, it is useful to understand the impact Brexit has had on UK trade with some of its key trading partners. This is a line of inquiry that is still faced with a paucity of literature. To help fill this gap, this study aims to assess the effect of Brexit on bilateral trade between the UK and EU member countries, as well as between the UK and key non-EU trading partners. Hence, unlike Kren and Lawless (), we enhance the bilateral effect analysis to also cover non-EU countries as well as EU countries with an extended dataset up to 2022Q3. The main question addressed in this study is how the change in the trade environment due to Brexit impacted UK trade with EU member countries and with major non-EU trading partners. While the Brexit vote happened in 2016, there was no change in trade rules until 2021. Therefore, technically, the underlying trade frictions had not changed in practice for most of the duration of this study. In any case, the focus of the current study is not to extract measures of trade frictions or border effects, but to show the differences in trade between pre-vote and post-vote regimes. By treating Brexit as a policy change, this study follows a long list of research that used this approach (use a variety of policy change dummies) to capture the effect of trade policy changes \u2013 for example, integration changes, such as monetary unions, or regional trade agreements (e.g., Dursun ; Micco, Stein, and Ordo\u00f1ez ; Brouwer, Paap, and Viaene ; among others).

              "In this paper, we assess the impact of the 2016 Brexit referendum itself and the introduction of the TCA on the geography of UK trade. Specifically, we examine the impact on trade between the United Kingdom and the 27 EU Member States with monthly data up to December 2021. We do so comparing UK\u2013EU trade to other trade flows as detailed in the methodological section. Estimation of the impacts of the TCA effect is made challenging by two concurring issues: the Covid-19 pandemic which disrupted economies and the sharp rise in shipping cost \u2013 which were also in large part a consequence of Covid-19. Similarly, the analysis of the effect of the referendum might be affected by other confounders. In order to isolate the impact of the referendum and of the TCA from other forces we apply a series of econometric techniques, which are difference-in-differences (DD), triple difference (DDD) and synthetic control (SC). In our principal regressions, we use total trade flows. It is possible that Covid may have had different impacts on different countries\u2019 trade; there may have been a differential impact on trade in Covid-related products which thus affects our aggregate regressions and/or Covid may have impacted differentially across sectors also affecting our aggregate regression. As discussed in Section 2 on the empirical strategy, we control and test for each of these possibilities.\nIt is important to note that in this paper we do not examine the impact on total UK trade to all destinations. Our focus is on UK trade with the EU. This is because, , if Brexit were to impact on trade, in the first instance we would expect this to impact on relative trade with the EU. Nevertheless, the aggregate trade effects are clearly of interest.",
              "As an EU Member State, the United Kingdom was part of the EU\u2019s Customs Union and part of the EU Single Market. The Single Market applies to countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Leaving the EU entailed a departure from each of these for the United Kingdom, but differentially for Great Britain and for Northern Ireland. Hence, Great Britain left both the Customs Union and the Single Market. In contrast, Northern Ireland remains in the EU\u2019s Single Market for goods, but not for services, and while not part of the Customs Union, remains part of the EU\u2019s common customs territory. The departure from the Customs Union and the Single Market has impacted the degree of market access between the United Kingdom and the EU (and the United Kingdom and third countries) in different ways. The changes in market access and the increase in firms\u2019 costs thus involve a combination of tariff barriers, administrative barriers and regulatory barriers.\nDeparture from the Customs Union means that the United Kingdom is free to set its own most favoured nation (MFN) tariffs on imported goods and is able to sign free trade agreements with third countries. The UK\u2019s MFN tariff was established in May 2020 and is commonly referred to as the UK Global Tariff (UKGT). To date, the United Kingdom has also managed to sign new free trade agreements with the EU (2021), Japan (2020), Australia (2022) and New Zealand (2022). The United Kingdom has also signed a series of \u2018continuity agreements\u2019 with those countries which have a free trade agreement with the EU, and consequently as did the United Kingdom when it was a member of the EU. The aim of the continuity agreements is to replicate as closely as possible the previous arrangements.",
              "The departure of the United Kingdom from the EU, as a process of trade policy \u2018disintegration\u2019 is a somewhat unprecedented policy change, which thus limits the existing relevant empirical literature. Regarding the possible impact on the United Kingdom, there is small literature on the impact of the Brexit referendum on the UK\u2013EU trade, mostly focusing on the effect of uncertainty. show that firms\u2019 entry into exporting to the EU was reduced in the first 6 months after the referendum as a consequence of an MFN tariff threat. use odds from the betting market to track the evolution of the Brexit referendum uncertainty over time, and show that the MFN threat started to affect the UK\u2013EU trade even before the referendum of June 2016. Looking at aggregate bilateral trade between the United Kingdom and 14 EU Member States, apply the SC method and find that the UK\u2013EU trade started to decline after the 2015 general election won by the Conservative party. look at the response of Portuguese exporters to the United Kingdom following the 2016 referendum. Comparing firm-level exports with the United Kingdom and other destinations, the authors find a decrease in export prices and volumes to the United Kingdom after the referendum, with heterogeneous effects along exporters and products. Work by using a large data set from a major UK retailer finds that following Brexit there was a switch of demand by UK consumers, with a 6% increase towards UK-produced goods, and a reduction of 13% away from EU goods."

              "Although the benefits of foreign direct investment (FDI) are well established in the economic literature, there remains a dearth of analysis of its impact within the European integration experience. Inward FDI is a major contributor to the diffusion of managerial best practices (Bloom et al 2012). It increases competition and shores up technological innovation (Alfaro et al 2004, Dhingra et al 2016). Also it should be more resilient than other international capital flows. Yet the literature estimating the FDI premium from EU membership remains scarce. European integration may have played a significant role and we need to get a good grasp of its effects.\nAnother reason to examine this issue is the comparison between the trade and the FDI impact of deep economic integration, of which the European integration experience is a textbook example. Focusing exclusively on trade, Glick and Rose (2016) find that earlier estimates of the effect of currency unions vanish when estimated using modern econometric techniques. Most of these techniques became standard after they published their original paper (Glick and Rose 2002). We ask whether the use of modern econometric techniques eliminates the effects of EU membership on FDI. We find that it does not, .\nFigure 1 shows FDI net inflows for the three largest economies in the EU. The UK is by far the largest recipient. Net FDI inflows were small until the mid-1990s but exhibit two periods of rapid expansion \u2013 one in the second half of the 1990s and the other between the dot-com bubble and the financial crisis. It is also worth noting that these flows are much more volatile than expected, which may reflect the increasing share of more \u2018footloose\u2019 service activities, especially finance.",
              "This column reports new estimates of the FDI premium from EU membership. We find that, between 1985 and 2013, EU membership increased FDI inflows by 28% (Bruno et al. 2016). This is a large, significant, and memorable effect \u2013 a percentage point for each of the 28 EU members. Our estimates for the FDI premium are robust and they range from 14% (Heckman) to 33% (OLS) to 38% (Poisson estimates). They survive the Glick-Rose critique and do so comfortably. However, and more importantly, they help advocate for FDI as a channel (in addition to trade) for delivering substantial payoffs from deep integration.\n. Foreign direct investment in France, Germany and the UK, 1970-2014 (net inflows, BoP, current US$)\n: World Bank World Development Indicators 2015.\nThe gravity model has been a staple of international economics. It explains bilateral cross-border flows (trade, migration, investment, etc) based on the relative size and distance between countries or regions (Baldwin and Taglioni 2011, Head and Mayer 2014). A country\u2019s economic size is expected to have a positive effect on bilateral flows while distance is expected to have a negative effect (distance is often taken to reflect a whole range of trade costs including language, bureaucracy, culture, etc). The last two decades have witnessed enormous progress in this area. Among many influential pieces, Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) and Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) are the crucial ones for our purposes. This new structural gravity approach (Fally 2015) provides needed theoretical underpinnings as well as strong support for the econometric estimation of gravity models. \nIn Bruno et al. (2016), we estimate the impact of EU membership on FDI. We used the latest available data on bilateral FDI flows, GDP and GDP per capita (sender and target), bilateral distance and the shares of manufacturing output, exports and imports in total GDP.",
              "How does our 28% estimate compare with and relate to other estimates in the literature? Straathof et al. (2008) use a gravity model to examine bilateral FDI stocks. One of their specifications uses dyadic fixed effects, a somewhat different set of controls and earlier data (1981-2005). They find that EU membership yields a 28% increase in its inward FDI stocks from other EU countries and a 14% increase from non-EU countries (their Table 5.1, column 2). Bevan and Estrin (2004) focus on the new EU member states and show that even the announcement of start of EU membership negotiations has a positive and significant effect on FDI inflows. We can also look at the bilateral trade flows literature for a comparison, but we need to bear in mind that we focus on bilateral FDI in our model. Baier et al. (2008) find that trade is increased by about 130% after 10 to 15 years of EU membership, while the similar impact of EFTA membership is about 35%. We find instead that EU membership increases FDI inflows by about 28% in a country that is a member of the EU, which may be because trade is easier to adjust than FDI flows. This may help further our understanding of how benefits from deep integration actually take root (Campos et al. 2015).\nHow much additional FDI does a country receive as a consequence of being a member of the EU? This is obviously an important question for which, surprisingly, one still finds very few answers. We find EU membership robustly increases net FDI inflows. Our three main estimates range between 14% and 38% depending on the choice of econometric technique. The average of these is 28%. This is a large, robust, significant, substantial, and memorable benefit \u2013 a percentage point for each of the 28 members of the EU. Moreover, this result has enormous implications for the European integration project and for countries, like the UK, that are currently considering substantial changes to the terms of their relationship with the EU."

According to its 3 alternative scenarios, the UK would face a fall in FDI flows by 10% under the European Economic Area membership, between \u221215% and \u221220% under an FTA with the EU or a reduction between 18% and 26% in the \u2018no deal\u2019 case. These results have been used to model the overall macro-economic impact of leaving the EU. calculate that the FDI stock would decrease by 34%. Conversely, predict a 22% decrease in FDI inflows in the UK after leaving the EU.\nThe empirical studies analysing and FDI find a positive relationship. This result is typical in economic integration processes, in general, but seems to be even more pronounced in the case of EU integration, and it is also confirmed by studies focusing on Brexit. Most studies cited above focus on estimating the size of the reduction in FDI stock or flows but did not evaluate its resulting impact, which is the focus of our paper.\nThe few papers which estimate the impact of a reduction on FDI in the UK after Brexit include the analysis of Dhingra et al., 2017, , , , , and .\nDhingra et al., 2017 and evaluate the impact of FDI flow reductions in the UK.

              "Several studies have assessed the impact of regional integration on the flows or stocks of FDI. Overall, they find that regional integration affects FDI entry positively. find evidence that a regional integration agreement (such as the EU membership) would increase the stock of FDI by around 27%.  estimates that a reduction of 20% in regulatory differences increases FDI inflows by 15% and suggests that belonging to the EU single market can have an additional positive impact on FDI flows beyond the effects of traditional agreements (FTAs). This postulation makes sense, given that the EU is the world's most integrated economic area (i.e. with the lowest regulatory barriers across different countries).\nFurther studies focus on the impact of the on FDI flows. For example,  examine the impact of EU membership on the Central and Eastern European economies. They find that key announcements around EU accession increased FDI inflow to the applicant countries. found that FDI to Spain expanded due to its EU accession and was crucial in promoting productivity growth. and found that the inward FDI in Spain and Portugal increased significantly after accessing the EU in 1986. Similar results were found for the UK, Ireland, Spain and Sweden (). also confirm the increase in FDI inflows for the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden. FDI inflows seem to rise when a country becomes part of the EU.  estimate the impact of a potential enlargement of the European (EMU) to the 10 countries that obtained EU membership in 2004. They estimate that the FDI inflow would rise by around 21%."

              "When it comes to letterbox firms, systemic risk would decline if UK firms moved more substance to the continent, and an EU-UK agreement could pave the way for improvements. It is not in UK supervisors\u2019 interest to allow cross-border fragility to pile up. A stronger and safer market will encourage growth, offsetting any initial shifts in business.\nSupervisors also need new ways to manage Brexit-related fragmentation of investment-firm oversight. Luxembourg harbours around \u20ac5.5 trillion in assets under management \u2013 more than the UK and almost double the size of what is held Germany or France. Yet many asset management firms in Luxembourg delegate portfolio management. There is a concern that these firms are mainly \u2018letterbox entities\u2019, with minimal presence in Luxembourg and real decision-making, risk management and other functions carried out in London. This could undermine proper oversight, as firms might have incentive to seek out low-regulation entry points into the EU while conducting real operations elsewhere. It does not help the UK to have its firms seeking out laxer rules for their cross-border business. A high-level agreement on common standards and manageable compliance burdens could help both sides.\nAs tensions recede, it is worth exploring how London could better serve as a hub for foreign direct investment into the EU. The UK is second overall, after the United States, representing 25 percent of all acquisitions and 21 percent of greenfield projects in the single market (European Commission, 2024). After Brexit, total FDI levels from the UK into the EU dropped by about one quarter, although the extent to which other jurisdictions may have stepped in is unclear, as some inflows originated from London-based non-UK firms. In any case, the UK can act as a single point of entry for many global firms into the EU, and the EU should welcome such investment."

              "The initial literature that examined the potential effect on FDI flows on a country's accession to a customs union essentially extended the well-understood concepts of \u2018trade creation\u2019 and \u2018trade diversion\u2019 to the issue of FDI. This then makes a series of predictions concerning both FDI flows into a country from outside the customs union, and also regarding intraunion FDI. Much of the analysis that seeks to link FDI decisions of firms to country level decisions regarding economic integration is based on the analysis of Rowthorn ().\nThese can be summarized as follows: firstly, that a country's membership of a customs union makes it more attractive for inward investment from outside the region (Collie, ), with a general increase in \u2018interbloc\u2019 FDI (Donnenfeld, ). This is in turn related to the \u2018optimal tariff\u2019 literature; see for example Blonigen and Cole (), who applied the model of Blanchard () to the case of Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization. Theoretically, one could adopt a similar analysis to the case of Brexit, concluding that the UK may seek to attract \u2018tariff jumping\u2019 FDI at the expense of the EU. This is, however, not a position that those advocating Brexit have yet adopted, for fear that retaliation from the EU would cause a reduction in FDI to the UK from outside the EU. Bajo-Rubio and L\u00f3pez-Pueyo () for example argued that Spain became more attractive for non-EU inward investment as the EU moved towards the single market in 1992.",
              "Since the outcome on the UK's exit (\u2018Brexit\u2019) from the European Union (EU) referendum there has been much comment on the likely nature of the UK's trading relationship with the EU and the rest of the world. However, despite its importance to the UK economy, the effect on inward foreign direct investment (FDI) received little comment during the referendum debate, and only more recently have the positions of, for example, the Japanese car makers in the UK been the focus of attention. This is despite the fact that the UK has been for 40 years not merely open to inward investment but has actively sought foreign investment across all sectors. Many UK and non-UK firms have taken the opportunity to develop supply chains that cross into and out of the UK several times. The position of these firms, and the capacity for the UK to continue to attract inward FDI, is potentially one of the most important economic aspects of the UK's leaving the EU.\nIt is well known that the UK has a long running trade deficit, but what has received much less attention is the extent to which the adverse long-term effects of this have been offset by the quantity of inward FDI that the UK attracts. Hitherto, any analysis of the likely effect of Brexit in terms of firm location decisions has focused on seeking to explore the extent to which such decisions have historically been influenced by the UK's membership of the EU. A more targeted approach would be to explore the short and long-term dynamics of FDI into the UK, and to use them to infer the implications of Brexit. This is the approach that we propose. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to explore the likely effect on inward investment of Brexit, with a particular focus on distinguishing between the long-term drivers of inward investment into the UK, and the effect of short-term volatility.",
              "Even more interestingly, Brexit raises a more general issue that the literature on FDI has yet to address. In particular, there has been a plethora of papers focusing on the effect of joining a free-trade area or a customs union and especially the EU; still, we know surprisingly little about a reverse move, leaving a free-trade area or a customs union, since the noteworthy instances are too few to draw even speculative conclusions. (The Seychelles and Madagascar left the Southern African Development Community for a period, and membership of the Central European Free Trade Agreement when a country joins the EU. To the best of our knowledge these are the only examples of countries leaving a customs union.) The naive approach, which was sometimes offered by politicians in the run up to the referendum and indeed by some for the 12 months up to the 2017 UK general election but dismissed almost unanimously by policy makers, academics and the popular press, would be simply to assume that the effect on FDI would simply be zero, with new opportunities offsetting any detrimental effects. And yet, what may happen to (inward) FDI is more than an important concern; it is a centrepiece economic criterion to make a decision to remain or not in a free-trade area or a customs union. Given that the country that considers such a move is the UK, and that the union that it involves is the EU, having a framework to study how FDI could possibly react to such an event is as timely an issue as it can ever be."

              "This historical context sets the stage for the debate on the resolution: \u201cThe United Kingdom should rejoin the European Union.\u201d Below, we present the major arguments on both sides of this question, as of 2025, considering economic, political, social, legal, and geostrategic dimensions. The perspectives of stakeholders within the UK, in the EU, and internationally will be noted, drawing on the developments of both the pre-Brexit and post-Brexit periods.\n## Arguments in Favor of the UK Rejoining the EU\nAdvocates for the UK (\u201cRejoiners\u201d) argue that Brexit has been detrimental in numerous ways, and that renewed EU membership would yield significant benefits. Their case spans economic gains, political influence, social opportunities, diplomatic and security advantages, legal alignment , and broader strategic considerations. Proponents draw on evidence from the Brexit experience \u2013 pointing to losses incurred since 2020 \u2013 as well as the advantages the UK used to enjoy as an EU member. Below are the major pro-rejoin arguments in 2025:\n### Economic Benefits and Market Access",
              "Finally, at the level of global trade talks and standards, the EU\u2019s clout far exceeds the UK\u2019s alone. A rejoined UK would be part of one of the two biggest rule-making entities in the global economy (the EU and US). This means more with powers like China or the United States. For instance, if the EU sets data privacy standards (as it did with GDPR) or negotiates trade terms, the UK as a member would benefit from those, whereas outside it often ends up aligning with EU rules anyway (to access the market) but without any control. In summary, the political argument is that EU membership empowers British influence , both within Europe and globally, far more than the \u201csplendid isolation\u201d Brexit was supposed to grant. Britain may have \u201ctaken back control\u201d on paper, but in reality being outside has often meant over the European decisions that matter. Rejoining would remedy that.\n### Social, Cultural, and Mobility Advantages",
              "Socially, EU membership also implies being part of a broader European community. Many in the UK feel European and welcomed the cultural exchange that came with membership \u2013 from ease of tourism to town twinning to collaborative projects in arts and science. Rejoining would reaffirm common values and collaboration with neighbors. This has intangible benefits: for instance, it could reduce the sense of insularity and mend some of the societal polarization that Brexit induced. Free movement is not just about work \u2013 it facilitates cross-cultural understanding, familial ties (there are countless binational families who have struggled with the new residency rules), and the general openness of society. Proponents often mention that Britons were living in other EU countries pre-Brexit (in Spain, France, etc.), and a similar number of EU citizens were long-term residents of the UK. Brexit complicated their lives with new bureaucratic hurdles. Rejoining would resolve the status of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU at a stroke , by reinstating their automatic rights."

              "This increased support for a different kind of relationship with the EU seems to be mostly driven by the changing attitudes among some 2016 Leavers, who appear to have become more unsure about the effects of Brexit. Within the next ten to 15 years, nearly one in five Leave voters (18 per cent) would either like the UK to re-join the EU or the single market and a further 45 per cent would like to see a closer relationship or see the UK in a new kind of association with the EU.\nIn considering what these findings mean for future government policy and the UK\u2019s post-Brexit relationship with the EU, we suggest that:\n  * There is a need for Britain\u2019s political leaders to openly acknowledge the immediate consequences of Brexit and set out a plan to fix them. A substantial majority of the public, including Leave voters, think that Brexit has had a negative impact on their lives \u2013 and there is no political prize for shying away from the conversation about the costs of Brexit to date.\n  * Little public support exists for deregulation away from high standards in the pursuit of future trade deals. The British public overwhelmingly supports high standards on the environment, labour and social rights and food safety, even at the cost of not striking major trade agreements, suggesting that any deregulation agenda that lowers current protections will have extraordinarily low levels of public support.\n  * The British public is more pragmatic on Europe than is often portrayed by politicians and the media. While the public does simply want to move on from debating Brexit, the data show that voters tend to evaluate the trade-offs inherent in different choices in a pragmatic way. The public deserves honesty and transparency from political leaders about what consequences future choices will entail.",

Over half of Labour and Liberal Democrat voters would be at least in favour of re-joining the EU single market, but there is a significant group within both voter groups who do not wish to re-join the EU or the single market but wish to forge a closer kind of relationship outside existing institutions.\n#### Support for a closer medium-term relationship is shared across all major political parties\n_Survey question: Of the following options, which one would you choose for the UK\u2019s place within Europe in the next 10_ \u2013\n_Note: Due to rounding of the polling data, there may be marginal variations between data visualisations and figures quoted in the text._\n#### 10.

              "* Brexit is regarded as largely negative by a substantial majority of the public \u2013 including a far-from-negligible proportion of Leavers and 2019 Conservative voters.\n  * A large proportion of the British public is supportive of forging a closer relationship with the EU post-Brexit, especially on security matters and trade, but there is still reluctance from most of the public to go as far as re-joining the EU single market.\n  * The British public is pragmatic in the choices that they would make over crucial aspects of the future relationship, including maintaining high regulatory standards that the UK once inherited from the EU, accepting a limited role for the European Court of Justice in the future if it means keeping the country more secure, or choosing to voluntarily align to EU rules in those areas where it clearly leads to economic benefits for consumers."

Often acrimonious debates in the UK Houses of Parliament led, eventually, to the United Kingdom's formal departure from the EU on January 31, 2020, but, at the time of writing, disagreements continue about the economic and social consequences of the departure, with polling indicating that UK public opinion continues to be highly polarized on the issue (Curtice, )."

              "Barely one-fifth of respondents across the four biggest EU members, from 19% in Italy and to 21% in Spain and 22% in Germany, felt the UK should be allowed to return to the bloc on those terms, with 58-62% saying it must be part of all main EU policy areas.\nThe pollster stress-tested western European attitudes by asking whether, if the UK was only willing to rejoin the EU on condition it could keep its old opt-outs, it should be allowed to. Some (33-36%) felt this would be acceptable, but more (41-52%) were opposed.\nIn the UK, while 54% of Britons supported rejoining the EU when asked the question in isolation, the figure fell to just 36% if rejoining meant giving up previous opt-outs. On those terms, 45% of Britons opposed renewed membership.\nThe survey found that remain voters and those who backed more pro-EU parties would still broadly back rejoining if this meant adopting the euro and being part of the Schengen area, albeit at much lower rates.\nAlmost 60% of remain voters said they would support rejoining the EU without the previous opt-outs, down about 25 percentage points from the non-specific question, as would 58% of Labour voters (-23 points) and 49% of Liberal Democrats (-31 points).\nThe percentage of Eurosceptic voters willing to rejoin without the previous special treatment more or less halved, falling from 21% to 10% among leave voters; 25% to 12% among Conservative voters, and 15% to 9% among Reform UK supporters.\nThe fifth continental European country polled, Denmark, proved an outlier. Respondents there were very keen (72%) for the UK to rejoin, and more enthusiastic than larger member states about it keeping its previous opt-outs (43%).\nDenmark, however, is one of only three EU member states to hold opt-outs in major EU policy areas. The survey also found that large majorities in all five continental countries (63-75%) would support an independent Scotland joining the EU."

              "This does not mean that a Europeanised UK is destined to rejoin the EU. It would more than likely take another critical juncture to break the path dependence of the TCA\u2019s hard Brexit. Further, while the UK has engaged with European multilateralism, a distance has remained with the EU. The war in Ukraine has reminded British policy makers that the UK has withdrawn from the EU but not from Europe. But that has meant a focus on relations with European states through NATO (as discussed by Cladi) and, at some remove, with the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (Grogan ). It has also entailed a lot of muddling through in building links, especially bilateral ones, so as to avoid any formal UK-EU institutional setup on foreign policy coordination. The 2021 reflected this tone, making only a passing mention of the EU. This is not a sign of the EU\u2019s lack of importance to the UK\u2019s international relations; it is, rather, a sign of how such documents are drafted with political sensitivities in mind with geopolitics placed second. The 2015 UK also said very little about the EU, despite it being published shortly after the election of a government with a commitment to put to the British people one of the biggest foreign policy choices since 1945. That the EU remains the UK\u2019s most important multilateral relationship means the potential exists for closer UK-EU relations, but many decision makers remain uneasy at accepting this."

          "answer": "**Report: Should the United Kingdom Rejoin the European Union?**\n\n---\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nSince the 2016 referendum, the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) exit from the European Union (EU) has reshaped its political framework, economic relationships, and social identity. Nearly a decade later, debate continues over whether rejoining the EU would better serve the UK\u2019s national interests. This report assesses the merits of potential reaccession by integrating analysis of **political**, **economic**, and **social-strategic** implications. Drawing from the findings of three detailed sub-studies, the report examines how EU membership would affect sovereignty, governance, economic performance, national cohesion, and global influence.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Political Implications**\n\nRejoining the EU would recalibrate the UK\u2019s political structure and multilevel governance relationships. Politically, membership would reintroduce the primacy of EU law, curtailing absolute Westminster sovereignty but granting Britain representation within EU decision-making bodies such as the Parliament, Commission, and Council [Child 1]. This shift represents a trade-off between autonomy and participation: while the UK would again need to align with EU law\u2014including free movement and Single Market regulations\u2014it would regain internal influence over European policies rather than functioning as an external rule-taker [Child 1].\n\nDomestically, renewed membership could stabilize constitutional tensions among devolved governments by restoring frameworks for cooperative policymaking. In Scotland, this step may undercut pro-independence arguments tied to EU re-entry, while in Northern Ireland, alignment with EU regulatory norms could ease border management and reinforce the peace process [Child 1]. However, Euroskeptic sentiment and divisions over sovereignty would likely persist among segments of the electorate.\n\nIn global governance terms, rejoining would re-embed the UK within a multilateral bloc capable of shaping joint policies on trade, security, and climate issues. While sovereignty would be shared, Britain\u2019s ability to influence regional decisions would rise compared to its current position outside the Union [Child 1].\n\n---\n\n### **2. Economic Implications**\n\nEconomically, the implications of rejoining are largely positive. Integration into the **Single Market** and **Customs Union** would restore frictionless trade\u2014eliminating tariffs, quotas, and most regulatory barriers\u2014thus revitalizing supply chains and reducing compliance costs [Child 2]. This reintegration would improve competitiveness in major sectors like manufacturing, finance, and logistics, while restoring investor confidence and access to European markets.\n\nEvidence suggests foreign direct investment (FDI) could rise by **14\u201338%** relative to post-Brexit levels due to renewed stability and predictable regulation [Child 2]. The UK would again serve as a key gateway for global investors entering Europe. Restoring free movement would further alleviate labor shortages in critical industries, although it would also limit control over immigration policy.\n\nMacroeconomically, rejoining is projected to yield measurable gains in productivity and GDP growth through enhanced market access, capital flows, and workforce mobility. These benefits would offset the loss of unilateral trade policy autonomy and the fiscal costs of EU membership contributions [Child 2]. In sum, the economic evidence indicates strong long-term benefits from rejoining, with the balance of costs favoring renewed integration.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Social and Strategic Implications**\n\nSocially, rejoining the EU would reknit ties between the UK and broader European society. Cultural and educational exchanges would expand through restored participation in programs such as Erasmus-style initiatives, science collaborations, and cross-border mobility schemes [Child 3]. A renewal of shared European identity may reduce the social polarization triggered by Brexit, fostering a more pragmatic and outward-facing political climate [Child 3].\n\nStrategically, EU reentry would reinforce the UK\u2019s international standing within Western alliances. Membership would deepen coordination within EU diplomatic and security frameworks while complementing its NATO role. The UK would once again help shape European policies on defense, trade, and energy security from within rather than negotiating from the outside [Child 3]. This alignment would elevate its influence in global discourse and enhance its capacity to manage regional security and economic shocks collectively.\n\nTogether, these social and strategic outcomes suggest that rejoining could strengthen both internal cohesion and external projection of power, aligning civic unity with diplomatic leverage.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Integrated Evaluation**\n\nAcross political, economic, and social dimensions, EU re-accession presents a complex balance of costs and advantages. Politically, sovereignty would be pooled rather than restored to full independence; however, influence within a major bloc and stabilization of internal political strains could yield net governance gains [Child 1]. Economically, evidence points decisively toward benefits in trade, investment, and labor dynamics, providing substantial relief to industries and regions strained by post-Brexit barriers [Child 2]. Socially, renewed European engagement could soften polarization, restore identity coherence, and reposition the UK as a cooperative rather than insular power [Child 3].\n\nThe key trade-off lies between symbolic sovereignty and pragmatic advantages. While rejoining entails partial regulatory alignment and fiscal contributions, it would restore enabling conditions for prosperity, influence, and cohesion. The feasibility of re-accession would, however, depend on domestic political will and the EU\u2019s readiness to readmit the UK under potentially revised terms.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the integrated findings, the evidence collectively supports the argument that **the United Kingdom should seriously consider rejoining the European Union**, provided political conditions permit. The economic gains, diplomatic renewal, and social stabilization that accompany membership outweigh the sovereignty-related costs identified across the analyses [Child 1][Child 2][Child 3].  \n\nRejoining would not merely reverse Brexit\u2014it would represent a recalibration of Britain\u2019s identity and strategy toward collaborative governance. That decision, however, remains contingent on domestic consensus and careful negotiation to ensure alignment between national priorities and European frameworks.\n\n---\n\n**Citations:** [Child 1][Child 2][Child 3]"

              "The of 2016 suggests that such votes might not go as polling suggests. In such a scenario, Leave parties might have lost the preceding general election, but they would still have considerable resources and activists to push a message that would inevitably revolve around how politicians want to overturn the 2016 decision.\nThe ability of campaigners to get voters to actually vote would be more constrained in any new vote, as they will face the additional hurdle of explaining why the public need to return to an issue that was supposedly settled only a few years ago. The legitimacy of a rejoin majority but with fewer votes than Leave last time would open a new point of attack from those who wanted to fight it.\nAt which point we run into the elephant in the room: rejoining isn\u2019t just up to the UK.\nThe EU holds all the over whether to let a country become a member: rejoining states don\u2019t get any special rights in that regard. Not only do you have to comply with entry requirements on political and economic capacity to manage the effects of membership, but you also have to get the explicit approval of all existing member states and of the European Parliament.\nNone of that is a given.\nAs times passes, the UK is diverging from EU standards. Moreover, as a new applicant the UK would be obliged to commit to being part of those bits of the EU that it used to have opt-outs on, like the Euro, Schengen and various bits of justice and home affairs.\nMember states and the EU Parliament might also have doubts about whether they want the UK back. They might be concerned, for example, that the UK would stymie certain policy agendas, since the UK would once more be getting to vote on things it dislikes (such as, possibly, the package with its debt financing)."

              "Another major pro-EU argument centers on . Inside the EU, the UK had a seat at the table in shaping European-wide decisions that inevitably affect its interests; outside, the UK has found it often must accept or adjust to EU decisions without a voice. Advocates for rejoining argue that Britain\u2019s global influence was amplified by being an EU member. The EU, with its combined economic weight and regulatory power, can set standards (from environmental rules to tech regulation) that smaller individual countries often end up following. As an EU member, the UK was one of the \u201cBig Three\u201d alongside Germany and France, and British diplomats and Members of the European Parliament had significant sway over EU policies. If the UK rejoined, it could once again help steer EU policy on trade, digital regulation, climate change, and more, rather than watching from the outside. This influence is seen as especially important given that many EU rules will affect the UK regardless \u2013 for instance, EU product standards must be met by UK companies exporting to Europe. It would be better to \u201cbe in the room\u201d and shape those rules than to be a rule-taker, proponents say.\nDomestically, rejoining the EU could also ease certain political tensions. For example, it might strengthen the unity of the UK itself. Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in 2016; Brexit has since fueled calls for Scottish independence and complicated governance in Northern Ireland. If the UK as a whole re-enters the EU, the pressure for Scotland to leave the UK in order to rejoin Europe might diminish. Essentially, UK-wide EU membership could remove one of the grievances that separatists cite (Scotland \u201cbeing taken out of the EU against its will\u201d). Some unionists argue this would help \u201ctake the wind out of the sails\u201d of Scottish independence sentiment and thus preserve the UK\u2019s integrity.",
              "Proponents also argue that rejoining would affirm the UK\u2019s commitment to . The EU\u2019s laws on things like food safety (e.g., banning certain additives), environmental law (water quality, air pollution limits), and digital regulation (like the GDPR for data privacy) set a benchmark. Since Brexit, the UK government has considered or enacted changes that diverge \u2013 for example, contemplating lowering food import standards or scrapping some EU-derived worker protections. Those in favor of EU membership worry this could lead to a erosion of standards in the long run (a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d). By rejoining, the UK would recommit to those shared high standards and eliminate the risk of regulatory rollback in areas where the EU leads. Essentially, it future-proofs certain rights and norms by binding the UK into the collective legal commitments of the EU.\nFinally, there\u2019s a constitutional argument: Brexit and its aftermath have been very consuming for the UK\u2019s governance, sparking legal battles (like the 2019 prorogation of Parliament case) and questions about the (Scotland and Northern Ireland\u2019s place in the Union). Some legal scholars in the pro-EU camp argue that rejoining could provide a stable framework for the UK\u2019s internal constitutional arrangements, because the EU\u2019s multilevel governance gives a voice to regions (Scotland and Wales could engage in EU forums) and lessens some conflicts. While this is a more abstract point, the idea is that the EU framework supports the rule of law and pluralism , which aligns with the UK\u2019s own constitutional values.",
              "In summary, legal alignment with the EU is portrayed as beneficial for consistency, rights, and standards. Rejoining would erase the legal fragmentation that Brexit created, making life simpler for businesses and citizens and ensuring that the UK operates under the robust legal regime that governs its neighbors. It would trade a bit of abstract sovereignty for a lot of practical legal cohesion and clout (since the UK would again help shape EU laws via the Council and Parliament).\nOn the global stage, proponents argue that both the UK and Europe as a whole would be geopolitically stronger if the UK rejoins the EU. We live in a time of \u2013 the United States and China are superpowers, Russia is an aggressive regional power, and new blocs are forming. Europe must remain united to assert its interests and values in this environment. A UK inside the EU makes the and creates a bloc of democracies in Europe that is more comparable in weight to the U.S. or China. Geostrategically, a reunited Europe including Britain would command greater respect in trade negotiations, climate negotiations, and in setting international standards."

Those interactions inescapably erode the ability of the UK\u2019s government and citizens to make independent untrammeled decisions. Yes, the UK\u2019s membership in the European Union erodes formal sovereignty. Economic, social, and cultural interrelationships intentionally erode sovereignty. However, because of the cooperative relationships across the English Channel, the UK\u2019s membership in the European Union has on balance rather than eroded effective U.K. autonomy. British skeptics can legitimately argue that the EU Commission and its governments may have adopted excessive regulations. But skeptics cannot argue that those decisions were taken without U.K. participation. Whatever future decisions may be made about Brexit, moreover, many of the existing cooperative relationships with the EU are likely to be maintained\u2014precisely to forestall an unwanted deterioration in effective U.K. autonomy.\nAnti-EU sentiment can question not only whether economic relations with the EU have been conducted appropriately. EU skeptics may logically complain about unwanted immigration from Europe. They may logically assert that EU membership undermines U.K. culture and national identity. It would be unfortunate, however, if most Brits were to favor a Brexit because of superficial yearning for elusive sovereignty.",
              "Think of regulations and oversight about the production and marketing of medications. By agreement of all EU members including the UK, cooperative oversight throughout the EU is typically beneficial. The functions of the European Medicines Agency are to provide such oversight. If an exit-deal Brexit is to occur, cooperative adjustments need to be found to support some form of continuation of the EMA\u2019s oversight. Analogous comments apply to a wide range of issues that affect all members of the European Union. Another example highly important to the U.K. is the design of regulations and oversight for the provision of financial services throughout the EU.\nRegulation and oversight of immigration from Europe is more controversial. Some British residents complain, for example, that the free movement of labour within the EU has led to a surge of Europeans coming into the UK, taking jobs away from locals, flooding the schools with their children, committing crimes. Emotions can run high about threats to national culture and traditional ways of life. In turn the U.K. governments experience strong pressure to reduce the ease of movement of Europeans crossing the U.K. border.\nMost of the difficult issues will require UK-EU cooperation whether or not the U.K. finds itself outside the EU fence. The issue areas had to be addressed in the past while the U.K. was inside the European Union. They will need continued attention even if the U.K. chooses a no-Brexit remain."

Photo: iStock.\n  * The question of sovereignty lies at the heart of the UK\u2019s upcoming EU referendum. Many in Britain believe that the process of EU decision-making has undermined British parliamentary democracy, and that leaving the EU is the only way for the British people to regain control of their sovereignty.\n  * This ignores the fact that successive British governments have chosen to pool aspects of the country\u2019s sovereign power in the EU in order to achieve national objectives that they could not have achieved on their own, such as creating the single market, enlarging the EU, constraining Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, and helping to design an ambitious EU climate change strategy.\n  * Apart from EU immigration, the British government still determines the vast majority of policy over every issue of greatest concern to British voters \u2013 including health, education, pensions, welfare, monetary policy, defence and border security. The arguments for leaving also ignore the fact that the UK controls more than 98 per cent of its public expenditure.\n  * The British economy has prospered in the EU. The UK boasts higher economic growth and lower unemployment than most major developed economies. It attracts the most foreign direct investment in the EU, and is ranked among the most open places to do business in the developed world. British economic weaknesses, such as low growth in productivity, are self-inflicted.",
              "* However, a successful economy and free-movement rules have led to high levels of immigration from the EU. Overall, this has been positive for the UK economy, but it has exacerbated preexisting pressures on public services, may have restricted wage growth in some sectors, and is a source of widespread public concern.\n  * Is it time, therefore, to return economic and political sovereign power entirely to Westminster? The risks of doing so are extensive. For example, the UK would be excluded from the process of EU rule-writing, making it a less attractive location for foreign investment. The UK is unlikely to strike better trade deals alone than it has currently through the EU. And the UK would have no say in the design of more open EU markets for digital, financial and other services. Leaving would also have a destabilizing effect on the rest of the EU, which will remain Britain\u2019s largest market.\n  * In contrast, the main risks to the UK of remaining are political. High levels of immigration from the EU would persist. However, it is inconceivable that the EU will enlarge to include Turkey in the foreseeable future, and the UK and other EU states retain a veto over this decision.\n  * Nor need the UK fear the emergence of a more integrated eurozone, which will continue to feature profound differences in national outlook and is unlikely to enlarge quickly. EU decision-making overall is also becoming more intergovernmental rather than centralized.\n  * Continuing to pool its sovereign power selectively in the EU would enable the UK to help design integrated EU responses to many challenges that it cannot resolve on its own. These include the challenges of energy efficiency and sustainability; energy security; internet governance; and the fight against terrorism.",
              "* In a world that is more interdependent today than it was when the UK joined the European Economic Community in 1973, the notion of \u2018absolute\u2019 British sovereignty is illusory. It is also worthless if it limits the ability of future British governments to ensure the security and prosperity of their citizens. Judging from the UK\u2019s experience and its future prospects, the opportunities from remaining in the EU far outweigh the risks of doing so, and the risks of leaving far outweigh the opportunities."

While the majority of international leaders have the UK to remain in the EU, one vocal supporter stood out from the pack: Barack Obama."

              "Currently, the European Parliament is made up of 751 MEPs who are organised into eight political groups. These are not strictly parties, but rather coalitions between MEPs from different countries with similar ideological outlooks. A minimum of 25 members representing at least one quarter of member states are needed to form a group. Not all MEPs belong to a political group \u2013 these are known as non-attached members. Each MEP serves for a five-year term. The UK elects 73 of those.\nBoth the UK and the EU27 have recognised that delaying the UK\u2019s Brexit date will likely require the UK to hold European Parliament elections.\nThere are three main reasons for this:\n1) EU members states are legally required to hold European Parliament elections. The European Commission could choose to initiate treaty infringement proceedings against the UK for denying UK or EU citizens in the UK the right to vote, or indeed stand, in European Parliament elections. Any attempt to install MEPs without elections could also be subject to challenge in the EU courts.\n2) If the UK decided to remain a member state past July but had not taken part in the EU elections, then the new European Parliament \u2013 without British seats \u2013 would not be able to carry out its activities.\n3) Excluding the UK would require treaty reform, which the EU would find hard to agree at very short notice, not least given the need for ratification by member states.\nHowever, if the UK has ratified the Withdrawal Agreement \u2013 which requires parliamentary approval \u2013 by 22 May, the UK will not need to take part in the elections. If Parliament does not approve a deal by this time and the UK does not hold European Parliament elections, it will have to leave the EU without a deal on 1 June.",
              "In June 2018, the EU decided it would reduce the overall number of seats in the European Parliament after Brexit to 705 (down from 751) and reallocate 27 of the 73 UK seats to other EU countries. The plan was for this distribution to be effective from the next European Parliament. If the UK were to take part, the EU would need to halt this reconfiguration.\nVoting across other member states will take place between 23\u201326 May. Results cannot be announced before 11:00pm Brussels time on 26 May to ensure the results in one country do not prejudice votes in another. New MEPs will take up their seats on 2 July.\nThe EU needs to know by mid-April whether to halt the reconfiguration of seats. On the UK side, the Government has already laid the necessary legislation allowing the UK to take part in the 2019 European Parliament elections on 23 May.\nThe deadline for registered parties submitting the candidates they want to contest the election to the Electoral Commission is 25 April. Individual parties have their own deadlines for candidates applying to run.\nThe UK is divided into 12 regions: nine in England, and one each for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each region has a set number of MEPs, who are elected through proportional representation \u2013 although the method differs between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In England, Scotland and Wales, MEPs are elected using the [D\u2019Hondt system within each region](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27187434). Parties draw up regional lists of candidates which they share with the electorate. The party that wins the most votes can send the candidate at the top of its list to Brussels. The winning party\u2019s vote total is then halved, and the party with the highest tally in the second re-ordered list can send an MEP to Brussels. The process repeats itself until all candidates for the region are appointed.",
              "The 73 British MEPs would cease to be members once the UK has left the EU. It is unclear whether plans for a post-Brexit reconfiguration of the European Parliament would then come into effect before the 2024 European Parliament elections.\nPotentially. In 2014, the EU introduced the (lead candidate) process to select the new President of the EU Commission. This meant that rather than simply emerging from discussion in the Council, EU leaders proposed the lead candidate of the biggest parliamentary grouping as the new president of the Commission. Jean-Claude Juncker was nominated under this process as the lead candidate of the European People\u2019s Party.\nMost parliamentary groupings have already selected their candidates this time: these include German MEP Manfred Weber for the European People\u2019s Party and Frans Timmermans, the Dutch Vice President of the Commission, for the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. No UK MEP would boost the numbers of the European People's Party since the Conservatives left the grouping in 2009, but Labour MEPs would increase the numbers in the Socialists and Democrats. It is possible that this could make a difference to the numbers \u2013 but it is also possible that EU leaders could decide to nominate a candidate from another parliamentary grouping or someone other than a designated \nWhat tariffs has Donald Trump announced \u2013 and what do they mean for the UK? \nEconomic and fiscal forecasts are a critical part of the government budget process.

              "## How do the elections work?\nGreat Britain uses a list system and divides the country into 12 electoral regions, with voters casting a single vote for their preferred party. Northern Ireland uses the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system for its three MEPs, where voters can choose their second and third preferences.\nPolitical parties produce lists of candidates for each region and order the candidates according to who is their first nomination. The \u2018closed list system\u2019 used in the UK means that voters simply cast one vote for the party that they wish to support, and the parties decide in what order their candidates are listed.\nAs parties win seats, those at the top of the lists gain them first. The number of seats each party receives is calculated using the d\u2019Hondt method of proportional representation. The party with the most votes wins the first seat available.\nHowever, once a party has been given a seat, its votes are halved (i.e. divided by the number of seats it has, plus one) and whoever has the most votes after that gets the next seat. If the winning party gets substantially more votes than any other, it could also win the second seat. If that were the case, its total votes would then be divided by the number of seats it has plus one (three in total), and the process continues until all of the seats up for election are distributed.\nDo elections work the same way everywhere in the EU?\nNo. Although the electoral systems used must all be proportional, member states can use different proportional systems. The \u2018closed list system\u2019 used in the UK means that voters simply cast one vote for the party that they wish to support, and the parties decide in what order their candidates are listed. However, a majority of EU countries use a \u2018preferential list system\u2019, allowing voters to cast ballots for both parties and individual candidates. Ireland and Malta use the same \u2018single transferable vote system\u2019 which is used in Northern Ireland.",
              "In most member states (eg. Spain), MEPs are elected to a single, nation-wide constituency. In others, such as the UK, MEPs represent constituencies (one of 12 regions). Minimum age requirements, electoral thresholds, compulsory voting, requirements to stand for election, and the particular date and time of the elections differ across the EU.\nThe European Council has set out how the UK\u2019s seats will be redistributed to other member states should it leave the EU. Of the 73, only 27 will be reallocated, reducing the European Parliament to 705 MEPs in total.\nThe fact Brexit hasn\u2019t happened complicates the elections for those states earmarked to receive extra MEPs. Ireland, for instance, currently elects 11 MEPs, but when the UK leaves it will gain a further two seats. If the UK takes part this time but leaves during the parliament, Ireland and others will have to fill these seats. As a result, Ireland is electing \u2018reserve\u2019 candidates at this election who will take up the extra seats when and if the UK leaves.\nHow are parties organised in the European Parliament?\nUnlike the UK, MEPs sit in cross-national groups that their national parties are affiliated with, largely based around shared political ideologies. For instance, the Conservatives sit with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group and Labour sit with the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) group. These groups tend to vote in blocs in much the same way as political parties do in Westminster.\nAlthough most groups persist from one parliament to the next, new groupings tend to be formed in each five-year term. A group must have at least 25 MEPs from at least seven member states. There were eight political groups in the 2014-19 parliament running across the full spectrum from far-left to far-right. No single group is even close to a majority of seats in the Parliament, so coalition-building is part and parcel of how the Parliament works.\n## Subscribe to the UKICE newsletter"

Most importantly, the main pan-European parties are fielding lead candidates for European Commission President. Turning the election into a presidential horse race was intended to increase electoral participation and enhance the Parliament\u2019s democratic legitimacy, even though it remains to be seen whether voters will actually see things this way.\nCritics often blame European citizens\u2019 relative lack of interest in the European Parliament on its inherent inequality of representation. Voters in smaller member states are overrepresented. Germany\u2019s Federal Constitutional Court, when ruling on the Lisbon Treaty on 30 June 2009, said that the European Parliamentary election process \u2018does not take due account of equality\u2019. In the Court\u2019s view, this constitutes one of two key factors in the European Union\u2019s \u2018structural democratic deficit\u2019, the other being the European Parliament\u2019s \u2018position in the European competence structure\u2019, i.e. its lack of power compared to other EU institutions.\nHow unequal is the representation comparatively? \nIn the Treaty on European Union, government representation in the lower house is based on both a principle of disproportionate electoral weight given to smaller countries, and on binding thresholds of minimum and maximum representation. As a consequence, the European Parliament is at the low end in terms of electoral equality.\n  * One way to measure voter inequality is to look at the \u2018voting Gini coefficient\u2019.\n  * This uses the familiar measure of inequality of income, but applies it to European Parliament voting power per voter.",
              "Figure 1 shows the Gini coefficients for the European Parliament (EP) and that of several other parliaments. Voting power in the EP is outside the norm of individual European countries in terms of equality of representation. Germany, whose professed commitment to this principle is unparalleled among countries reviewed, is at the other end of the spectrum. Indeed, the European Parliament is at the low end in terms of electoral equality even beyond Europe.\n. Voting Gini coefficients\nHigher levels of inequality of representation may be expected in larger, more diverse polities where the political complexity of federal arrangements leads to awkward institutional compromises, which is definitely the case of the EU. In our sample, high voting Gini coefficients are indeed also observed for the lower houses in India and Brazil, which come closest to the EP on that measure. For example, in Brazil voters from Sao Paulo state are notoriously underrepresented. Yet the US and Indonesia, which are also large and diverse, both display comparatively low voting Gini coefficients.\nHow much change would produce an acceptable level of equality of representation? \nRead in a different light, Figure 1 suggests that the European Parliament would not need to go all the way to representative equality as high as the German Bundestag to join the norm of lower chambers in democratic polities. This is important, since a modified distribution of seats that reduced the voting Gini coefficient to something like 10% could be achieved without entirely renouncing the Treaty principle of \u2018degressive proportionality\u2019 as currently implemented by the European Council. It would, however, require lowering the minimum of six MEP seats per member state, and thus a modification of the Treaty on European Union.",
              "The EU Treaties stipulate that \u2018Representation of citizens should be degressively proportional, with a minimum threshold of six members [of the European Parliament] per Member State. No Member State shall be allocated more than ninety-six seats\u2019 (Article 14(2) of the Treaty on European Union). The ratio between the maximum and minimum (96/6) is 16 to 1, while the ratio between voting-age populations of the largest and smallest members (Germany and Luxembourg, respectively) is more than 172 to 1. However, no specific formula for representation is provided, and the exact composition is to be adopted by unanimous decision of the European Council. The latest apportionment decision was adopted in June 2013, in the run-up to the accession of Croatia as the EU\u2019s 28th member state.\nFor most countries reviewed, average voting-age population per government representative is based on the total population per relevant territorial subdivision (e.g. state or province), taken from each country\u2019s census bureau, and on the \u2018Voting-Age Population\u2019 (VAP) variable from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA)\u2019s database ()."

As the UK has already left the EU, an independent Scotland would need to apply to join under Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union after first completing its separation from the rest of the UK.

              "One of the most intense debates during the 2014 independence referendum was whether or not Scotland could maintain uninterrupted membership of the European Union if it became an independent country. The UK Government argued that the rest of the UK would be the \u2018continuing state\u2019 and would exclusively retain the rights and obligations of the UK\u2019s current membership. Consequently, Scotland would have to apply afresh to become an EU member after becoming independent. The Scottish Government, in contrast, took the view that as Scotland would already be fully compliant with the requirements of EU membership, there was every reason to believe the country would be able seamlessly to become an EU member in its own right.",
              "Of course, just two years after Scotland voted by 55% to 45% to remain inside the UK, the UK as a whole \u2013 though not Scotland itself \u2013 voted to Leave the EU. Eventually, after some years of political turmoil, the UK formally left the political institutions at the end of January 2020, while it exited the single market and customs union at the end of that year. As a result, the debate that was held in 2014 on the implications of independence for Scotland\u2019s membership of the EU has been overtaken by events. Perhaps, then, it was not entirely surprising that after it became clear that the UK was heading for a relatively \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit, in March 2017, just two and a half years after the original ballot, the then First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, called for a second independence referendum. That call has, of course, not been answered. But Brexit does mean that, unless there is a change in the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU, the choice with which Scotland\u2019s voters would be presented in a second independence referendum would not, as in 2014, simply be whether it should be inside or outside the UK, but, rather, whether it should be in the UK but outside the EU, or inside the EU but outside the UK. Doubtless, once again, part of the debate would be about whether and how easily an independent Scotland would be able to secure EU membership. However, now voters would be being asked whether it would be better for Scotland to seek EU membership rather than retain its current position in the UK.",
              "Moreover, this link between support for the EU and support for independence is underpinned by how people regard the consequences of the choice that Scotland now seems to face in its constitutional debate, that is, between being part of the UK but outside the EU and being part of the EU but outside the UK. On many issues voters are more likely to believe that being in the EU would be better for Scotland than they are to feel that being in the UK would be better \u2013 and these voters are highly likely to say they would vote Yes. However, while the balance of opinion may be more favourable to EU membership rather than being part of the UK, it is still the case that in most instances less than half believe that EU membership would be advantageous. Many are of the view that it would not make much difference and are also seemingly more inclined to stick with the status quo. Meanwhile, although Yes voters appear to have few qualms about signing up to freedom of movement, they are much less ready to embrace the euro, and more broadly the question of what currency an independent Scotland should use remains contentious.\nOf course, in practice little has happened in the debate about Scotland\u2019s constitutional status since the implementation of Brexit. The COVID-19 pandemic prevented any significant discussion of the issue, while more recently the SNP\u2019s political difficulties have left the party unable to make the political weather. As a result, voters have had little exposure to the issues that would arise in the choice between being in the UK and being part of the EU, and we cannot be sure what view they would form when they have heard more about the issues at stake. But what is now clearly the case is that it is a debate that will be crucial to how voters regard Scotland\u2019s constitutional future."

Rather than simply being a question of whether Scotland should be part of the UK, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, framed the choice facing the country as being \u201coutside the UK, but inside the EU\u201d, versus being \u201cinside the UK but outside the EU\u201d. \nIn short, any future referendum on independence would be as much about Brexit as it would be about Scotland\u2019s relationship with the rest of the UK.\nThis, perhaps, is not surprising.

              "The question of whether Scotland could rejoin the EU if it left the UK was much debated in 2014\u2019s independence referendum (the Yes side said it would, the No campaign that it would not). At that point there did not appear to be a strong link between voters\u2019 attitudes towards the EU and their attitudes towards independence. According to the , 49% of voters with a sceptical outlook towards the EU (that is, they either thought that the UK should leave the EU or that the EU\u2019s powers should be reduced) voted for independence. Only slightly fewer \u2013 44% \u2013 of those who thought the EU should remain at least as powerful as it was voted the same way.\nThis pattern was also reflected in how people in Scotland voted two years later in the EU referendum.

Yet there has always been an element of the party\u2019s support that wished to avoid both the constraints of EU membership, as well as the limitations created by being part of the UK.\n## What has changed since 2016\nAfter the Brexit referendum, some voters began to reassess their attitudes towards independence in light of the decision to leave the EU. As the SNP anticipated, some who had voted No in 2014 and Remain in 2016 switched to backing independence. But these were counterbalanced by some who had voted Yes in 2014 but Leave in 2016, switching in the opposite direction to support Scotland remaining in the UK."

But it\u2019s also raised the issue, again, of Scottish independence, not least because a very comfortable majority, 62 percent, within Scotland voted for the U.K. to remain within the European Union. So there is this sense, particularly among nationalists in Scotland and among those who lead Scotland\u2014the Scottish National Party is the dominant force now\u2014that Scotland has been taken out of the EU against its will, expressed in the referendum.\nSo we now see a much closer alignment between the independence project and the project of European integration.

And you\u2019re absolutely right that developments in Northern Ireland and in Ireland, actually, with its relationship with the U.K., now that the U.K. is outside of the internal market, these things are being observed quite closely in Scotland.

              "The success of the Brexit Leave campaign in June 2016 and the subsequent exit process culminating in the EU-UK trade deal, negotiated at the end of 2020, has further heightened the debate in both Scotland and Northern Ireland about their citizens\u2019 preferred territorial status. As of this writing, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement has not prevented business disruption between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK nor between the UK and EU. Considering first the Scottish case, there has been much political discussion about whether Brexit justifies Scotland pursuing another independence bid, and the current governing Scottish National Party (SNP) supports a second independence referendum after the failed 2014 effort. After the SNP\u2019s success in the December 2019 general election, its leader Nicola Sturgeon claimed that the electoral success indicated that the party had a \u201c\u2026 renewed, refreshed and strengthened mandate\u201d to pursue a second referendum (), as the SNP claims that many Scots prefer being in the EU to being in the UK outside of the EU. To date, conservative governments under both Theresa May and Boris Johnson have denied the possibility of a second Scottish independence referendum.\nMost evidence on the evolution of the Scottish independence movement, prior to and just after the failed 2014 referendum, shows that both Scottish identity and beliefs about economic prospects of an independent Scotland are correlated with support for independence (e.g. , , , ; , , ). discuss the increasing salience of independence as an issue promoted by the SNP and how independence became a key political cleavage in the last 10\u201315 years, and show that the 2014 independence referendum itself accelerated this re-alignment where support for the SNP became increasingly due to pro-independence views. Support for independence appears to have increased since the failed 2014 referendum (, ), but there are few studies exploring the role that Brexit plays in such preferences.",
              "On the particular connection between the Scottish independence and Brexit, the debate prior to the failed referendum of 2014 and since has been premised partially on the assumption that a Scottish exit would allow it to re-enter EU. There is suggestive but not recent evidence that Scottish independence support is conditioned by expectations of international recognition. [Muro, Vidal, and Vlaskamp (2020)](javascript:;) find using 2014 survey experimental evidence that the prospect of international recognition increases support for independence; find weaker evidence that the prospect of EU recognition increases independence support on average, but that key sub-groups of Scots are more responsive to the possibility of such recognition. As with the above evidence on the role of economic expectations in the wake of possible independence, though, the causal role of expectations of EU recognition remains unclear (as such beliefs may not be separate from territorial preferences). Related, some have argued that a subset of SNP voters supported Leave strategically in order to produce the conditions for a second independence referendum ([Greene, Spoon, and Williams 2018](javascript:;)). This latter evidence however finds it difficult to disentangle the relationship between current territorial preferences and SNP support, and finds that a very large majority of independence supporters from 2014 also supported Remain; further, prior to Brexit, SNP leadership had strongly supported Remain. This set of findings provides suggestive support of the basic logic of territorial preferences being affected by negative shocks to the existing \u201cunion,\u201d but these previous data either come from prior to the Scottish referendum and Brexit (and the corresponding political fallout), or do not focus on Brexit scenarios. We draw on this evidence to argue that the role of Brexit scenarios should affect territorial views in Scotland."

              "# Scotland, independence, Brexit and the border\nThere is no doubt that Brexit has reenergised the campaign for independence in Scotland. The fact that Scotland had to leave the EU with the rest of the UK, despite 62% of Scots voting Remain in the Brexit referendum, created a grievance and a sense that Scotland\u2019s voice was being ignored.\nThe Brexit process has contributed to these feelings too. The Scottish government, along with the other devolved administrations, struggled to have any influence over Brexit negotiations. In preparing for Brexit, the UK government passed a series of laws that threaten to undermine the Scottish Parliament\u2019s law-making power. The [United Kingdom Internal Market Act](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4018581) is the most notable of these.\nAdding insult to injury, this Act was passed despite the Scottish Parliament (along with the Welsh Senedd) withholding its consent, against an established constitutional convention \u2013 known as the \u2013 which specifies that the UK Parliament will not normally pass laws in devolved areas without the consent of the devolved legislatures.\nThe Scottish government, led by the Scottish National Party, is committed to holding an independence referendum before the end of 2023. Rejoining the European Union will be central to its independence ambitions. But Brexit brings new challenges to the prospect of \u2018independence in Europe\u2019, and chief amongst these is the status of the border Scotland shares with England.\nFollowing Scottish independence, this would become an international border between Scotland and the UK; and if Scotland rejoined the EU, it would also become a new border between the EU and the UK.

          "answer": "**Report: Political Implications of the United Kingdom Rejoining the European Union**\n\n**Introduction**  \nThis analysis examines the political implications of the United Kingdom (UK) rejoining the European Union (EU), integrating findings from three sub-studies: (1) sovereignty and decision-making autonomy, (2) institutional representation and global influence, and (3) domestic political dynamics. Together, these dimensions illustrate how renewed EU membership would reshape the UK\u2019s governance, external engagement, and internal cohesion.\n\n---\n\n### **Section 1 \u2013 Sovereignty and Decision-Making Autonomy**  \nRejoining the EU would fundamentally alter the UK\u2019s political framework by reinstating the supremacy of EU law over domestic legislation. This would effectively reduce the absolute sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament while restoring formal UK influence in the creation of EU laws through participation in its institutions [1][2].  \n\nThe UK would be required to realign with EU regulatory, economic, and legal frameworks, which implies surrendering unilateral control over issues such as trade standards and migration. However, this trade-off comes with significant benefits\u2014namely, regaining frictionless access to the Single Market and the collective bargaining power of a major trading bloc [3][4].  \n\nIn the area of immigration, the UK would once again have to accept the principle of free movement of people, limiting its independent migration policy. In exchange, British citizens would regain reciprocal mobility rights across member states [3][4]. Importantly, membership could also stabilize internal political relationships by giving devolved governments, particularly Scotland and Northern Ireland, direct channels to engage with EU institutions, potentially easing internal political tensions [2].  \n\nOverall, sovereignty would be recalibrated rather than erased\u2014rejoining entails shifting certain autonomous powers toward a collaborative model of multilevel governance that enhances shared decision-making capacity [5][3][1][4][2].\n\n---\n\n### **Section 2 \u2013 Institutional Representation and Global Influence**  \nRejoining the EU would provide the UK with structured representation in major European institutions, enhancing its policy-making influence compared to its current role as an external actor.  \n\n| **Institution** | **UK Representation (If in EU)** | **Influence Characteristics** | **Comparison to Current Global Positioning** | **Citations** |\n|------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| European Parliament | 73 MEPs out of 751 (~9.7%) | Representation spread across UK constituencies; participation in major transnational party groups (e.g., S&D, ECR) | Embedded legislative influence within cross-national alliances stronger than current independent lobbying capacity | [1][2] |\n| European Commission | 1 Commissioner | Equal formal representation as all member states; traditionally bolstered by UK\u2019s economic and diplomatic weight | Direct participation in EU executive policymaking, surpassing current external influence in global institutions | [1] |\n| Council of the EU | Weighted vote under Qualified Majority Voting | Significant influence proportional to UK population; collaboration with major EU economies | Offers more structured regional power than current, less coordinated global role | [3][4] |\n\n*Analytical Commentary:*  \nRejoining would embed the UK within EU decision-making networks, granting integrated authority within the Parliament, Commission, and Council. Compared to its current standing\u2014where it must negotiate agreements as an outsider\u2014the UK\u2019s influence in global issues (such as trade, security, and climate governance) would likely increase by operating through collective European positions [1][2][3][4]. The trade-off involves substituting some national independence in favor of amplified regional leverage.\n\n---\n\n### **Section 3 \u2013 Domestic Political Dynamics**  \nDomestically, EU re-entry would have major ramifications across the UK\u2019s internal political landscape.  \n\nIn **Scotland**, rejoining would weaken the Scottish National Party\u2019s (SNP) longstanding argument that independence is necessary to secure EU membership, thereby potentially reducing secessionist momentum [1][2][3][6][9]. Additionally, reestablishment of EU frameworks would allow devolved governments to participate in shared policy areas, softening tensions created by post-Brexit centralization such as those linked to the UK Internal Market Act [6][8]. However, independence sentiment might not entirely dissipate due to enduring political and cultural aspirations for greater self-determination [3][5][7].  \n\nIn **Northern Ireland**, EU membership would simplify trade and regulatory relations with the Republic of Ireland by reintroducing common frameworks, easing the border and customs complexities created by Brexit. More broadly, rejoining would recalibrate governance relationships across the UK, fostering renewed intergovernmental cooperation and dialogue around the roles of devolved administrations within the union [1][2][3][6][9].\n\n---\n\n### **Synthesis and Conclusion**  \nRejoining the European Union would carry intertwined implications for sovereignty, external influence, and domestic cohesion. The UK would trade elements of regulatory and legislative autonomy for restored participation in influential EU decision-making arenas, gaining stronger regional and global leverage through collective governance. Internally, membership could alleviate some of the constitutional strains between Westminster and devolved governments by reinstating multilevel governance systems, though political aspirations for independence would persist in some regions.  \n\nIn sum, the political implications of rejoining the EU would be a fundamental rebalancing act\u2014exchanging national autonomy for enhanced collaborative power and stabilizing internal political relations while redefining the UK\u2019s global identity within a multilateral European framework [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9].\n\n---"

              "The EU is an important trade partner for the UK: in 2024, UK exports of goods and services to the EU were \u00a3358 billion (41% of all UK exports). Imports from the EU were \u00a3454 billion (51% of the UK total).\n## Trade affected by Brexit and other factors\nThe UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU changed fundamentally after Brexit. The UK is now outside the EU single market and customs union. While there are no tariffs on trade in goods with the EU, subject to certain conditions, other barriers to trade are now higher. Brexit has also led to changes in the way data on trade in goods with the EU is collected. There is a structural break in the data from January 2021.\nIt is important to remember, however, that other factors, such as the covid-19 pandemic, the Ukraine conflict and disruption to global supply chains, have affected UK trade with the EU and other countries.\n## Little growth in goods exports\nThe UK\u2019s recent trade performance in services has been much better than that for goods. UK goods exports to the EU fell sharply in January 2021 after the end of the Brexit transition period, before recovering strongly in February 2021. Goods exports to the EU remain below their pre-pandemic/Brexit level, however: in 2024, goods exports to the EU were 18% below their 2019 level in real terms. It is important to point out, however, that goods exports to the EU were growing slowly before Brexit and the pandemic. In addition, exports to non-EU countries in 2024 were also 14% below their 2019 level in real terms.\nUK exports of services to both EU and non-EU countries fell in 2020 but have grown strongly since then. In 2024, UK exports of services to the EU were 19% above their 2019 level in real terms. Exports to non-EU countries were 23% above their 2019 level.\n## EU share of UK trade"

              "#  How has Brexit changed EU\u2013UK trade flows?\nAuthor links open overlay panel, \nThis paper estimates how  has affected goods trade between the United Kingdom and . Using product-level trade flows between the EU and all other countries in the world as a comparison group, we find a sharp decline in trade from the UK to the EU and significant but smaller reductions in trade from the EU to the UK. However, when we estimate the size of the impact on trade using UK data and UK global trade as a benchmark, we find strikingly different results. We identify two key sources of this discrepancy. First, the UK\u2019s global exports grew relatively slowly. We argue these are not suitable as a no-Brexit counterfactual. Second, Brexit also led to breaks in the measurement of trade flows, particularly for the EU imports data. To resolve these issues, we combine UK-reported data for its trade with EU and EU data for its trade with the rest of the world to use as the appropriate benchmark for comparison. This generates an estimate that Brexit reduced trade by close to 20% in both directions.\nFollowing the decision to leave the European Union (EU) taken by a referendum in the United Kingdom (UK) in June 2016, a process of extensive negotiations on the withdrawal arrangements and future trading relationship began. These continued up until days before the agreed (and several times rescheduled) exit of the UK from the EU\u2019s Single Market and Customs Union on 31st December 2020. In the intervening years, many potential scenarios on the degree of continued trade links were considered and a wide literature on the potential impacts of Brexit emerged. These covered the impacts on the UK, the EU as a whole, individual member states and specific sectors. The immediate impact of the uncertainty induced by the referendum on economic outcomes led to negative impacts on investment and exports during the period before the UK official exit from the EU.",
              "The second reason for divergence in the estimated effects of Brexit is the difference in data sources. The exit of the UK from the EU Single Market resulted in data collection changes, which caused a noticeable discrepancy in values that EU and UK statistical agencies report for the same trade flow. We find that collection methods for bilateral EU\u2013UK trade changed less in the UK-reported data than in the EU-reported data. Therefore, we suggest the most accurate estimation of the impact of Brexit can be found by combining EU data for its trade with the rest of the world (to obtain the comparison group) with UK data as the source for bilateral UK\u2013EU trade. Using this \u2018hybrid\u2019 dataset, we find that Brexit has substantially reduced trade in both directions relative to the no-Brexit benchmark. In our baseline model, UK to EU trade declined by 16% and trade from EU to UK by 24%. We further examine the variation across member states, product types, time horizons and role of extensive and intensive margin.\nThe paper is organised as follows: Section 2 gives a descriptive overview of the evolution of UK trade with the EU and rest of the world before and Brexit. Section 3 goes into detail on data and measurement issues. Section 4 describes the methodology and presents the initial estimations from the separate EU-reported and UK-reported data. It then discusses the key reasons why they give different results. In Section 5 we show our baseline estimates of the impacts of Brexit on trade between the UK and the EU using the hybrid dataset. We examine the effects on aggregate EU trade and on member states and discuss some robustness checks. Section 6 examines how the results vary across sectors, time and also by intensive and extensive margins of trade. Section 7 concludes.\n## Descriptive evidence on the evolution of UK\u2013EU and UK-RoW trade",
              "In this section, we set the scene for our analysis by presenting some descriptive patterns of trade both bilaterally between the EU and UK before and after Brexit and also how the trade of both economies with the rest of the world grew in the same period. Two aspects of this are particularly important. The first is the percentage of total trade accounted for by each economy in the other\u2019s aggregate international trade, which will influence the overall economic importance of any shock to\nThis section describes the EU and UK trade data and discusses some changes in methodology that occurred at the same time as the UK exit from the EU.\nThe baseline specification is to estimate the following: where represents trade flows into and out of (either the EU27 total or a specific member country), to each partner country of product in month . is a dummy equal to one for each month following the referendum (from July 2016 onwards), including 2021. is a dummy variable equal to one for each month following the exit of the UK from the EU (i.e. from\n## Estimates of Brexit using a hybrid dataset\nHaving established that both data differences and choice of comparison group contribute to the divergent results, how substantial is the effect on our estimated baseline coefficients?

In other words, we take the HMRC data as \u201ctruth\u201d and use those values for EU\u2013UK trade while having EU trade with the rest of the world as our comparison group. This way we have what we believe is"

              "Brexit introduced a major policy shift with respect to UK-EU trade relations and, by extension, non-EU relations. Given the importance of the EU market for UK goods and services, this shift was expected to impact UK economic performance in several areas. Portes () summarizes the evidence of this effect on three dimensions (trade, immigration, and investment). He concludes that UK trade has negatively suffered, consistent with predictions; that the impact on immigration has been much less negative than expected due to a sharp rise in immigration from outside the EU which has compensated, to some degree, the reduced immigration from the EU; and that the impact on investment has been somewhat more negative than expected. In addition to its impact on UK-EU trade, Brexit also affected trade between the UK and non-EU countries as agreements between the EU and third parties ceased to apply to the UK on exit. The effect of Brexit, though, is unlikely to be uniform both across sectors and across the many EU and non-EU countries that the UK trades with. For example, Portes and Springford () suggest that while there is some shortfall in migration for work, the impacts differ considerably between sectors. Bailey et al. () assert that the introduction of non-tariff barriers arising from Brexit has been particularly more challenging for smaller firms in the manufacturing supply chain.",
              "Brexit was a major change in the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU. Dhingra et al. () consider Brexit as the largest change in the UK\u2019s relationships globally in over half a century. It was inevitable that the exit process would be disruptive for several reasons. Firstly, disentangling decades of economic as well as institutional integration was bound to be challenging. In addition, it was not clear (until several years after the vote) what type of trade deal the UK and EU would be able to strike and implement post-Brexit. While trade rules would not change for several years after the vote, it was clear that Brexit would eventually introduce a new trade environment in the UK-EU relationship in the form of tariff and non-tariff barriers (or in the best-case scenario, non-tariff barriers only). Furthermore, the exit process was fraught with delays, ultimately culminating in the establishment of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) signed in December 2020. The TCA came into force in January 2021, reflecting the post-Brexit environment. Secondly, the UK was an economically important member of the EU. In 2016, the UK\u2019s contribution to the EU\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) stood at 16%, ranking second after Germany which contributed 21.1% to the EU\u2019s GDP, and just ahead of France which contributed 15% (Eurostat ). In 2015, a year before Brexit, 44% of UK exports of goods and services went to the EU, while 53% of UK imports came from the EU (ONS ). Since then, these ratios have gradually reduced. In 2022, about 42% of UK exports of goods and services went to the EU, and 48% of UK imports came from the EU (Ward and Webb ).",
              "Brexit is expected to have different impacts on UK trade with different countries. This heterogeneity across countries warrants analysis. With the UK out of the EU, a significant number of new trade negotiations will be at the bilateral level. Therefore, it is useful to understand the impact Brexit has had on UK trade with some of its key trading partners. This is a line of inquiry that is still faced with a paucity of literature. To help fill this gap, this study aims to assess the effect of Brexit on bilateral trade between the UK and EU member countries, as well as between the UK and key non-EU trading partners. Hence, unlike Kren and Lawless (), we enhance the bilateral effect analysis to also cover non-EU countries as well as EU countries with an extended dataset up to 2022Q3. The main question addressed in this study is how the change in the trade environment due to Brexit impacted UK trade with EU member countries and with major non-EU trading partners. While the Brexit vote happened in 2016, there was no change in trade rules until 2021. Therefore, technically, the underlying trade frictions had not changed in practice for most of the duration of this study. In any case, the focus of the current study is not to extract measures of trade frictions or border effects, but to show the differences in trade between pre-vote and post-vote regimes. By treating Brexit as a policy change, this study follows a long list of research that used this approach (use a variety of policy change dummies) to capture the effect of trade policy changes \u2013 for example, integration changes, such as monetary unions, or regional trade agreements (e.g., Dursun ; Micco, Stein, and Ordo\u00f1ez ; Brouwer, Paap, and Viaene ; among others). In this regard, we look at Brexit as a (dis)integration policy move"

              "In this paper, we assess the impact of the 2016 Brexit referendum itself and the introduction of the TCA on the geography of UK trade. Specifically, we examine the impact on trade between the United Kingdom and the 27 EU Member States with monthly data up to December 2021. We do so comparing UK\u2013EU trade to other trade flows as detailed in the methodological section. Estimation of the impacts of the TCA effect is made challenging by two concurring issues: the Covid-19 pandemic which disrupted economies and the sharp rise in shipping cost \u2013 which were also in large part a consequence of Covid-19. Similarly, the analysis of the effect of the referendum might be affected by other confounders. In order to isolate the impact of the referendum and of the TCA from other forces we apply a series of econometric techniques, which are difference-in-differences (DD), triple difference (DDD) and synthetic control (SC). In our principal regressions, we use total trade flows. It is possible that Covid may have had different impacts on different countries\u2019 trade; there may have been a differential impact on trade in Covid-related products which thus affects our aggregate regressions and/or Covid may have impacted differentially across sectors also affecting our aggregate regression. As discussed in Section 2 on the empirical strategy, we control and test for each of these possibilities.\nIt is important to note that in this paper we do not examine the impact on total UK trade to all destinations. Our focus is on UK trade with the EU. This is because, , if Brexit were to impact on trade, in the first instance we would expect this to impact on relative trade with the EU. Nevertheless, the aggregate trade effects are clearly of interest.",
              "As an EU Member State, the United Kingdom was part of the EU\u2019s Customs Union and part of the EU Single Market. The Single Market applies to countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Leaving the EU entailed a departure from each of these for the United Kingdom, but differentially for Great Britain and for Northern Ireland. Hence, Great Britain left both the Customs Union and the Single Market. In contrast, Northern Ireland remains in the EU\u2019s Single Market for goods, but not for services, and while not part of the Customs Union, remains part of the EU\u2019s common customs territory. The departure from the Customs Union and the Single Market has impacted the degree of market access between the United Kingdom and the EU (and the United Kingdom and third countries) in different ways. The changes in market access and the increase in firms\u2019 costs thus involve a combination of tariff barriers, administrative barriers and regulatory barriers.\nDeparture from the Customs Union means that the United Kingdom is free to set its own most favoured nation (MFN) tariffs on imported goods and is able to sign free trade agreements with third countries. The UK\u2019s MFN tariff was established in May 2020 and is commonly referred to as the UK Global Tariff (UKGT). To date, the United Kingdom has also managed to sign new free trade agreements with the EU (2021), Japan (2020), Australia (2022) and New Zealand (2022). The United Kingdom has also signed a series of \u2018continuity agreements\u2019 with those countries which have a free trade agreement with the EU, and consequently as did the United Kingdom when it was a member of the EU. The aim of the continuity agreements is to replicate as closely as possible the previous arrangements.",
              "The departure of the United Kingdom from the EU, as a process of trade policy \u2018disintegration\u2019 is a somewhat unprecedented policy change, which thus limits the existing relevant empirical literature. Regarding the possible impact on the United Kingdom, there is small literature on the impact of the Brexit referendum on the UK\u2013EU trade, mostly focusing on the effect of uncertainty. show that firms\u2019 entry into exporting to the EU was reduced in the first 6 months after the referendum as a consequence of an MFN tariff threat. use odds from the betting market to track the evolution of the Brexit referendum uncertainty over time, and show that the MFN threat started to affect the UK\u2013EU trade even before the referendum of June 2016. Looking at aggregate bilateral trade between the United Kingdom and 14 EU Member States, apply the SC method and find that the UK\u2013EU trade started to decline after the 2015 general election won by the Conservative party. look at the response of Portuguese exporters to the United Kingdom following the 2016 referendum. Comparing firm-level exports with the United Kingdom and other destinations, the authors find a decrease in export prices and volumes to the United Kingdom after the referendum, with heterogeneous effects along exporters and products. Work by using a large data set from a major UK retailer finds that following Brexit there was a switch of demand by UK consumers, with a 6% increase towards UK-produced goods, and a reduction of 13% away from EU goods."

              "Although the benefits of foreign direct investment (FDI) are well established in the economic literature, there remains a dearth of analysis of its impact within the European integration experience. Inward FDI is a major contributor to the diffusion of managerial best practices (Bloom et al 2012). It increases competition and shores up technological innovation (Alfaro et al 2004, Dhingra et al 2016). Also it should be more resilient than other international capital flows. Yet the literature estimating the FDI premium from EU membership remains scarce. European integration may have played a significant role and we need to get a good grasp of its effects.\nAnother reason to examine this issue is the comparison between the trade and the FDI impact of deep economic integration, of which the European integration experience is a textbook example. Focusing exclusively on trade, Glick and Rose (2016) find that earlier estimates of the effect of currency unions vanish when estimated using modern econometric techniques. Most of these techniques became standard after they published their original paper (Glick and Rose 2002). We ask whether the use of modern econometric techniques eliminates the effects of EU membership on FDI. We find that it does not, .\nFigure 1 shows FDI net inflows for the three largest economies in the EU. The UK is by far the largest recipient. Net FDI inflows were small until the mid-1990s but exhibit two periods of rapid expansion \u2013 one in the second half of the 1990s and the other between the dot-com bubble and the financial crisis. It is also worth noting that these flows are much more volatile than expected, which may reflect the increasing share of more \u2018footloose\u2019 service activities, especially finance.",
              "This column reports new estimates of the FDI premium from EU membership. We find that, between 1985 and 2013, EU membership increased FDI inflows by 28% (Bruno et al. 2016). This is a large, significant, and memorable effect \u2013 a percentage point for each of the 28 EU members. Our estimates for the FDI premium are robust and they range from 14% (Heckman) to 33% (OLS) to 38% (Poisson estimates). They survive the Glick-Rose critique and do so comfortably. However, and more importantly, they help advocate for FDI as a channel (in addition to trade) for delivering substantial payoffs from deep integration.\n. Foreign direct investment in France, Germany and the UK, 1970-2014 (net inflows, BoP, current US$)\n: World Bank World Development Indicators 2015.\nThe gravity model has been a staple of international economics. It explains bilateral cross-border flows (trade, migration, investment, etc) based on the relative size and distance between countries or regions (Baldwin and Taglioni 2011, Head and Mayer 2014). A country\u2019s economic size is expected to have a positive effect on bilateral flows while distance is expected to have a negative effect (distance is often taken to reflect a whole range of trade costs including language, bureaucracy, culture, etc). The last two decades have witnessed enormous progress in this area. Among many influential pieces, Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) and Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) are the crucial ones for our purposes. This new structural gravity approach (Fally 2015) provides needed theoretical underpinnings as well as strong support for the econometric estimation of gravity models. \nIn Bruno et al. (2016), we estimate the impact of EU membership on FDI. We used the latest available data on bilateral FDI flows, GDP and GDP per capita (sender and target), bilateral distance and the shares of manufacturing output, exports and imports in total GDP.",
              "How does our 28% estimate compare with and relate to other estimates in the literature? Straathof et al. (2008) use a gravity model to examine bilateral FDI stocks. One of their specifications uses dyadic fixed effects, a somewhat different set of controls and earlier data (1981-2005). They find that EU membership yields a 28% increase in its inward FDI stocks from other EU countries and a 14% increase from non-EU countries (their Table 5.1, column 2). Bevan and Estrin (2004) focus on the new EU member states and show that even the announcement of start of EU membership negotiations has a positive and significant effect on FDI inflows. We can also look at the bilateral trade flows literature for a comparison, but we need to bear in mind that we focus on bilateral FDI in our model. Baier et al. (2008) find that trade is increased by about 130% after 10 to 15 years of EU membership, while the similar impact of EFTA membership is about 35%. We find instead that EU membership increases FDI inflows by about 28% in a country that is a member of the EU, which may be because trade is easier to adjust than FDI flows. This may help further our understanding of how benefits from deep integration actually take root (Campos et al. 2015).\nHow much additional FDI does a country receive as a consequence of being a member of the EU? This is obviously an important question for which, surprisingly, one still finds very few answers. We find EU membership robustly increases net FDI inflows. Our three main estimates range between 14% and 38% depending on the choice of econometric technique. The average of these is 28%. This is a large, robust, significant, substantial, and memorable benefit \u2013 a percentage point for each of the 28 members of the EU. Moreover, this result has enormous implications for the European integration project and for countries, like the UK, that are currently considering substantial changes to the terms of their relationship with the EU."

Investment is volatile, and to a great extent, its performance is more difficult to grasp than trade ([Fern\u00e1ndez-Pacheco Theurer et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999324001846#bib28)); however, the potential emergence of restrictions on cross-border investment due to Brexit suggests that the total cost of leaving the  (EU) is likely to be larger than previous estimations based only on trade.

According to its 3 alternative scenarios, the UK would face a fall in FDI flows by 10% under the European Economic Area membership, between \u221215% and \u221220% under an FTA with the EU or a reduction between 18% and 26% in the \u2018no deal\u2019 case. These results have been used to model the overall macro-economic impact of leaving the EU. calculate that the FDI stock would decrease by 34%. Conversely, predict a 22% decrease in FDI inflows in the UK after leaving the EU.\nThe empirical studies analysing and FDI find a positive relationship. This result is typical in economic integration processes, in general, but seems to be even more pronounced in the case of EU integration, and it is also confirmed by studies focusing on Brexit. Most studies cited above focus on estimating the size of the reduction in FDI stock or flows but did not evaluate its resulting impact, which is the focus of our paper.\nThe few papers which estimate the impact of a reduction on FDI in the UK after Brexit include the analysis of Dhingra et al., 2017, , , , , and .\nDhingra et al., 2017 and evaluate the impact of FDI flow reductions in the UK.

Overall, they find that regional integration affects FDI entry positively. find evidence that a regional integration agreement (such as the EU membership) would increase the stock of FDI by around 27%.  estimates that a reduction of 20% in regulatory differences increases FDI inflows by 15% and suggests that belonging to the EU single market can have an additional positive impact on FDI flows beyond the effects of traditional agreements (FTAs). This postulation makes sense, given that the EU is the world's most integrated economic area (i.e. with the lowest regulatory barriers across different countries).\nFurther studies focus on the impact of the on FDI flows. For example,  examine the impact of EU membership on the Central and Eastern European economies. They find that key announcements around EU accession increased FDI inflow to the applicant countries. found that FDI to Spain expanded due to its EU accession and was crucial in promoting productivity growth. and found that the inward FDI in Spain and Portugal increased significantly after accessing the EU in 1986. Similar results were found for the UK, Ireland, Spain and Sweden (). also confirm the increase in FDI inflows for the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden. FDI inflows seem to rise when a country becomes part of the EU.  estimate the impact of a potential enlargement of the European (EMU) to the 10 countries that obtained EU membership in 2004. They estimate that the FDI inflow would rise by around 21%."

              "When it comes to letterbox firms, systemic risk would decline if UK firms moved more substance to the continent, and an EU-UK agreement could pave the way for improvements. It is not in UK supervisors\u2019 interest to allow cross-border fragility to pile up. A stronger and safer market will encourage growth, offsetting any initial shifts in business.\nSupervisors also need new ways to manage Brexit-related fragmentation of investment-firm oversight. Luxembourg harbours around \u20ac5.5 trillion in assets under management \u2013 more than the UK and almost double the size of what is held Germany or France. Yet many asset management firms in Luxembourg delegate portfolio management. There is a concern that these firms are mainly \u2018letterbox entities\u2019, with minimal presence in Luxembourg and real decision-making, risk management and other functions carried out in London. This could undermine proper oversight, as firms might have incentive to seek out low-regulation entry points into the EU while conducting real operations elsewhere. It does not help the UK to have its firms seeking out laxer rules for their cross-border business. A high-level agreement on common standards and manageable compliance burdens could help both sides.\nAs tensions recede, it is worth exploring how London could better serve as a hub for foreign direct investment into the EU. The UK is second overall, after the United States, representing 25 percent of all acquisitions and 21 percent of greenfield projects in the single market (European Commission, 2024). After Brexit, total FDI levels from the UK into the EU dropped by about one quarter, although the extent to which other jurisdictions may have stepped in is unclear, as some inflows originated from London-based non-UK firms. In any case, the UK can act as a single point of entry for many global firms into the EU, and the EU should welcome such investment."

              "The initial literature that examined the potential effect on FDI flows on a country's accession to a customs union essentially extended the well-understood concepts of \u2018trade creation\u2019 and \u2018trade diversion\u2019 to the issue of FDI. This then makes a series of predictions concerning both FDI flows into a country from outside the customs union, and also regarding intraunion FDI. Much of the analysis that seeks to link FDI decisions of firms to country level decisions regarding economic integration is based on the analysis of Rowthorn ().\nThese can be summarized as follows: firstly, that a country's membership of a customs union makes it more attractive for inward investment from outside the region (Collie, ), with a general increase in \u2018interbloc\u2019 FDI (Donnenfeld, ). This is in turn related to the \u2018optimal tariff\u2019 literature; see for example Blonigen and Cole (), who applied the model of Blanchard () to the case of Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization. Theoretically, one could adopt a similar analysis to the case of Brexit, concluding that the UK may seek to attract \u2018tariff jumping\u2019 FDI at the expense of the EU. This is, however, not a position that those advocating Brexit have yet adopted, for fear that retaliation from the EU would cause a reduction in FDI to the UK from outside the EU. Bajo-Rubio and L\u00f3pez-Pueyo () for example argued that Spain became more attractive for non-EU inward investment as the EU moved towards the single market in 1992.",
              "Since the outcome on the UK's exit (\u2018Brexit\u2019) from the European Union (EU) referendum there has been much comment on the likely nature of the UK's trading relationship with the EU and the rest of the world. However, despite its importance to the UK economy, the effect on inward foreign direct investment (FDI) received little comment during the referendum debate, and only more recently have the positions of, for example, the Japanese car makers in the UK been the focus of attention. This is despite the fact that the UK has been for 40 years not merely open to inward investment but has actively sought foreign investment across all sectors. Many UK and non-UK firms have taken the opportunity to develop supply chains that cross into and out of the UK several times. The position of these firms, and the capacity for the UK to continue to attract inward FDI, is potentially one of the most important economic aspects of the UK's leaving the EU.\nIt is well known that the UK has a long running trade deficit, but what has received much less attention is the extent to which the adverse long-term effects of this have been offset by the quantity of inward FDI that the UK attracts. Hitherto, any analysis of the likely effect of Brexit in terms of firm location decisions has focused on seeking to explore the extent to which such decisions have historically been influenced by the UK's membership of the EU. A more targeted approach would be to explore the short and long-term dynamics of FDI into the UK, and to use them to infer the implications of Brexit. This is the approach that we propose. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to explore the likely effect on inward investment of Brexit, with a particular focus on distinguishing between the long-term drivers of inward investment into the UK, and the effect of short-term volatility.",
              "Even more interestingly, Brexit raises a more general issue that the literature on FDI has yet to address. In particular, there has been a plethora of papers focusing on the effect of joining a free-trade area or a customs union and especially the EU; still, we know surprisingly little about a reverse move, leaving a free-trade area or a customs union, since the noteworthy instances are too few to draw even speculative conclusions. (The Seychelles and Madagascar left the Southern African Development Community for a period, and membership of the Central European Free Trade Agreement when a country joins the EU. To the best of our knowledge these are the only examples of countries leaving a customs union.) The naive approach, which was sometimes offered by politicians in the run up to the referendum and indeed by some for the 12 months up to the 2017 UK general election but dismissed almost unanimously by policy makers, academics and the popular press, would be simply to assume that the effect on FDI would simply be zero, with new opportunities offsetting any detrimental effects. And yet, what may happen to (inward) FDI is more than an important concern; it is a centrepiece economic criterion to make a decision to remain or not in a free-trade area or a customs union. Given that the country that considers such a move is the UK, and that the union that it involves is the EU, having a framework to study how FDI could possibly react to such an event is as timely an issue as it can ever be."

          "answer": "**Report: Economic Implications of the United Kingdom Rejoining the European Union**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Trade and Market Access Analysis  \nEvidence from Child 1 indicates that EU membership would substantially increase trade intensity between the UK and the EU by restoring tariff-free, frictionless trade and removing non-tariff barriers such as customs checks and divergent regulatory standards. Reintegration into the **Single Market and Customs Union** would eliminate tariffs on intra-EU trade and reduce border friction, strengthening supply chain efficiency and predictability [1][2][3][4].  \n\nThe reestablishment of unified external tariffs and the elimination of rules-of-origin requirements would further simplify cross-border operations and reduce administrative costs. Standardized regulations and unrestricted Single Market access across goods, services, capital, and labor imply a meaningful restoration of competitive advantage in export-oriented and service-heavy sectors, including financial services, manufacturing, and logistics [1][3][4].  \n\nEconomically, these changes would likely lead to a significant boost in exports and imports, improving the trade balance with Europe but potentially constraining independent trade policy autonomy. Overall, reintegration would deepen economic interdependence with European partners, trading some sovereignty for efficiency and scale benefits [2][3][4].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Investment and Labor Impacts  \nAccording to Child 2, rejoining the EU could raise **foreign direct investment (FDI)** in the UK by approximately **14\u201338%**, primarily through renewed investor confidence, increased regulatory alignment, and restored financial integration [1][2][3]. The UK would once again function as a strategic entry point for global investors targeting the European market, reversing post-Brexit FDI losses (estimated at 10\u201334%) [2].  \n\nThis renewed investment environment would foster technology spillovers, productivity gains, and enhanced managerial practices linked to deeper integration within the EU economic framework [1].  \n\nIn parallel, the restoration of **free movement of labor** would alleviate sectoral labor shortages and reestablish reciprocal workforce mobility across EU member states. Reopened labor channels could mitigate demographic pressures in key industries such as healthcare, agriculture, and hospitality, while facilitating the return of UK nationals to EU employment markets.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Synthesis and Macroeconomic Interpretation  \nSynthesizing insights from both nodes, rejoining the EU would generate positive macroeconomic outcomes through stronger trade linkages, revived investment flows, and increased labor flexibility. The combination of frictionless trade and greater capital inflows would likely contribute to GDP growth and improved productivity, particularly in sectors dependent on cross-border inputs and skills.  \n\nAt the regional level, manufacturing clusters in the Midlands and Northern England could benefit from restored supply chain efficiencies, while London and the Southeast would see heightened financial and service-sector investment. Fiscal implications may include higher tax revenues through expanded economic activity, partly offset by EU membership contributions. Monetary policy considerations would remain under domestic control, but closer economic alignment with Europe could enhance currency stability and investor sentiment.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Conclusion  \nOverall, the net economic outlook of the UK rejoining the European Union appears **strongly positive** in the medium to long term. Trade and investment gains, coupled with improved labor mobility, would outweigh short-term adjustments and reduced trade policy autonomy. Citing the trade mechanisms described in Child 1 [1][2][3][4] and the capital and workforce dynamics detailed in Child 2 [1][2][3], EU reentry would likely bolster productivity, competitiveness, and growth\u2014reestablishing the UK as an integrated player in the European and global economy.\n\n---"

              "This historical context sets the stage for the debate on the resolution: \u201cThe United Kingdom should rejoin the European Union.\u201d Below, we present the major arguments on both sides of this question, as of 2025, considering economic, political, social, legal, and geostrategic dimensions. The perspectives of stakeholders within the UK, in the EU, and internationally will be noted, drawing on the developments of both the pre-Brexit and post-Brexit periods.\n## Arguments in Favor of the UK Rejoining the EU\nAdvocates for the UK (\u201cRejoiners\u201d) argue that Brexit has been detrimental in numerous ways, and that renewed EU membership would yield significant benefits. Their case spans economic gains, political influence, social opportunities, diplomatic and security advantages, legal alignment , and broader strategic considerations. Proponents draw on evidence from the Brexit experience \u2013 pointing to losses incurred since 2020 \u2013 as well as the advantages the UK used to enjoy as an EU member. Below are the major pro-rejoin arguments in 2025:\n### Economic Benefits and Market Access",
              "Finally, at the level of global trade talks and standards, the EU\u2019s clout far exceeds the UK\u2019s alone. A rejoined UK would be part of one of the two biggest rule-making entities in the global economy (the EU and US). This means more with powers like China or the United States. For instance, if the EU sets data privacy standards (as it did with GDPR) or negotiates trade terms, the UK as a member would benefit from those, whereas outside it often ends up aligning with EU rules anyway (to access the market) but without any control. In summary, the political argument is that EU membership empowers British influence , both within Europe and globally, far more than the \u201csplendid isolation\u201d Brexit was supposed to grant. Britain may have \u201ctaken back control\u201d on paper, but in reality being outside has often meant over the European decisions that matter. Rejoining would remedy that.\n### Social, Cultural, and Mobility Advantages",
              "Socially, EU membership also implies being part of a broader European community. Many in the UK feel European and welcomed the cultural exchange that came with membership \u2013 from ease of tourism to town twinning to collaborative projects in arts and science. Rejoining would reaffirm common values and collaboration with neighbors. This has intangible benefits: for instance, it could reduce the sense of insularity and mend some of the societal polarization that Brexit induced. Free movement is not just about work \u2013 it facilitates cross-cultural understanding, familial ties (there are countless binational families who have struggled with the new residency rules), and the general openness of society. Proponents often mention that Britons were living in other EU countries pre-Brexit (in Spain, France, etc.), and a similar number of EU citizens were long-term residents of the UK. Brexit complicated their lives with new bureaucratic hurdles. Rejoining would resolve the status of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU at a stroke , by reinstating their automatic rights."

              "This increased support for a different kind of relationship with the EU seems to be mostly driven by the changing attitudes among some 2016 Leavers, who appear to have become more unsure about the effects of Brexit. Within the next ten to 15 years, nearly one in five Leave voters (18 per cent) would either like the UK to re-join the EU or the single market and a further 45 per cent would like to see a closer relationship or see the UK in a new kind of association with the EU.\nIn considering what these findings mean for future government policy and the UK\u2019s post-Brexit relationship with the EU, we suggest that:\n  * There is a need for Britain\u2019s political leaders to openly acknowledge the immediate consequences of Brexit and set out a plan to fix them. A substantial majority of the public, including Leave voters, think that Brexit has had a negative impact on their lives \u2013 and there is no political prize for shying away from the conversation about the costs of Brexit to date.\n  * Little public support exists for deregulation away from high standards in the pursuit of future trade deals. The British public overwhelmingly supports high standards on the environment, labour and social rights and food safety, even at the cost of not striking major trade agreements, suggesting that any deregulation agenda that lowers current protections will have extraordinarily low levels of public support.\n  * The British public is more pragmatic on Europe than is often portrayed by politicians and the media. While the public does simply want to move on from debating Brexit, the data show that voters tend to evaluate the trade-offs inherent in different choices in a pragmatic way. The public deserves honesty and transparency from political leaders about what consequences future choices will entail.",

Often acrimonious debates in the UK Houses of Parliament led, eventually, to the United Kingdom's formal departure from the EU on January 31, 2020, but, at the time of writing, disagreements continue about the economic and social consequences of the departure, with polling indicating that UK public opinion continues to be highly polarized on the issue (Curtice, )."

              "Barely one-fifth of respondents across the four biggest EU members, from 19% in Italy and to 21% in Spain and 22% in Germany, felt the UK should be allowed to return to the bloc on those terms, with 58-62% saying it must be part of all main EU policy areas.\nThe pollster stress-tested western European attitudes by asking whether, if the UK was only willing to rejoin the EU on condition it could keep its old opt-outs, it should be allowed to. Some (33-36%) felt this would be acceptable, but more (41-52%) were opposed.\nIn the UK, while 54% of Britons supported rejoining the EU when asked the question in isolation, the figure fell to just 36% if rejoining meant giving up previous opt-outs. On those terms, 45% of Britons opposed renewed membership.\nThe survey found that remain voters and those who backed more pro-EU parties would still broadly back rejoining if this meant adopting the euro and being part of the Schengen area, albeit at much lower rates.\nAlmost 60% of remain voters said they would support rejoining the EU without the previous opt-outs, down about 25 percentage points from the non-specific question, as would 58% of Labour voters (-23 points) and 49% of Liberal Democrats (-31 points).\nThe percentage of Eurosceptic voters willing to rejoin without the previous special treatment more or less halved, falling from 21% to 10% among leave voters; 25% to 12% among Conservative voters, and 15% to 9% among Reform UK supporters.\nThe fifth continental European country polled, Denmark, proved an outlier. Respondents there were very keen (72%) for the UK to rejoin, and more enthusiastic than larger member states about it keeping its previous opt-outs (43%).\nDenmark, however, is one of only three EU member states to hold opt-outs in major EU policy areas.

              "This does not mean that a Europeanised UK is destined to rejoin the EU. It would more than likely take another critical juncture to break the path dependence of the TCA\u2019s hard Brexit. Further, while the UK has engaged with European multilateralism, a distance has remained with the EU. The war in Ukraine has reminded British policy makers that the UK has withdrawn from the EU but not from Europe. But that has meant a focus on relations with European states through NATO (as discussed by Cladi) and, at some remove, with the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (Grogan ). It has also entailed a lot of muddling through in building links, especially bilateral ones, so as to avoid any formal UK-EU institutional setup on foreign policy coordination. The 2021 reflected this tone, making only a passing mention of the EU. This is not a sign of the EU\u2019s lack of importance to the UK\u2019s international relations; it is, rather, a sign of how such documents are drafted with political sensitivities in mind with geopolitics placed second. The 2015 UK also said very little about the EU, despite it being published shortly after the election of a government with a commitment to put to the British people one of the biggest foreign policy choices since 1945. That the EU remains the UK\u2019s most important multilateral relationship means the potential exists for closer UK-EU relations, but many decision makers remain uneasy at accepting this."

          "answer": "**Report: Social and Strategic Implications of the United Kingdom Rejoining the European Union**\n\n---\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nRejoining the European Union would mark a profound turning point for the United Kingdom, reversing one of the most consequential political decisions of the 21st century. The move would not only reconfigure Britain\u2019s international posture but also recalibrate its social, cultural, and identity-based foundations. According to existing analyses, such a shift would intertwine domestic renewal with external realignment, revealing that questions of belonging, cooperation, and strategy are inseparable in the post-Brexit context[1][2][4][5].\n\n---\n\n### **Social Implications**\n\nSocially, a return to EU membership would likely rejuvenate a shared European identity within the UK, reinstating the sense of cultural and institutional connection that characterized pre-Brexit life. Freedom of movement and enhanced collaboration in education, science, and culture would foster renewed interpersonal networks and intellectual exchange, strengthening ties between British and European citizens[1].  \n\nDomestically, re-accession could mitigate some of the divisions that Brexit created. As engagement with Europe became part of everyday life again, political polarization might decrease, fostering a more inclusive, outward-looking national discourse[1][2]. The population might gravitate toward a more pragmatic understanding of membership, prioritizing economic and societal gains over sovereignty-centered debates\u2014though a residual divide between integrationists and Euroskeptics would remain[2][3].  \n\nFinally, the UK\u2019s identity would evolve as it re-adapts to EU norms and governance, reshaping perceptions of British exceptionalism and reintroducing the country into shared European narratives of cooperation and diversity[4].\n\n---\n\n### **Strategic Implications**\n\nStrategically, EU re-membership would re-anchor the United Kingdom within the Western multilateral order. Rejoining would bolster Britain\u2019s role in collective European and NATO security frameworks, allowing it to exert greater diplomatic influence through joint policymaking structures[2][4][5].  \n\nEconomically and politically, the UK\u2019s return could reinvigorate partnerships strained since Brexit, offering renewed stability in trade relations and giving London an expanded voice in EU decision-making processes. This restoration of cooperative leverage would mark a pivot away from isolation toward renewed engagement in shared governance[4][5].\n\n---\n\n### **Interconnections**\n\nThe relationship between social cohesion and strategic posture would be reciprocal. A society more comfortable with European integration would empower policymakers to pursue deeper alliances, while successes in international cooperation could further validate domestic confidence in membership. Thus, identity alignment and geopolitical orientation would reinforce each other, shaping a cycle of integration that strengthens both internal unity and external influence[1][2][4].\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nIf the UK were to rejoin the European Union, the consequences would ripple across both society and statecraft. Socially, Britain would experience renewed cultural connection, softened political divisions, and a recalibration of identity around pragmatic Europeanism. Strategically, it would regain influence and stability through deeper participation in continental frameworks for security and governance. Together, these shifts suggest a long-term transformation, intertwining the revival of shared identity with the restoration of Britain\u2019s role as a cooperative European power[1][2][3][4][5].\n\n---\n\n**Citations:** [1][2][3][4][5]"

              "The of 2016 suggests that such votes might not go as polling suggests. In such a scenario, Leave parties might have lost the preceding general election, but they would still have considerable resources and activists to push a message that would inevitably revolve around how politicians want to overturn the 2016 decision.\nThe ability of campaigners to get voters to actually vote would be more constrained in any new vote, as they will face the additional hurdle of explaining why the public need to return to an issue that was supposedly settled only a few years ago. The legitimacy of a rejoin majority but with fewer votes than Leave last time would open a new point of attack from those who wanted to fight it.\nAt which point we run into the elephant in the room: rejoining isn\u2019t just up to the UK.\nThe EU holds all the over whether to let a country become a member: rejoining states don\u2019t get any special rights in that regard. Not only do you have to comply with entry requirements on political and economic capacity to manage the effects of membership, but you also have to get the explicit approval of all existing member states and of the European Parliament.\nNone of that is a given.\nAs times passes, the UK is diverging from EU standards. Moreover, as a new applicant the UK would be obliged to commit to being part of those bits of the EU that it used to have opt-outs on, like the Euro, Schengen and various bits of justice and home affairs.\nMember states and the EU Parliament might also have doubts about whether they want the UK back. They might be concerned, for example, that the UK would stymie certain policy agendas, since the UK would once more be getting to vote on things it dislikes (such as, possibly, the package with its debt financing)."

              "Another major pro-EU argument centers on . Inside the EU, the UK had a seat at the table in shaping European-wide decisions that inevitably affect its interests; outside, the UK has found it often must accept or adjust to EU decisions without a voice. Advocates for rejoining argue that Britain\u2019s global influence was amplified by being an EU member. The EU, with its combined economic weight and regulatory power, can set standards (from environmental rules to tech regulation) that smaller individual countries often end up following. As an EU member, the UK was one of the \u201cBig Three\u201d alongside Germany and France, and British diplomats and Members of the European Parliament had significant sway over EU policies. If the UK rejoined, it could once again help steer EU policy on trade, digital regulation, climate change, and more, rather than watching from the outside. This influence is seen as especially important given that many EU rules will affect the UK regardless \u2013 for instance, EU product standards must be met by UK companies exporting to Europe. It would be better to \u201cbe in the room\u201d and shape those rules than to be a rule-taker, proponents say.\nDomestically, rejoining the EU could also ease certain political tensions. For example, it might strengthen the unity of the UK itself. Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in 2016; Brexit has since fueled calls for Scottish independence and complicated governance in Northern Ireland. If the UK as a whole re-enters the EU, the pressure for Scotland to leave the UK in order to rejoin Europe might diminish. Essentially, UK-wide EU membership could remove one of the grievances that separatists cite (Scotland \u201cbeing taken out of the EU against its will\u201d). Some unionists argue this would help \u201ctake the wind out of the sails\u201d of Scottish independence sentiment and thus preserve the UK\u2019s integrity.",
              "Proponents also argue that rejoining would affirm the UK\u2019s commitment to . The EU\u2019s laws on things like food safety (e.g., banning certain additives), environmental law (water quality, air pollution limits), and digital regulation (like the GDPR for data privacy) set a benchmark. Since Brexit, the UK government has considered or enacted changes that diverge \u2013 for example, contemplating lowering food import standards or scrapping some EU-derived worker protections. Those in favor of EU membership worry this could lead to a erosion of standards in the long run (a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d). By rejoining, the UK would recommit to those shared high standards and eliminate the risk of regulatory rollback in areas where the EU leads. Essentially, it future-proofs certain rights and norms by binding the UK into the collective legal commitments of the EU.\nFinally, there\u2019s a constitutional argument: Brexit and its aftermath have been very consuming for the UK\u2019s governance, sparking legal battles (like the 2019 prorogation of Parliament case) and questions about the (Scotland and Northern Ireland\u2019s place in the Union). Some legal scholars in the pro-EU camp argue that rejoining could provide a stable framework for the UK\u2019s internal constitutional arrangements, because the EU\u2019s multilevel governance gives a voice to regions (Scotland and Wales could engage in EU forums) and lessens some conflicts. While this is a more abstract point, the idea is that the EU framework supports the rule of law and pluralism , which aligns with the UK\u2019s own constitutional values.",
              "In summary, legal alignment with the EU is portrayed as beneficial for consistency, rights, and standards. Rejoining would erase the legal fragmentation that Brexit created, making life simpler for businesses and citizens and ensuring that the UK operates under the robust legal regime that governs its neighbors. It would trade a bit of abstract sovereignty for a lot of practical legal cohesion and clout (since the UK would again help shape EU laws via the Council and Parliament).\nOn the global stage, proponents argue that both the UK and Europe as a whole would be geopolitically stronger if the UK rejoins the EU. We live in a time of \u2013 the United States and China are superpowers, Russia is an aggressive regional power, and new blocs are forming. Europe must remain united to assert its interests and values in this environment. A UK inside the EU makes the and creates a bloc of democracies in Europe that is more comparable in weight to the U.S. or China. Geostrategically, a reunited Europe including Britain would command greater respect in trade negotiations, climate negotiations, and in setting international standards."

              "> Effective U.K. autonomy depends more on the complex web of economic, social, and cultural interactions with the rest of the world than it does on the U.K. government\u2019s formal political power.\nEffective U.K. autonomy depends more on the complex web of economic, social, and cultural interactions with the rest of the world than it does on the U.K. government\u2019s formal political power. Those interactions inescapably erode the ability of the UK\u2019s government and citizens to make independent untrammeled decisions. Yes, the UK\u2019s membership in the European Union erodes formal sovereignty. Economic, social, and cultural interrelationships intentionally erode sovereignty. However, because of the cooperative relationships across the English Channel, the UK\u2019s membership in the European Union has on balance rather than eroded effective U.K. autonomy. British skeptics can legitimately argue that the EU Commission and its governments may have adopted excessive regulations. But skeptics cannot argue that those decisions were taken without U.K. participation. Whatever future decisions may be made about Brexit, moreover, many of the existing cooperative relationships with the EU are likely to be maintained\u2014precisely to forestall an unwanted deterioration in effective U.K. autonomy.\nAnti-EU sentiment can question not only whether economic relations with the EU have been conducted appropriately. EU skeptics may logically complain about unwanted immigration from Europe. They may logically assert that EU membership undermines U.K. culture and national identity. It would be unfortunate, however, if most Brits were to favor a Brexit because of superficial yearning for elusive sovereignty.",
              "Think of regulations and oversight about the production and marketing of medications. By agreement of all EU members including the UK, cooperative oversight throughout the EU is typically beneficial. The functions of the European Medicines Agency are to provide such oversight. If an exit-deal Brexit is to occur, cooperative adjustments need to be found to support some form of continuation of the EMA\u2019s oversight. Analogous comments apply to a wide range of issues that affect all members of the European Union. Another example highly important to the U.K. is the design of regulations and oversight for the provision of financial services throughout the EU.\nRegulation and oversight of immigration from Europe is more controversial. Some British residents complain, for example, that the free movement of labour within the EU has led to a surge of Europeans coming into the UK, taking jobs away from locals, flooding the schools with their children, committing crimes. Emotions can run high about threats to national culture and traditional ways of life. In turn the U.K. governments experience strong pressure to reduce the ease of movement of Europeans crossing the U.K. border.\nMost of the difficult issues will require UK-EU cooperation whether or not the U.K. finds itself outside the EU fence. The issue areas had to be addressed in the past while the U.K. was inside the European Union. They will need continued attention even if the U.K. chooses a no-Brexit remain."

Photo: iStock.\n  * The question of sovereignty lies at the heart of the UK\u2019s upcoming EU referendum. Many in Britain believe that the process of EU decision-making has undermined British parliamentary democracy, and that leaving the EU is the only way for the British people to regain control of their sovereignty.\n  * This ignores the fact that successive British governments have chosen to pool aspects of the country\u2019s sovereign power in the EU in order to achieve national objectives that they could not have achieved on their own, such as creating the single market, enlarging the EU, constraining Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, and helping to design an ambitious EU climate change strategy.\n  * Apart from EU immigration, the British government still determines the vast majority of policy over every issue of greatest concern to British voters \u2013 including health, education, pensions, welfare, monetary policy, defence and border security. The arguments for leaving also ignore the fact that the UK controls more than 98 per cent of its public expenditure.\n  * The British economy has prospered in the EU. The UK boasts higher economic growth and lower unemployment than most major developed economies. It attracts the most foreign direct investment in the EU, and is ranked among the most open places to do business in the developed world. British economic weaknesses, such as low growth in productivity, are self-inflicted.",
              "* However, a successful economy and free-movement rules have led to high levels of immigration from the EU. Overall, this has been positive for the UK economy, but it has exacerbated preexisting pressures on public services, may have restricted wage growth in some sectors, and is a source of widespread public concern.\n  * Is it time, therefore, to return economic and political sovereign power entirely to Westminster? The risks of doing so are extensive. For example, the UK would be excluded from the process of EU rule-writing, making it a less attractive location for foreign investment. The UK is unlikely to strike better trade deals alone than it has currently through the EU. And the UK would have no say in the design of more open EU markets for digital, financial and other services. Leaving would also have a destabilizing effect on the rest of the EU, which will remain Britain\u2019s largest market.\n  * In contrast, the main risks to the UK of remaining are political. High levels of immigration from the EU would persist. However, it is inconceivable that the EU will enlarge to include Turkey in the foreseeable future, and the UK and other EU states retain a veto over this decision.\n  * Nor need the UK fear the emergence of a more integrated eurozone, which will continue to feature profound differences in national outlook and is unlikely to enlarge quickly. EU decision-making overall is also becoming more intergovernmental rather than centralized.\n  * Continuing to pool its sovereign power selectively in the EU would enable the UK to help design integrated EU responses to many challenges that it cannot resolve on its own. These include the challenges of energy efficiency and sustainability; energy security; internet governance; and the fight against terrorism.",
              "* In a world that is more interdependent today than it was when the UK joined the European Economic Community in 1973, the notion of \u2018absolute\u2019 British sovereignty is illusory. It is also worthless if it limits the ability of future British governments to ensure the security and prosperity of their citizens. Judging from the UK\u2019s experience and its future prospects, the opportunities from remaining in the EU far outweigh the risks of doing so, and the risks of leaving far outweigh the opportunities."

              "Currently, the European Parliament is made up of 751 MEPs who are organised into eight political groups. These are not strictly parties, but rather coalitions between MEPs from different countries with similar ideological outlooks. A minimum of 25 members representing at least one quarter of member states are needed to form a group. Not all MEPs belong to a political group \u2013 these are known as non-attached members. Each MEP serves for a five-year term. The UK elects 73 of those.\nBoth the UK and the EU27 have recognised that delaying the UK\u2019s Brexit date will likely require the UK to hold European Parliament elections.\nThere are three main reasons for this:\n1) EU members states are legally required to hold European Parliament elections. The European Commission could choose to initiate treaty infringement proceedings against the UK for denying UK or EU citizens in the UK the right to vote, or indeed stand, in European Parliament elections. Any attempt to install MEPs without elections could also be subject to challenge in the EU courts.\n2) If the UK decided to remain a member state past July but had not taken part in the EU elections, then the new European Parliament \u2013 without British seats \u2013 would not be able to carry out its activities.\n3) Excluding the UK would require treaty reform, which the EU would find hard to agree at very short notice, not least given the need for ratification by member states.\nHowever, if the UK has ratified the Withdrawal Agreement \u2013 which requires parliamentary approval \u2013 by 22 May, the UK will not need to take part in the elections. If Parliament does not approve a deal by this time and the UK does not hold European Parliament elections, it will have to leave the EU without a deal on 1 June.",
              "In June 2018, the EU decided it would reduce the overall number of seats in the European Parliament after Brexit to 705 (down from 751) and reallocate 27 of the 73 UK seats to other EU countries. The plan was for this distribution to be effective from the next European Parliament. If the UK were to take part, the EU would need to halt this reconfiguration.\nVoting across other member states will take place between 23\u201326 May. Results cannot be announced before 11:00pm Brussels time on 26 May to ensure the results in one country do not prejudice votes in another. New MEPs will take up their seats on 2 July.\nThe EU needs to know by mid-April whether to halt the reconfiguration of seats. On the UK side, the Government has already laid the necessary legislation allowing the UK to take part in the 2019 European Parliament elections on 23 May.\nThe deadline for registered parties submitting the candidates they want to contest the election to the Electoral Commission is 25 April. Individual parties have their own deadlines for candidates applying to run.\nThe UK is divided into 12 regions: nine in England, and one each for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Each region has a set number of MEPs, who are elected through proportional representation \u2013 although the method differs between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In England, Scotland and Wales, MEPs are elected using the [D\u2019Hondt system within each region](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27187434). Parties draw up regional lists of candidates which they share with the electorate. The party that wins the most votes can send the candidate at the top of its list to Brussels. The winning party\u2019s vote total is then halved, and the party with the highest tally in the second re-ordered list can send an MEP to Brussels. The process repeats itself until all candidates for the region are appointed.",
              "The 73 British MEPs would cease to be members once the UK has left the EU. It is unclear whether plans for a post-Brexit reconfiguration of the European Parliament would then come into effect before the 2024 European Parliament elections.\nPotentially. In 2014, the EU introduced the (lead candidate) process to select the new President of the EU Commission. This meant that rather than simply emerging from discussion in the Council, EU leaders proposed the lead candidate of the biggest parliamentary grouping as the new president of the Commission. Jean-Claude Juncker was nominated under this process as the lead candidate of the European People\u2019s Party.\nMost parliamentary groupings have already selected their candidates this time: these include German MEP Manfred Weber for the European People\u2019s Party and Frans Timmermans, the Dutch Vice President of the Commission, for the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. No UK MEP would boost the numbers of the European People's Party since the Conservatives left the grouping in 2009, but Labour MEPs would increase the numbers in the Socialists and Democrats. It is possible that this could make a difference to the numbers \u2013 but it is also possible that EU leaders could decide to nominate a candidate from another parliamentary grouping or someone other than a designated \nWhat tariffs has Donald Trump announced \u2013 and what do they mean for the UK? \nEconomic and fiscal forecasts are a critical part of the government budget process.

              "## How do the elections work?\nGreat Britain uses a list system and divides the country into 12 electoral regions, with voters casting a single vote for their preferred party. Northern Ireland uses the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system for its three MEPs, where voters can choose their second and third preferences.\nPolitical parties produce lists of candidates for each region and order the candidates according to who is their first nomination. The \u2018closed list system\u2019 used in the UK means that voters simply cast one vote for the party that they wish to support, and the parties decide in what order their candidates are listed.\nAs parties win seats, those at the top of the lists gain them first. The number of seats each party receives is calculated using the d\u2019Hondt method of proportional representation. The party with the most votes wins the first seat available.\nHowever, once a party has been given a seat, its votes are halved (i.e. divided by the number of seats it has, plus one) and whoever has the most votes after that gets the next seat. If the winning party gets substantially more votes than any other, it could also win the second seat. If that were the case, its total votes would then be divided by the number of seats it has plus one (three in total), and the process continues until all of the seats up for election are distributed.\nDo elections work the same way everywhere in the EU?\nNo. Although the electoral systems used must all be proportional, member states can use different proportional systems. The \u2018closed list system\u2019 used in the UK means that voters simply cast one vote for the party that they wish to support, and the parties decide in what order their candidates are listed. However, a majority of EU countries use a \u2018preferential list system\u2019, allowing voters to cast ballots for both parties and individual candidates. Ireland and Malta use the same \u2018single transferable vote system\u2019 which is used in Northern Ireland.",
              "In most member states (eg. Spain), MEPs are elected to a single, nation-wide constituency. In others, such as the UK, MEPs represent constituencies (one of 12 regions). Minimum age requirements, electoral thresholds, compulsory voting, requirements to stand for election, and the particular date and time of the elections differ across the EU.\nThe European Council has set out how the UK\u2019s seats will be redistributed to other member states should it leave the EU. Of the 73, only 27 will be reallocated, reducing the European Parliament to 705 MEPs in total.\nThe fact Brexit hasn\u2019t happened complicates the elections for those states earmarked to receive extra MEPs. Ireland, for instance, currently elects 11 MEPs, but when the UK leaves it will gain a further two seats. If the UK takes part this time but leaves during the parliament, Ireland and others will have to fill these seats. As a result, Ireland is electing \u2018reserve\u2019 candidates at this election who will take up the extra seats when and if the UK leaves.\nHow are parties organised in the European Parliament?\nUnlike the UK, MEPs sit in cross-national groups that their national parties are affiliated with, largely based around shared political ideologies. For instance, the Conservatives sit with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group and Labour sit with the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) group. These groups tend to vote in blocs in much the same way as political parties do in Westminster.\nAlthough most groups persist from one parliament to the next, new groupings tend to be formed in each five-year term. A group must have at least 25 MEPs from at least seven member states. There were eight political groups in the 2014-19 parliament running across the full spectrum from far-left to far-right. No single group is even close to a majority of seats in the Parliament, so coalition-building is part and parcel of how the Parliament works.\n## Subscribe to the UKICE newsletter"

              "This week\u2019s European Parliament election (22\u201325 May) has several unprecedented features. Most importantly, the main pan-European parties are fielding lead candidates for European Commission President. Turning the election into a presidential horse race was intended to increase electoral participation and enhance the Parliament\u2019s democratic legitimacy, even though it remains to be seen whether voters will actually see things this way.\nCritics often blame European citizens\u2019 relative lack of interest in the European Parliament on its inherent inequality of representation. Voters in smaller member states are overrepresented. Germany\u2019s Federal Constitutional Court, when ruling on the Lisbon Treaty on 30 June 2009, said that the European Parliamentary election process \u2018does not take due account of equality\u2019. In the Court\u2019s view, this constitutes one of two key factors in the European Union\u2019s \u2018structural democratic deficit\u2019, the other being the European Parliament\u2019s \u2018position in the European competence structure\u2019, i.e. its lack of power compared to other EU institutions.\nHow unequal is the representation comparatively? \nIn the Treaty on European Union, government representation in the lower house is based on both a principle of disproportionate electoral weight given to smaller countries, and on binding thresholds of minimum and maximum representation. As a consequence, the European Parliament is at the low end in terms of electoral equality.\n  * One way to measure voter inequality is to look at the \u2018voting Gini coefficient\u2019.\n  * This uses the familiar measure of inequality of income, but applies it to European Parliament voting power per voter.",
              "Figure 1 shows the Gini coefficients for the European Parliament (EP) and that of several other parliaments. Voting power in the EP is outside the norm of individual European countries in terms of equality of representation. Germany, whose professed commitment to this principle is unparalleled among countries reviewed, is at the other end of the spectrum. Indeed, the European Parliament is at the low end in terms of electoral equality even beyond Europe.\n. Voting Gini coefficients\nHigher levels of inequality of representation may be expected in larger, more diverse polities where the political complexity of federal arrangements leads to awkward institutional compromises, which is definitely the case of the EU. In our sample, high voting Gini coefficients are indeed also observed for the lower houses in India and Brazil, which come closest to the EP on that measure. For example, in Brazil voters from Sao Paulo state are notoriously underrepresented. Yet the US and Indonesia, which are also large and diverse, both display comparatively low voting Gini coefficients.\nHow much change would produce an acceptable level of equality of representation? \nRead in a different light, Figure 1 suggests that the European Parliament would not need to go all the way to representative equality as high as the German Bundestag to join the norm of lower chambers in democratic polities. This is important, since a modified distribution of seats that reduced the voting Gini coefficient to something like 10% could be achieved without entirely renouncing the Treaty principle of \u2018degressive proportionality\u2019 as currently implemented by the European Council. It would, however, require lowering the minimum of six MEP seats per member state, and thus a modification of the Treaty on European Union.",
              "The EU Treaties stipulate that \u2018Representation of citizens should be degressively proportional, with a minimum threshold of six members [of the European Parliament] per Member State. No Member State shall be allocated more than ninety-six seats\u2019 (Article 14(2) of the Treaty on European Union). The ratio between the maximum and minimum (96/6) is 16 to 1, while the ratio between voting-age populations of the largest and smallest members (Germany and Luxembourg, respectively) is more than 172 to 1. However, no specific formula for representation is provided, and the exact composition is to be adopted by unanimous decision of the European Council. The latest apportionment decision was adopted in June 2013, in the run-up to the accession of Croatia as the EU\u2019s 28th member state.\nFor most countries reviewed, average voting-age population per government representative is based on the total population per relevant territorial subdivision (e.g. state or province), taken from each country\u2019s census bureau, and on the \u2018Voting-Age Population\u2019 (VAP) variable from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA)\u2019s database ()."

As the UK has already left the EU, an independent Scotland would need to apply to join under Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union after first completing its separation from the rest of the UK.

              "One of the most intense debates during the 2014 independence referendum was whether or not Scotland could maintain uninterrupted membership of the European Union if it became an independent country. The UK Government argued that the rest of the UK would be the \u2018continuing state\u2019 and would exclusively retain the rights and obligations of the UK\u2019s current membership. Consequently, Scotland would have to apply afresh to become an EU member after becoming independent. The Scottish Government, in contrast, took the view that as Scotland would already be fully compliant with the requirements of EU membership, there was every reason to believe the country would be able seamlessly to become an EU member in its own right.",
              "Of course, just two years after Scotland voted by 55% to 45% to remain inside the UK, the UK as a whole \u2013 though not Scotland itself \u2013 voted to Leave the EU. Eventually, after some years of political turmoil, the UK formally left the political institutions at the end of January 2020, while it exited the single market and customs union at the end of that year. As a result, the debate that was held in 2014 on the implications of independence for Scotland\u2019s membership of the EU has been overtaken by events. Perhaps, then, it was not entirely surprising that after it became clear that the UK was heading for a relatively \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit, in March 2017, just two and a half years after the original ballot, the then First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, called for a second independence referendum. That call has, of course, not been answered. But Brexit does mean that, unless there is a change in the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU, the choice with which Scotland\u2019s voters would be presented in a second independence referendum would not, as in 2014, simply be whether it should be inside or outside the UK, but, rather, whether it should be in the UK but outside the EU, or inside the EU but outside the UK. Doubtless, once again, part of the debate would be about whether and how easily an independent Scotland would be able to secure EU membership. However, now voters would be being asked whether it would be better for Scotland to seek EU membership rather than retain its current position in the UK.",
              "Moreover, this link between support for the EU and support for independence is underpinned by how people regard the consequences of the choice that Scotland now seems to face in its constitutional debate, that is, between being part of the UK but outside the EU and being part of the EU but outside the UK. On many issues voters are more likely to believe that being in the EU would be better for Scotland than they are to feel that being in the UK would be better \u2013 and these voters are highly likely to say they would vote Yes. However, while the balance of opinion may be more favourable to EU membership rather than being part of the UK, it is still the case that in most instances less than half believe that EU membership would be advantageous. Many are of the view that it would not make much difference and are also seemingly more inclined to stick with the status quo. Meanwhile, although Yes voters appear to have few qualms about signing up to freedom of movement, they are much less ready to embrace the euro, and more broadly the question of what currency an independent Scotland should use remains contentious.\nOf course, in practice little has happened in the debate about Scotland\u2019s constitutional status since the implementation of Brexit. The COVID-19 pandemic prevented any significant discussion of the issue, while more recently the SNP\u2019s political difficulties have left the party unable to make the political weather. As a result, voters have had little exposure to the issues that would arise in the choice between being in the UK and being part of the EU, and we cannot be sure what view they would form when they have heard more about the issues at stake. But what is now clearly the case is that it is a debate that will be crucial to how voters regard Scotland\u2019s constitutional future."

Rather than simply being a question of whether Scotland should be part of the UK, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, framed the choice facing the country as being \u201coutside the UK, but inside the EU\u201d, versus being \u201cinside the UK but outside the EU\u201d. \nIn short, any future referendum on independence would be as much about Brexit as it would be about Scotland\u2019s relationship with the rest of the UK.\nThis, perhaps, is not surprising. After all, in the EU referendum in June 2016, Scotland voted 62% to 38% to remain in the EU. that support for being part of the EU is even higher now. Meanwhile, from the SNP\u2019s point of view, the outcome of the Brexit referendum provided the clearest possible illustration of their claim that, as part of the UK, Scotland is at risk of having its \u201cdemocratic wishes\u201d overturned by the less progressive views of voters south of the border.",
              "The question of whether Scotland could rejoin the EU if it left the UK was much debated in 2014\u2019s independence referendum (the Yes side said it would, the No campaign that it would not). At that point there did not appear to be a strong link between voters\u2019 attitudes towards the EU and their attitudes towards independence. According to the , 49% of voters with a sceptical outlook towards the EU (that is, they either thought that the UK should leave the EU or that the EU\u2019s powers should be reduced) voted for independence. Only slightly fewer \u2013 44% \u2013 of those who thought the EU should remain at least as powerful as it was voted the same way.\nThis pattern was also reflected in how people in Scotland voted two years later in the EU referendum. According to the , the level of support for Remain among those who voted Yes (62%) two years earlier was much the same as among those who had backed No (60%). \nSince the early 1990s, the SNP\u2019s vision of independence has been one of Scotland in the EU. Yet there has always been an element of the party\u2019s support that wished to avoid both the constraints of EU membership, as well as the limitations created by being part of the UK.\n## What has changed since 2016\nAfter the Brexit referendum, some voters began to reassess their attitudes towards independence in light of the decision to leave the EU. As the SNP anticipated, some who had voted No in 2014 and Remain in 2016 switched to backing independence. But these were counterbalanced by some who had voted Yes in 2014 but Leave in 2016, switching in the opposite direction to support Scotland remaining in the UK."

But it\u2019s also raised the issue, again, of Scottish independence, not least because a very comfortable majority, 62 percent, within Scotland voted for the U.K. to remain within the European Union. So there is this sense, particularly among nationalists in Scotland and among those who lead Scotland\u2014the Scottish National Party is the dominant force now\u2014that Scotland has been taken out of the EU against its will, expressed in the referendum.\nSo we now see a much closer alignment between the independence project and the project of European integration. And we see that also not just among the political elite but among voters as well. So there is now much more\u2014a much closer alignment between those who voted remain in 2016 and those who would vote yes to independence now, so much more so than any other time in history. And you\u2019re absolutely right that developments in Northern Ireland and in Ireland, actually, with its relationship with the U.K., now that the U.K. is outside of the internal market, these things are being observed quite closely in Scotland. Because although Brexit has created the political opportunity for independence, and for another referendum so soon after the last one\u2014it\u2019s strengthened that political case, but it\u2019s made it much more complex. And it\u2019s made it more complex because of the border between Scotland and the rest of the U.K."

              "The success of the Brexit Leave campaign in June 2016 and the subsequent exit process culminating in the EU-UK trade deal, negotiated at the end of 2020, has further heightened the debate in both Scotland and Northern Ireland about their citizens\u2019 preferred territorial status. As of this writing, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement has not prevented business disruption between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK nor between the UK and EU. Considering first the Scottish case, there has been much political discussion about whether Brexit justifies Scotland pursuing another independence bid, and the current governing Scottish National Party (SNP) supports a second independence referendum after the failed 2014 effort. After the SNP\u2019s success in the December 2019 general election, its leader Nicola Sturgeon claimed that the electoral success indicated that the party had a \u201c\u2026 renewed, refreshed and strengthened mandate\u201d to pursue a second referendum (), as the SNP claims that many Scots prefer being in the EU to being in the UK outside of the EU. To date, conservative governments under both Theresa May and Boris Johnson have denied the possibility of a second Scottish independence referendum.\nMost evidence on the evolution of the Scottish independence movement, prior to and just after the failed 2014 referendum, shows that both Scottish identity and beliefs about economic prospects of an independent Scotland are correlated with support for independence (e.g. , , , ; , , ). discuss the increasing salience of independence as an issue promoted by the SNP and how independence became a key political cleavage in the last 10\u201315 years, and show that the 2014 independence referendum itself accelerated this re-alignment where support for the SNP became increasingly due to pro-independence views. Support for independence appears to have increased since the failed 2014 referendum (, ), but there are few studies exploring the role that Brexit plays in such preferences.",
              "On the particular connection between the Scottish independence and Brexit, the debate prior to the failed referendum of 2014 and since has been premised partially on the assumption that a Scottish exit would allow it to re-enter EU. There is suggestive but not recent evidence that Scottish independence support is conditioned by expectations of international recognition. [Muro, Vidal, and Vlaskamp (2020)](javascript:;) find using 2014 survey experimental evidence that the prospect of international recognition increases support for independence; find weaker evidence that the prospect of EU recognition increases independence support on average, but that key sub-groups of Scots are more responsive to the possibility of such recognition. As with the above evidence on the role of economic expectations in the wake of possible independence, though, the causal role of expectations of EU recognition remains unclear (as such beliefs may not be separate from territorial preferences). Related, some have argued that a subset of SNP voters supported Leave strategically in order to produce the conditions for a second independence referendum ([Greene, Spoon, and Williams 2018](javascript:;)). This latter evidence however finds it difficult to disentangle the relationship between current territorial preferences and SNP support, and finds that a very large majority of independence supporters from 2014 also supported Remain; further, prior to Brexit, SNP leadership had strongly supported Remain. This set of findings provides suggestive support of the basic logic of territorial preferences being affected by negative shocks to the existing \u201cunion,\u201d but these previous data either come from prior to the Scottish referendum and Brexit (and the corresponding political fallout), or do not focus on Brexit scenarios. We draw on this evidence to argue that the role of Brexit scenarios should affect territorial views in Scotland."

              "# Scotland, independence, Brexit and the border\nThere is no doubt that Brexit has reenergised the campaign for independence in Scotland. The fact that Scotland had to leave the EU with the rest of the UK, despite 62% of Scots voting Remain in the Brexit referendum, created a grievance and a sense that Scotland\u2019s voice was being ignored.\nThe Brexit process has contributed to these feelings too. The Scottish government, along with the other devolved administrations, struggled to have any influence over Brexit negotiations. In preparing for Brexit, the UK government passed a series of laws that threaten to undermine the Scottish Parliament\u2019s law-making power. The [United Kingdom Internal Market Act](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4018581) is the most notable of these.\nAdding insult to injury, this Act was passed despite the Scottish Parliament (along with the Welsh Senedd) withholding its consent, against an established constitutional convention \u2013 known as the \u2013 which specifies that the UK Parliament will not normally pass laws in devolved areas without the consent of the devolved legislatures.\nThe Scottish government, led by the Scottish National Party, is committed to holding an independence referendum before the end of 2023. Rejoining the European Union will be central to its independence ambitions. But Brexit brings new challenges to the prospect of \u2018independence in Europe\u2019, and chief amongst these is the status of the border Scotland shares with England.\nFollowing Scottish independence, this would become an international border between Scotland and the UK; and if Scotland rejoined the EU, it would also become a new border between the EU and the UK. As an EU member state, Scotland would have obligations to manage and protect this EU border."

              "The EU is an important trade partner for the UK: in 2024, UK exports of goods and services to the EU were \u00a3358 billion (41% of all UK exports). Imports from the EU were \u00a3454 billion (51% of the UK total).\n## Trade affected by Brexit and other factors\nThe UK\u2019s trading relationship with the EU changed fundamentally after Brexit. The UK is now outside the EU single market and customs union. While there are no tariffs on trade in goods with the EU, subject to certain conditions, other barriers to trade are now higher. Brexit has also led to changes in the way data on trade in goods with the EU is collected. There is a structural break in the data from January 2021.\nIt is important to remember, however, that other factors, such as the covid-19 pandemic, the Ukraine conflict and disruption to global supply chains, have affected UK trade with the EU and other countries.\n## Little growth in goods exports\nThe UK\u2019s recent trade performance in services has been much better than that for goods. UK goods exports to the EU fell sharply in January 2021 after the end of the Brexit transition period, before recovering strongly in February 2021. Goods exports to the EU remain below their pre-pandemic/Brexit level, however: in 2024, goods exports to the EU were 18% below their 2019 level in real terms. It is important to point out, however, that goods exports to the EU were growing slowly before Brexit and the pandemic. In addition, exports to non-EU countries in 2024 were also 14% below their 2019 level in real terms.\nUK exports of services to both EU and non-EU countries fell in 2020 but have grown strongly since then. In 2024, UK exports of services to the EU were 19% above their 2019 level in real terms. Exports to non-EU countries were 23% above their 2019 level.\n## EU share of UK trade"

              "#  How has Brexit changed EU\u2013UK trade flows?\nAuthor links open overlay panel, \nThis paper estimates how  has affected goods trade between the United Kingdom and . Using product-level trade flows between the EU and all other countries in the world as a comparison group, we find a sharp decline in trade from the UK to the EU and significant but smaller reductions in trade from the EU to the UK. However, when we estimate the size of the impact on trade using UK data and UK global trade as a benchmark, we find strikingly different results. We identify two key sources of this discrepancy. First, the UK\u2019s global exports grew relatively slowly. We argue these are not suitable as a no-Brexit counterfactual. Second, Brexit also led to breaks in the measurement of trade flows, particularly for the EU imports data. To resolve these issues, we combine UK-reported data for its trade with EU and EU data for its trade with the rest of the world to use as the appropriate benchmark for comparison. This generates an estimate that Brexit reduced trade by close to 20% in both directions.\nFollowing the decision to leave the European Union (EU) taken by a referendum in the United Kingdom (UK) in June 2016, a process of extensive negotiations on the withdrawal arrangements and future trading relationship began. These continued up until days before the agreed (and several times rescheduled) exit of the UK from the EU\u2019s Single Market and Customs Union on 31st December 2020. In the intervening years, many potential scenarios on the degree of continued trade links were considered and a wide literature on the potential impacts of Brexit emerged. These covered the impacts on the UK, the EU as a whole, individual member states and specific sectors. The immediate impact of the uncertainty induced by the referendum on economic outcomes led to negative impacts on investment and exports during the period before the UK official exit from the EU.",
              "The second reason for divergence in the estimated effects of Brexit is the difference in data sources. The exit of the UK from the EU Single Market resulted in data collection changes, which caused a noticeable discrepancy in values that EU and UK statistical agencies report for the same trade flow. We find that collection methods for bilateral EU\u2013UK trade changed less in the UK-reported data than in the EU-reported data. Therefore, we suggest the most accurate estimation of the impact of Brexit can be found by combining EU data for its trade with the rest of the world (to obtain the comparison group) with UK data as the source for bilateral UK\u2013EU trade. Using this \u2018hybrid\u2019 dataset, we find that Brexit has substantially reduced trade in both directions relative to the no-Brexit benchmark. In our baseline model, UK to EU trade declined by 16% and trade from EU to UK by 24%. We further examine the variation across member states, product types, time horizons and role of extensive and intensive margin.\nThe paper is organised as follows: Section 2 gives a descriptive overview of the evolution of UK trade with the EU and rest of the world before and Brexit. Section 3 goes into detail on data and measurement issues. Section 4 describes the methodology and presents the initial estimations from the separate EU-reported and UK-reported data. It then discusses the key reasons why they give different results. In Section 5 we show our baseline estimates of the impacts of Brexit on trade between the UK and the EU using the hybrid dataset. We examine the effects on aggregate EU trade and on member states and discuss some robustness checks. Section 6 examines how the results vary across sectors, time and also by intensive and extensive margins of trade. Section 7 concludes.\n## Descriptive evidence on the evolution of UK\u2013EU and UK-RoW trade",
              "In this section, we set the scene for our analysis by presenting some descriptive patterns of trade both bilaterally between the EU and UK before and after Brexit and also how the trade of both economies with the rest of the world grew in the same period. Two aspects of this are particularly important. The first is the percentage of total trade accounted for by each economy in the other\u2019s aggregate international trade, which will influence the overall economic importance of any shock to\nThis section describes the EU and UK trade data and discusses some changes in methodology that occurred at the same time as the UK exit from the EU.\nThe baseline specification is to estimate the following: where represents trade flows into and out of (either the EU27 total or a specific member country), to each partner country of product in month . is a dummy equal to one for each month following the referendum (from July 2016 onwards), including 2021. is a dummy variable equal to one for each month following the exit of the UK from the EU (i.e. from\n## Estimates of Brexit using a hybrid dataset\nHaving established that both data differences and choice of comparison group contribute to the divergent results, how substantial is the effect on our estimated baseline coefficients?

In other words, we take the HMRC data as \u201ctruth\u201d and use those values for EU\u2013UK trade while having EU trade with the rest of the world as our comparison group.

              "Brexit introduced a major policy shift with respect to UK-EU trade relations and, by extension, non-EU relations. Given the importance of the EU market for UK goods and services, this shift was expected to impact UK economic performance in several areas. Portes () summarizes the evidence of this effect on three dimensions (trade, immigration, and investment). He concludes that UK trade has negatively suffered, consistent with predictions; that the impact on immigration has been much less negative than expected due to a sharp rise in immigration from outside the EU which has compensated, to some degree, the reduced immigration from the EU; and that the impact on investment has been somewhat more negative than expected. In addition to its impact on UK-EU trade, Brexit also affected trade between the UK and non-EU countries as agreements between the EU and third parties ceased to apply to the UK on exit. The effect of Brexit, though, is unlikely to be uniform both across sectors and across the many EU and non-EU countries that the UK trades with. For example, Portes and Springford () suggest that while there is some shortfall in migration for work, the impacts differ considerably between sectors. Bailey et al. () assert that the introduction of non-tariff barriers arising from Brexit has been particularly more challenging for smaller firms in the manufacturing supply chain.",
              "Brexit was a major change in the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU. Dhingra et al. () consider Brexit as the largest change in the UK\u2019s relationships globally in over half a century. It was inevitable that the exit process would be disruptive for several reasons. Firstly, disentangling decades of economic as well as institutional integration was bound to be challenging. In addition, it was not clear (until several years after the vote) what type of trade deal the UK and EU would be able to strike and implement post-Brexit. While trade rules would not change for several years after the vote, it was clear that Brexit would eventually introduce a new trade environment in the UK-EU relationship in the form of tariff and non-tariff barriers (or in the best-case scenario, non-tariff barriers only). Furthermore, the exit process was fraught with delays, ultimately culminating in the establishment of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) signed in December 2020. The TCA came into force in January 2021, reflecting the post-Brexit environment. Secondly, the UK was an economically important member of the EU. In 2016, the UK\u2019s contribution to the EU\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) stood at 16%, ranking second after Germany which contributed 21.1% to the EU\u2019s GDP, and just ahead of France which contributed 15% (Eurostat ). In 2015, a year before Brexit, 44% of UK exports of goods and services went to the EU, while 53% of UK imports came from the EU (ONS ). Since then, these ratios have gradually reduced. In 2022, about 42% of UK exports of goods and services went to the EU, and 48% of UK imports came from the EU (Ward and Webb ).",
              "Brexit is expected to have different impacts on UK trade with different countries. This heterogeneity across countries warrants analysis. With the UK out of the EU, a significant number of new trade negotiations will be at the bilateral level. Therefore, it is useful to understand the impact Brexit has had on UK trade with some of its key trading partners. This is a line of inquiry that is still faced with a paucity of literature. To help fill this gap, this study aims to assess the effect of Brexit on bilateral trade between the UK and EU member countries, as well as between the UK and key non-EU trading partners. Hence, unlike Kren and Lawless (), we enhance the bilateral effect analysis to also cover non-EU countries as well as EU countries with an extended dataset up to 2022Q3. The main question addressed in this study is how the change in the trade environment due to Brexit impacted UK trade with EU member countries and with major non-EU trading partners. While the Brexit vote happened in 2016, there was no change in trade rules until 2021. Therefore, technically, the underlying trade frictions had not changed in practice for most of the duration of this study. In any case, the focus of the current study is not to extract measures of trade frictions or border effects, but to show the differences in trade between pre-vote and post-vote regimes. By treating Brexit as a policy change, this study follows a long list of research that used this approach (use a variety of policy change dummies) to capture the effect of trade policy changes \u2013 for example, integration changes, such as monetary unions, or regional trade agreements (e.g., Dursun ; Micco, Stein, and Ordo\u00f1ez ; Brouwer, Paap, and Viaene ; among others). In this regard, we look at Brexit as a (dis)integration policy move"

              "In this paper, we assess the impact of the 2016 Brexit referendum itself and the introduction of the TCA on the geography of UK trade. Specifically, we examine the impact on trade between the United Kingdom and the 27 EU Member States with monthly data up to December 2021. We do so comparing UK\u2013EU trade to other trade flows as detailed in the methodological section. Estimation of the impacts of the TCA effect is made challenging by two concurring issues: the Covid-19 pandemic which disrupted economies and the sharp rise in shipping cost \u2013 which were also in large part a consequence of Covid-19. Similarly, the analysis of the effect of the referendum might be affected by other confounders. In order to isolate the impact of the referendum and of the TCA from other forces we apply a series of econometric techniques, which are difference-in-differences (DD), triple difference (DDD) and synthetic control (SC). In our principal regressions, we use total trade flows. It is possible that Covid may have had different impacts on different countries\u2019 trade; there may have been a differential impact on trade in Covid-related products which thus affects our aggregate regressions and/or Covid may have impacted differentially across sectors also affecting our aggregate regression. As discussed in Section 2 on the empirical strategy, we control and test for each of these possibilities.\nIt is important to note that in this paper we do not examine the impact on total UK trade to all destinations. Our focus is on UK trade with the EU. This is because, , if Brexit were to impact on trade, in the first instance we would expect this to impact on relative trade with the EU. Nevertheless, the aggregate trade effects are clearly of interest.",
              "As an EU Member State, the United Kingdom was part of the EU\u2019s Customs Union and part of the EU Single Market. The Single Market applies to countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Leaving the EU entailed a departure from each of these for the United Kingdom, but differentially for Great Britain and for Northern Ireland. Hence, Great Britain left both the Customs Union and the Single Market. In contrast, Northern Ireland remains in the EU\u2019s Single Market for goods, but not for services, and while not part of the Customs Union, remains part of the EU\u2019s common customs territory. The departure from the Customs Union and the Single Market has impacted the degree of market access between the United Kingdom and the EU (and the United Kingdom and third countries) in different ways. The changes in market access and the increase in firms\u2019 costs thus involve a combination of tariff barriers, administrative barriers and regulatory barriers.\nDeparture from the Customs Union means that the United Kingdom is free to set its own most favoured nation (MFN) tariffs on imported goods and is able to sign free trade agreements with third countries. The UK\u2019s MFN tariff was established in May 2020 and is commonly referred to as the UK Global Tariff (UKGT). To date, the United Kingdom has also managed to sign new free trade agreements with the EU (2021), Japan (2020), Australia (2022) and New Zealand (2022). The United Kingdom has also signed a series of \u2018continuity agreements\u2019 with those countries which have a free trade agreement with the EU, and consequently as did the United Kingdom when it was a member of the EU. The aim of the continuity agreements is to replicate as closely as possible the previous arrangements.",
              "The departure of the United Kingdom from the EU, as a process of trade policy \u2018disintegration\u2019 is a somewhat unprecedented policy change, which thus limits the existing relevant empirical literature. Regarding the possible impact on the United Kingdom, there is small literature on the impact of the Brexit referendum on the UK\u2013EU trade, mostly focusing on the effect of uncertainty. show that firms\u2019 entry into exporting to the EU was reduced in the first 6 months after the referendum as a consequence of an MFN tariff threat. use odds from the betting market to track the evolution of the Brexit referendum uncertainty over time, and show that the MFN threat started to affect the UK\u2013EU trade even before the referendum of June 2016. Looking at aggregate bilateral trade between the United Kingdom and 14 EU Member States, apply the SC method and find that the UK\u2013EU trade started to decline after the 2015 general election won by the Conservative party. look at the response of Portuguese exporters to the United Kingdom following the 2016 referendum. Comparing firm-level exports with the United Kingdom and other destinations, the authors find a decrease in export prices and volumes to the United Kingdom after the referendum, with heterogeneous effects along exporters and products. Work by using a large data set from a major UK retailer finds that following Brexit there was a switch of demand by UK consumers, with a 6% increase towards UK-produced goods, and a reduction of 13% away from EU goods."

              "Although the benefits of foreign direct investment (FDI) are well established in the economic literature, there remains a dearth of analysis of its impact within the European integration experience. Inward FDI is a major contributor to the diffusion of managerial best practices (Bloom et al 2012). It increases competition and shores up technological innovation (Alfaro et al 2004, Dhingra et al 2016). Also it should be more resilient than other international capital flows. Yet the literature estimating the FDI premium from EU membership remains scarce. European integration may have played a significant role and we need to get a good grasp of its effects.\nAnother reason to examine this issue is the comparison between the trade and the FDI impact of deep economic integration, of which the European integration experience is a textbook example. Focusing exclusively on trade, Glick and Rose (2016) find that earlier estimates of the effect of currency unions vanish when estimated using modern econometric techniques. Most of these techniques became standard after they published their original paper (Glick and Rose 2002). We ask whether the use of modern econometric techniques eliminates the effects of EU membership on FDI. We find that it does not, .\nFigure 1 shows FDI net inflows for the three largest economies in the EU. The UK is by far the largest recipient. Net FDI inflows were small until the mid-1990s but exhibit two periods of rapid expansion \u2013 one in the second half of the 1990s and the other between the dot-com bubble and the financial crisis. It is also worth noting that these flows are much more volatile than expected, which may reflect the increasing share of more \u2018footloose\u2019 service activities, especially finance.",
              "This column reports new estimates of the FDI premium from EU membership. We find that, between 1985 and 2013, EU membership increased FDI inflows by 28% (Bruno et al. 2016). This is a large, significant, and memorable effect \u2013 a percentage point for each of the 28 EU members. Our estimates for the FDI premium are robust and they range from 14% (Heckman) to 33% (OLS) to 38% (Poisson estimates). They survive the Glick-Rose critique and do so comfortably. However, and more importantly, they help advocate for FDI as a channel (in addition to trade) for delivering substantial payoffs from deep integration.\n. Foreign direct investment in France, Germany and the UK, 1970-2014 (net inflows, BoP, current US$)\n: World Bank World Development Indicators 2015.\nThe gravity model has been a staple of international economics. It explains bilateral cross-border flows (trade, migration, investment, etc) based on the relative size and distance between countries or regions (Baldwin and Taglioni 2011, Head and Mayer 2014). A country\u2019s economic size is expected to have a positive effect on bilateral flows while distance is expected to have a negative effect (distance is often taken to reflect a whole range of trade costs including language, bureaucracy, culture, etc). The last two decades have witnessed enormous progress in this area. Among many influential pieces, Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) and Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006) are the crucial ones for our purposes. This new structural gravity approach (Fally 2015) provides needed theoretical underpinnings as well as strong support for the econometric estimation of gravity models. \nIn Bruno et al. (2016), we estimate the impact of EU membership on FDI. We used the latest available data on bilateral FDI flows, GDP and GDP per capita (sender and target), bilateral distance and the shares of manufacturing output, exports and imports in total GDP.",
              "How does our 28% estimate compare with and relate to other estimates in the literature? Straathof et al. (2008) use a gravity model to examine bilateral FDI stocks. One of their specifications uses dyadic fixed effects, a somewhat different set of controls and earlier data (1981-2005). They find that EU membership yields a 28% increase in its inward FDI stocks from other EU countries and a 14% increase from non-EU countries (their Table 5.1, column 2). Bevan and Estrin (2004) focus on the new EU member states and show that even the announcement of start of EU membership negotiations has a positive and significant effect on FDI inflows. We can also look at the bilateral trade flows literature for a comparison, but we need to bear in mind that we focus on bilateral FDI in our model. Baier et al. (2008) find that trade is increased by about 130% after 10 to 15 years of EU membership, while the similar impact of EFTA membership is about 35%. We find instead that EU membership increases FDI inflows by about 28% in a country that is a member of the EU, which may be because trade is easier to adjust than FDI flows. This may help further our understanding of how benefits from deep integration actually take root (Campos et al. 2015).\nHow much additional FDI does a country receive as a consequence of being a member of the EU? This is obviously an important question for which, surprisingly, one still finds very few answers. We find EU membership robustly increases net FDI inflows. Our three main estimates range between 14% and 38% depending on the choice of econometric technique. The average of these is 28%. This is a large, robust, significant, substantial, and memorable benefit \u2013 a percentage point for each of the 28 members of the EU. Moreover, this result has enormous implications for the European integration project and for countries, like the UK, that are currently considering substantial changes to the terms of their relationship with the EU."

Modelling FDI is much more complicated than modelling some aspects of trade (tariffs and non-tariffs barriers). Investment is volatile, and to a great extent, its performance is more difficult to grasp than trade ([Fern\u00e1ndez-Pacheco Theurer et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999324001846#bib28)); however, the potential emergence of restrictions on cross-border investment due to Brexit suggests that the total cost of leaving the  (EU) is likely to be larger than previous estimations based only on trade. Therefore, this paper analyses the impact of Brexit, considering barriers to trade and the role of FDI. Our results suggest that including FDI considerably worsens the adverse effects of trade caused by Brexit.",

According to its 3 alternative scenarios, the UK would face a fall in FDI flows by 10% under the European Economic Area membership, between \u221215% and \u221220% under an FTA with the EU or a reduction between 18% and 26% in the \u2018no deal\u2019 case. These results have been used to model the overall macro-economic impact of leaving the EU. calculate that the FDI stock would decrease by 34%. Conversely, predict a 22% decrease in FDI inflows in the UK after leaving the EU.\nThe empirical studies analysing and FDI find a positive relationship. This result is typical in economic integration processes, in general, but seems to be even more pronounced in the case of EU integration, and it is also confirmed by studies focusing on Brexit. Most studies cited above focus on estimating the size of the reduction in FDI stock or flows but did not evaluate its resulting impact, which is the focus of our paper.\nThe few papers which estimate the impact of a reduction on FDI in the UK after Brexit include the analysis of Dhingra et al., 2017, , , , , and .\nDhingra et al., 2017 and evaluate the impact of FDI flow reductions in the UK. The former uses the average of the estimations of the impact of EU membership on FDI in the UK calculated by several authors (; ; ), while the latter use the estimations of .",
              "Several studies have assessed the impact of regional integration on the flows or stocks of FDI. Overall, they find that regional integration affects FDI entry positively. find evidence that a regional integration agreement (such as the EU membership) would increase the stock of FDI by around 27%.  estimates that a reduction of 20% in regulatory differences increases FDI inflows by 15% and suggests that belonging to the EU single market can have an additional positive impact on FDI flows beyond the effects of traditional agreements (FTAs). This postulation makes sense, given that the EU is the world's most integrated economic area (i.e. with the lowest regulatory barriers across different countries).\nFurther studies focus on the impact of the on FDI flows. For example,  examine the impact of EU membership on the Central and Eastern European economies. They find that key announcements around EU accession increased FDI inflow to the applicant countries. found that FDI to Spain expanded due to its EU accession and was crucial in promoting productivity growth. and found that the inward FDI in Spain and Portugal increased significantly after accessing the EU in 1986. Similar results were found for the UK, Ireland, Spain and Sweden (). also confirm the increase in FDI inflows for the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden. FDI inflows seem to rise when a country becomes part of the EU.  estimate the impact of a potential enlargement of the European (EMU) to the 10 countries that obtained EU membership in 2004. They estimate that the FDI inflow would rise by around 21%."

              "When it comes to letterbox firms, systemic risk would decline if UK firms moved more substance to the continent, and an EU-UK agreement could pave the way for improvements. It is not in UK supervisors\u2019 interest to allow cross-border fragility to pile up. A stronger and safer market will encourage growth, offsetting any initial shifts in business.\nSupervisors also need new ways to manage Brexit-related fragmentation of investment-firm oversight. Luxembourg harbours around \u20ac5.5 trillion in assets under management \u2013 more than the UK and almost double the size of what is held Germany or France. Yet many asset management firms in Luxembourg delegate portfolio management. There is a concern that these firms are mainly \u2018letterbox entities\u2019, with minimal presence in Luxembourg and real decision-making, risk management and other functions carried out in London. This could undermine proper oversight, as firms might have incentive to seek out low-regulation entry points into the EU while conducting real operations elsewhere. It does not help the UK to have its firms seeking out laxer rules for their cross-border business. A high-level agreement on common standards and manageable compliance burdens could help both sides.\nAs tensions recede, it is worth exploring how London could better serve as a hub for foreign direct investment into the EU. The UK is second overall, after the United States, representing 25 percent of all acquisitions and 21 percent of greenfield projects in the single market (European Commission, 2024). After Brexit, total FDI levels from the UK into the EU dropped by about one quarter, although the extent to which other jurisdictions may have stepped in is unclear, as some inflows originated from London-based non-UK firms. In any case, the UK can act as a single point of entry for many global firms into the EU, and the EU should welcome such investment."

              "The initial literature that examined the potential effect on FDI flows on a country's accession to a customs union essentially extended the well-understood concepts of \u2018trade creation\u2019 and \u2018trade diversion\u2019 to the issue of FDI. This then makes a series of predictions concerning both FDI flows into a country from outside the customs union, and also regarding intraunion FDI. Much of the analysis that seeks to link FDI decisions of firms to country level decisions regarding economic integration is based on the analysis of Rowthorn ().\nThese can be summarized as follows: firstly, that a country's membership of a customs union makes it more attractive for inward investment from outside the region (Collie, ), with a general increase in \u2018interbloc\u2019 FDI (Donnenfeld, ). This is in turn related to the \u2018optimal tariff\u2019 literature; see for example Blonigen and Cole (), who applied the model of Blanchard () to the case of Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization. Theoretically, one could adopt a similar analysis to the case of Brexit, concluding that the UK may seek to attract \u2018tariff jumping\u2019 FDI at the expense of the EU. This is, however, not a position that those advocating Brexit have yet adopted, for fear that retaliation from the EU would cause a reduction in FDI to the UK from outside the EU. Bajo-Rubio and L\u00f3pez-Pueyo () for example argued that Spain became more attractive for non-EU inward investment as the EU moved towards the single market in 1992.",
              "Since the outcome on the UK's exit (\u2018Brexit\u2019) from the European Union (EU) referendum there has been much comment on the likely nature of the UK's trading relationship with the EU and the rest of the world. However, despite its importance to the UK economy, the effect on inward foreign direct investment (FDI) received little comment during the referendum debate, and only more recently have the positions of, for example, the Japanese car makers in the UK been the focus of attention. This is despite the fact that the UK has been for 40 years not merely open to inward investment but has actively sought foreign investment across all sectors. Many UK and non-UK firms have taken the opportunity to develop supply chains that cross into and out of the UK several times. The position of these firms, and the capacity for the UK to continue to attract inward FDI, is potentially one of the most important economic aspects of the UK's leaving the EU.\nIt is well known that the UK has a long running trade deficit, but what has received much less attention is the extent to which the adverse long-term effects of this have been offset by the quantity of inward FDI that the UK attracts. Hitherto, any analysis of the likely effect of Brexit in terms of firm location decisions has focused on seeking to explore the extent to which such decisions have historically been influenced by the UK's membership of the EU. A more targeted approach would be to explore the short and long-term dynamics of FDI into the UK, and to use them to infer the implications of Brexit. This is the approach that we propose. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to explore the likely effect on inward investment of Brexit, with a particular focus on distinguishing between the long-term drivers of inward investment into the UK, and the effect of short-term volatility.",
              "Even more interestingly, Brexit raises a more general issue that the literature on FDI has yet to address. In particular, there has been a plethora of papers focusing on the effect of joining a free-trade area or a customs union and especially the EU; still, we know surprisingly little about a reverse move, leaving a free-trade area or a customs union, since the noteworthy instances are too few to draw even speculative conclusions. (The Seychelles and Madagascar left the Southern African Development Community for a period, and membership of the Central European Free Trade Agreement when a country joins the EU. To the best of our knowledge these are the only examples of countries leaving a customs union.) The naive approach, which was sometimes offered by politicians in the run up to the referendum and indeed by some for the 12 months up to the 2017 UK general election but dismissed almost unanimously by policy makers, academics and the popular press, would be simply to assume that the effect on FDI would simply be zero, with new opportunities offsetting any detrimental effects. And yet, what may happen to (inward) FDI is more than an important concern; it is a centrepiece economic criterion to make a decision to remain or not in a free-trade area or a customs union. Given that the country that considers such a move is the UK, and that the union that it involves is the EU, having a framework to study how FDI could possibly react to such an event is as timely an issue as it can ever be."

The perspectives of stakeholders within the UK, in the EU, and internationally will be noted, drawing on the developments of both the pre-Brexit and post-Brexit periods.\n## Arguments in Favor of the UK Rejoining the EU\nAdvocates for the UK (\u201cRejoiners\u201d) argue that Brexit has been detrimental in numerous ways, and that renewed EU membership would yield significant benefits. Their case spans economic gains, political influence, social opportunities, diplomatic and security advantages, legal alignment , and broader strategic considerations. Proponents draw on evidence from the Brexit experience \u2013 pointing to losses incurred since 2020 \u2013 as well as the advantages the UK used to enjoy as an EU member. Below are the major pro-rejoin arguments in 2025:\n### Economic Benefits and Market Access",
              "Finally, at the level of global trade talks and standards, the EU\u2019s clout far exceeds the UK\u2019s alone. A rejoined UK would be part of one of the two biggest rule-making entities in the global economy (the EU and US). This means more with powers like China or the United States. For instance, if the EU sets data privacy standards (as it did with GDPR) or negotiates trade terms, the UK as a member would benefit from those, whereas outside it often ends up aligning with EU rules anyway (to access the market) but without any control. In summary, the political argument is that EU membership empowers British influence , both within Europe and globally, far more than the \u201csplendid isolation\u201d Brexit was supposed to grant. Britain may have \u201ctaken back control\u201d on paper, but in reality being outside has often meant over the European decisions that matter. Rejoining would remedy that.\n### Social, Cultural, and Mobility Advantages",
              "Socially, EU membership also implies being part of a broader European community. Many in the UK feel European and welcomed the cultural exchange that came with membership \u2013 from ease of tourism to town twinning to collaborative projects in arts and science. Rejoining would reaffirm common values and collaboration with neighbors. This has intangible benefits: for instance, it could reduce the sense of insularity and mend some of the societal polarization that Brexit induced. Free movement is not just about work \u2013 it facilitates cross-cultural understanding, familial ties (there are countless binational families who have struggled with the new residency rules), and the general openness of society. Proponents often mention that Britons were living in other EU countries pre-Brexit (in Spain, France, etc.), and a similar number of EU citizens were long-term residents of the UK. Brexit complicated their lives with new bureaucratic hurdles. Rejoining would resolve the status of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU at a stroke , by reinstating their automatic rights."

Within the next ten to 15 years, nearly one in five Leave voters (18 per cent) would either like the UK to re-join the EU or the single market and a further 45 per cent would like to see a closer relationship or see the UK in a new kind of association with the EU.\nIn considering what these findings mean for future government policy and the UK\u2019s post-Brexit relationship with the EU, we suggest that:\n  * There is a need for Britain\u2019s political leaders to openly acknowledge the immediate consequences of Brexit and set out a plan to fix them. A substantial majority of the public, including Leave voters, think that Brexit has had a negative impact on their lives \u2013 and there is no political prize for shying away from the conversation about the costs of Brexit to date.\n  * Little public support exists for deregulation away from high standards in the pursuit of future trade deals. The British public overwhelmingly supports high standards on the environment, labour and social rights and food safety, even at the cost of not striking major trade agreements, suggesting that any deregulation agenda that lowers current protections will have extraordinarily low levels of public support.\n  * The British public is more pragmatic on Europe than is often portrayed by politicians and the media. While the public does simply want to move on from debating Brexit, the data show that voters tend to evaluate the trade-offs inherent in different choices in a pragmatic way. The public deserves honesty and transparency from political leaders about what consequences future choices will entail.",

              "* Brexit is regarded as largely negative by a substantial majority of the public \u2013 including a far-from-negligible proportion of Leavers and 2019 Conservative voters.\n  * A large proportion of the British public is supportive of forging a closer relationship with the EU post-Brexit, especially on security matters and trade, but there is still reluctance from most of the public to go as far as re-joining the EU single market.\n  * The British public is pragmatic in the choices that they would make over crucial aspects of the future relationship, including maintaining high regulatory standards that the UK once inherited from the EU, accepting a limited role for the European Court of Justice in the future if it means keeping the country more secure, or choosing to voluntarily align to EU rules in those areas where it clearly leads to economic benefits for consumers."

              "Just as in the aforementioned examples, the issue of whether the United Kingdom should remain in the European Union (EU) became a hotbed issue that served to divide the British public into two distinct camps. The campaigns that led up to the referendum engaged a large number of previously politically uncommitted citizens, as evidenced by the high turnout (72%) compared to most recent UK elections, and the result provoked a vigorous debate about the manner of withdrawal, and even about whether a second \u201cpeople's vote\u201d should be carried out with the possibility of reversing the result. Often acrimonious debates in the UK Houses of Parliament led, eventually, to the United Kingdom's formal departure from the EU on January 31, 2020, but, at the time of writing, disagreements continue about the economic and social consequences of the departure, with polling indicating that UK public opinion continues to be highly polarized on the issue (Curtice, )."

              "Barely one-fifth of respondents across the four biggest EU members, from 19% in Italy and to 21% in Spain and 22% in Germany, felt the UK should be allowed to return to the bloc on those terms, with 58-62% saying it must be part of all main EU policy areas.\nThe pollster stress-tested western European attitudes by asking whether, if the UK was only willing to rejoin the EU on condition it could keep its old opt-outs, it should be allowed to. Some (33-36%) felt this would be acceptable, but more (41-52%) were opposed.\nIn the UK, while 54% of Britons supported rejoining the EU when asked the question in isolation, the figure fell to just 36% if rejoining meant giving up previous opt-outs. On those terms, 45% of Britons opposed renewed membership.\nThe survey found that remain voters and those who backed more pro-EU parties would still broadly back rejoining if this meant adopting the euro and being part of the Schengen area, albeit at much lower rates.\nAlmost 60% of remain voters said they would support rejoining the EU without the previous opt-outs, down about 25 percentage points from the non-specific question, as would 58% of Labour voters (-23 points) and 49% of Liberal Democrats (-31 points).\nThe percentage of Eurosceptic voters willing to rejoin without the previous special treatment more or less halved, falling from 21% to 10% among leave voters; 25% to 12% among Conservative voters, and 15% to 9% among Reform UK supporters.\nThe fifth continental European country polled, Denmark, proved an outlier. Respondents there were very keen (72%) for the UK to rejoin, and more enthusiastic than larger member states about it keeping its previous opt-outs (43%).\nDenmark, however, is one of only three EU member states to hold opt-outs in major EU policy areas. The survey also found that large majorities in all five continental countries (63-75%) would support an independent Scotland joining the EU."

              "This does not mean that a Europeanised UK is destined to rejoin the EU. It would more than likely take another critical juncture to break the path dependence of the TCA\u2019s hard Brexit. Further, while the UK has engaged with European multilateralism, a distance has remained with the EU. The war in Ukraine has reminded British policy makers that the UK has withdrawn from the EU but not from Europe. But that has meant a focus on relations with European states through NATO (as discussed by Cladi) and, at some remove, with the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (Grogan ). It has also entailed a lot of muddling through in building links, especially bilateral ones, so as to avoid any formal UK-EU institutional setup on foreign policy coordination. The 2021 reflected this tone, making only a passing mention of the EU. This is not a sign of the EU\u2019s lack of importance to the UK\u2019s international relations; it is, rather, a sign of how such documents are drafted with political sensitivities in mind with geopolitics placed second. The 2015 UK also said very little about the EU, despite it being published shortly after the election of a government with a commitment to put to the British people one of the biggest foreign policy choices since 1945. That the EU remains the UK\u2019s most important multilateral relationship means the potential exists for closer UK-EU relations, but many decision makers remain uneasy at accepting this."
