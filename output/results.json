  "writeup": "# Should the U.S. Federal Government Substantially Increase Social Services for Persons Living in Poverty?\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nA substantial increase in federal social services for persons living in poverty would yield strong economic, social, and fiscal benefits\u2014reducing poverty and inequality, strengthening the labor market, and promoting long-term national prosperity. Evidence across multiple programs demonstrates that expansion would enhance efficiency, equity, and resilience across the U.S. welfare framework[Child 1][Child 2].\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis report evaluates whether the U.S. federal government should substantially increase social services for persons living in poverty. The analysis concludes **yes**\u2014expansion is justified on economic, social, and equity grounds. Federal social service programs such as SNAP, Medicaid, and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) have demonstrated measurable benefits in reducing poverty and promoting upward mobility. A large body of evidence shows that every dollar invested generates fiscal multipliers exceeding $1.50, improves long-term outcomes in health and employment, and contributes to intergenerational well-being. \n\nAlthough short-term fiscal costs exist, the anticipated long-term savings through enhanced productivity, higher lifetime tax contributions, and reduced emergency spending make expansion both a moral and economic imperative. Policy modernization, standardization across states, and enhanced coordination of delivery systems would ensure efficient, targeted implementation[Child 1][Child 2][Child 3].\n\n---\n\n## I. Introduction\n\n\u201cSocial services\u201d refer to government-administered programs designed to mitigate poverty by improving access to food, housing, healthcare, income support, and essential utilities. In the U.S., more than 37 million people live below the federal poverty threshold, facing structural barriers that perpetuate generational inequality. The social service safety net serves as a stabilizing force in both economic upswings and downturns, providing critical support to households on the margins[Child 2][Child 4].\n\nDespite the breadth of existing programs, gross disparities persist. Many working-age adults and childless individuals fall through eligibility gaps, while benefit adequacy remains insufficient in several assistance categories. Evaluating the case for expansion requires considering both the limitations of current systems and the proven long-term returns of social investment[Child 1][Child 2].\n\n---\n\n## II. The Current Federal Framework of Social Services\n\n### A. Overview of Major Programs\n\nThe U.S. federal safety net comprises a coordinated yet fragmented network of income, nutrition, housing, and healthcare supports:\n\n- **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)** \u2013 The largest food assistance program, serving over 47 million people to reduce hunger and improve nutrition[Child 2][Child 4].\n- **Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)** \u2013 Supports maternal and child health through supplemental foods, nutritional counseling, and healthcare referrals[Child 4].\n- **Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)** \u2013 Offers time-limited cash benefits and employment services for struggling families[Child 2][Child 4].\n- **Supplemental Security Income (SSI)** \u2013 Provides monthly cash benefits for elderly and disabled low-income individuals, preventing extreme poverty[Child 4].\n- **Medicaid and CHIP** \u2013 Expand healthcare access for low-income families, elderly adults, and children, closing healthcare gaps[Child 2][Child 4].\n- **Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8)** \u2013 Assists 2.2 million households with rent, capping contributions at 30% of income[Child 4].\n- **Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)** \u2013 Provides grants for heating and cooling to ensure energy security[Child 4][Child 5].\n- **Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)** \u2013 Offers refundable credits to supplement low-income workers\u2019 wages and encourage labor force participation[Child 2][Child 5].\n- **National School Lunch Program** \u2013 Delivers nutritionally balanced meals to schoolchildren from low-income households[Child 2][Child 5].\n\n### B. Core Needs Addressed\nThese programs address key areas of vulnerability:\n- **Food insecurity** (SNAP, WIC, School Lunch)  \n- **Healthcare access** (Medicaid, CHIP)  \n- **Income stability** (TANF, SSI, EITC)  \n- **Housing affordability** (Section 8)  \n- **Energy security** (LIHEAP)  \nTogether they represent a multi-dimensional commitment to basic welfare needs across the life course[Child 5].\n\n### C. Current System Challenges\nDespite proven successes, deficiencies remain:  \n- **Insufficient Benefits:** TANF and SSI benefit levels often fail to meet basic living costs.  \n- **Fragmented Administration:** Complex eligibility and state-level variability hinder consistent access, especially in TANF.  \n- **Coverage Gaps:** Significant populations\u2014particularly working-age adults without children\u2014receive limited or no federal assistance.  \n\nThese structural barriers limit the system\u2019s capacity to eradicate poverty comprehensively[Child 2][Child 4][Child 5].\n\n---\n\n## III. Anticipated Impacts of Substantial Federal Expansion\n\n### A. Economic Effects\nEmpirical research shows expanding federal social services stimulates economic growth and stabilizes markets:\n- **Fiscal Multipliers:** SNAP and unemployment insurance yield multiples of $1.50\u2013$1.60 per dollar spent, generating robust demand and output[Child 3].  \n- **Labor Participation:** Childcare assistance, paid leave, and EITC expansions increase work participation\u2014raising employment among single mothers by up to 2.8 percentage points[Child 3].  \n- **Economic Stability:** Enhanced social spending cushions downturns, minimizing output loss and supporting consumer confidence.\n\n### B. Social and Distributional Outcomes\n- **Poverty Reduction:** Existing programs lifted 39 million people above the poverty line; expansions could reduce racial poverty gaps by half[Child 3].  \n- **Child and Health Outcomes:** Early access to healthcare and nutrition programs improves childhood development, literacy, and long-term health[Child 3].  \n- **Reduced Inequality:** Expansions promote racial and regional equity, particularly benefiting historically marginalized communities.\n\n### C. Long-Term Fiscal and Productivity Implications\nInvesting in social services is fiscally prudent:\n- Early-life beneficiaries of Medicaid and SNAP show higher graduation rates, lifetime earnings, and taxable income.  \n- These outcomes yield lower long-term spending on emergency healthcare and criminal justice, creating **positive fiscal returns**[Child 3].  \n- Over time, the net cost of expansion declines as improved population health and productivity boost the broader economy.\n\n---\n\n## IV. Interaction Between Current Systems and Expansion\n\n### A. Strengths to Leverage\nThe United States possesses a robust framework capable of scalable modernization:\n- **Efficient Distribution:** Programs like SNAP and Medicaid already have streamlined infrastructure and low administrative costs.  \n- **Validated Effectiveness:** EITC and SSI reliably deliver direct income gains and poverty reduction.  \nLeveraging these strengths allows expansions to build on proven foundations[Child 1][Child 2].\n\n### B. Weaknesses to Reform\n- **TANF Limitations:** Eligibility restrictions and state disparities reduce national equity[Child 1].  \n- **Administrative Complexity:** Fragmented agencies hinder smooth coordination; digital integration can improve efficiency.  \n- **Inconsistent Coverage:** Some adult populations remain underserved, requiring expanded eligibility thresholds.\n\n### C. Policy Synergies from Scaling\nIntegrating and scaling existing social service systems will:\n- Improve efficiency through coordinated delivery and data sharing.  \n- Standardize benefit adequacy and access across states.  \n- Enhance transparency and equity through centralized oversight.  \n\nCombined expansion and modernization can amplify efficiency while minimizing redundancy.\n\n---\n\n## V. Policy Evaluation and Recommendations\n\nEvidence supports **targeted yet substantial federal expansion**, emphasizing quality, accessibility, and fairness:\n- **Targeted Investment:** Scale cost-effective programs such as SNAP, Medicaid, and EITC with proven economic returns.  \n- **Modernization:** Digitize service delivery to reduce administrative costs and increase uptake.  \n- **Accountability Frameworks:** Implement cross-program evaluation tools to measure outcomes and ensure fiscal discipline.  \n- **Equity-Centered Design:** Increase support for marginalized populations, especially children and single-parent households.\n\nCollectively, these reforms ensure expansion translates into measurable, sustainable gains in human welfare and economic productivity.\n\n---\n\n## VI. Conclusion\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly indicates that **substantially increasing federal social services for persons living in poverty would deliver significant long-term benefits**. Expansion boosts economic output, raises labor participation, reduces poverty and inequality, and invests in the nation\u2019s human capital. The current system, while extensive, leaves too many behind; thus, fiscal and administrative strengthening is necessary.\n\nStrategically designed, evidence-based expansion will enhance both equity and efficiency\u2014ensuring programs like SNAP, Medicaid, and EITC not only alleviate hardship but also foster economic inclusion and national resilience[Child 1][Child 2][Child 3].  \n\n---\n\n## Appendices (Summary Data)\n\n- **Program Reach:** 80+ federal initiatives collectively serve tens of millions of individuals each year, addressing multi-dimensional poverty.  \n- **Economic Returns:** Fiscal multipliers of 1.5\u20131.6 per dollar spent affirm high economic payoff.  \n- **Social Impact:** Long-term gains in health, education, and workforce outcomes validate the return on public investment.  \n\n---\n\n**Final Policy Stance:**  \nIncreasing federal social services is both economically rational and socially just. Expansion should be substantial, targeted, and sustained\u2014advancing equity, opportunity, and shared prosperity across the United States.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Top government programs for low-income families - https://blog.healthsherpa.com/top-10-government-programs-for-low-income-families/\n[2] Poverty and Welfare | Cato Institute - https://www.cato.org/cato-handbook-policymakers/cato-handbook-policymakers-9th-edition-2022/poverty-welfare\n[3] Social programs in the United States - Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_programs_in_the_United_States\n[4] Programs that Use the Poverty Guidelines as a Part of Eligibility ... - https://www.hhs.gov/answers/hhs-administrative/what-programs-use-the-poverty-guidelines/index.html\n[5] Federal Low-Income Programs: Multiple Programs Target Diverse ... - https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-15-516\n[6] Various Supports for Low-Income Families Reduce Poverty and ... - https://www.cbpp.org/research/various-supports-for-low-income-families-reduce-poverty-and-have-long-term-positive\n[7] Factsheet: What the research says about the economics of income ... - https://equitablegrowth.org/factsheet-what-the-research-says-about-the-economics-of-income-support-programs/\n[8] Poverty - Healthy People 2030 | odphp.health.gov - https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health/literature-summaries/poverty\n[9] Economic Security Programs Reduce Overall Poverty, Racial and ... - https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/economic-security-programs-reduce-overall-poverty-racial-and-ethnic\n[10] The end of key U.S. public assistance measures pushed millions of ... - https://www.epi.org/blog/the-end-of-key-u-s-public-assistance-measures-pushed-millions-of-people-into-poverty-in-2022/\n",

        "# Top government programs for low-income families\nThe federal government manages safety net programs, also known as welfare programs, to aid low-income Americans and to protect families from poverty. These programs are essentially government subsidies that help offset the costs of everything from health insurance to food to education, so that families in need can save their resources to help further their own economic growth. \nOr, in simpler terms, there are a whole range of federal programs out there to help low-income people so that there basic needs are met. That way they can focus on their own security, growth, health, safety and development. The federal government provides the funding for welfare programs, while states administer them and provide additional funds.\nThere are savings on health insurance through the . There\u2019s access to affordable housing through rental assistance programs. There\u2019s access to low- and no-cost early childhood education through Head Start. There is food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). And fortunately, those aren\u2019t the only government assistance programs out there. From the Supplemental Social Security Program to the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), here\u2019s our guide to the top 10 government programs available to low-income families.\n## Who qualifies for low-income government programs?\nRecipients of these kind of government benefits must prove their income is below a set amount, which is some percentage of the  you to be a United States citizen or an eligible non-citizen. And many programs have state requirements based on family size and details about combined family income.",
        ", the Trump administration has called for the introduction of  to receive some of these welfare benefits. President Trump doubled down on this concept, tying them into the  he introduced. For now, the government agencies and departments that administer these programs are developing ways to introduce work requirements into many of these programs. \nAnd don\u2019t forget that welfare programs are not entitlement programs by definition. Entitlement programs, like Social Security and unemployment insurance, determine eligibility based on prior contributions from payroll taxes. Welfare programs, however, are based solely on a family\u2019s income level, and thus level of need. \nNow let\u2019s look at each of these government programs in more detail:\n### 1. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\nprovides eligible people with a benefits card, used like a debit card, to buy food at designated grocery stores and farmers markets. The SNAP program gives food vouchers to 47.6 million people or 23 million households. They receive $133 a month on average.\nIn addition to SNAP, there\u2019s a food stamp program for nursing mothers and young children called [The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).](https://www.healthsherpa.com/blog/wic-benefits-eligibility?utm_source=blog&utm_content=govbenefits) WIC provides food or vouchers, education, and referrals to help feed pregnant women and children up to age six. In 2017, 7.7 million people received WIC each month. \nFor school-aged children, there is the , which provides free or reduced-cost lunches to 30 million children. SNAP, WIC, and the Child Nutrition Program are all administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).",
        "helps low-income families, seniors, and people with disabilities get into affordable private or government-owned rental housing. The Housing Choice Voucher Program gives certificates to rent approved units. The subsidy allows recipients to pay no more than 30 percent of their income. It provides 1.2 million units of public housing and local agencies administer it to 2.2 million renters. This is the old Section 8 program. The Public Housing Agency also allows some families to use the voucher to purchase a modest home.\n[Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/programs/liheap) (LIHEAP), providing energy assistance and weatherization programs. It provides $3.4 billion in block grants to the states.\n### 6. Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI)\n[Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI)](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/ssi/) provides cash to low-income seniors and adults and kids with disabilities. It helps the  buy food, clothing, and shelter. On average, roughly 8.4 million people receive $536 per month. Of those, 7.3 million are blind or disabled.\n## Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\nAdministered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), TANF programs [provide cash for a limited time to low-income families working toward self-sufficiency](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/programs/tanf). TANF may also offer non-cash benefits such as child care or job training.\n[2.5 million recipients received income from TANF](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/resource/tanf-caseload-data-2017). Of these, 1.9 million were children. On average, a three-person family received $447 a month. Despite this help, they still live below the poverty line. Families who receive TANF must get a job within two years and can only receive this benefit for five years or less in some states. In addition, if they have another child and do not own more than $2,000 in total assets, they may not be eligible for more income."

        "Although the exact number fluctuates from year to year, the federal government funds more than 100 separate anti-poverty programs. Some 70 of them provide cash or in-kind benefits to individuals, while the remainder target specific groups or disadvantaged neighborhoods or communities.\nThere are eight different health care programs administered by five separate agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. Six cabinet departments and five independent agencies oversee 27 cash or general-assistance programs. Altogether, seven different cabinet agencies and six independent agencies administer at least one anti-poverty program. And those are just the programs specifically aimed at poverty. That doesn\u2019t include more universal social welfare programs or social insurance programs, such as unemployment insurance, Medicare, or Social Security.\nAltogether, the federal government spends more than $1.1 trillion a year on 134 welfare programs. State and local governments add about $744 billion more. Thus, government at all levels is spending roughly $1.8 trillion per year to fight poverty (Figure 1). Stretching back to 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson first declared a \u201cwar on poverty,\u201d anti-poverty spending has totaled more than $30 trillion."

        "Prior to the the United States had social programs that mostly centered around individual efforts, family efforts, church charities, business workers compensation, life insurance and sick leave programs along with some state tax supported social programs. The misery and poverty of the Great Depression threatened to overwhelm all these programs. The severe Depression of the 1930s made Federal action necessary, as neither the states and the local communities, businesses and industries, nor private charities had the financial resources to cope with the growing need among the American people. Beginning in 1932, the Federal Government first made loans, then grants, to states to pay for direct relief and work relief. After that, special Federal emergency relief like the and other public works programs were started. In 1935, President 's administration proposed to Congress federal social relief programs and a federally sponsored retirement program. Congress followed by the passage of the 37 page Social Security Act, signed into law August 14, 1935 and \"effective\" by 1939\u2014just as began.

        "Published: Jul 30, 2015. Publicly Released: Aug 31, 2015. \nMore than 80 federal programs (including 6 tax expenditures) provide aid to people with low incomes, based on GAO's survey of relevant federal agencies. Medicaid (the largest by far), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) comprised almost two-thirds of fiscal year 2013 federal obligations of $742 billion for these programs. Aid is most often targeted to groups of the low-income population, such as people with disabilities and workers with children. Survey responses showed that criteria used to determine eligibility vary greatly; most common were variants of the federal poverty guidelines, based on the Census Bureau's official poverty measure.\nIn 2013, 48.7 million people (15.5 percent), including many households with children, lived in poverty in the United States, based on Census's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). This measure takes into account certain expenses and federal and state government benefits not included in the official poverty measure. The SPM is not used to determine program eligibility; however, it does provide more information than the official measure on household resources available to meet living expenses. In 2013, the SPM poverty threshold ranged from $21,397 to $25,639 for a family of four, depending on housing situations. Based on six mutually exclusive household types GAO developed, individuals in a household headed by a person with a disability or a single parent had the highest rates of poverty using the SPM, while childless or married parent households had larger numbers of people in poverty using the SPM.",
        "In 2012, the most recent year of data available, GAO estimated that 106 million people, or one-third of the U.S. population, received benefits from at least one or more of eight selected federal low-income programs: Additional Child Tax Credit, EITC, SNAP, SSI, and four others. Almost two-thirds of the eight programs' recipients were in households with children, including many married families. More than 80 percent of recipients also lived in households with some earned income during the year. Without these programs' benefits, GAO estimated that 25 million of these recipients would have been below the SPM poverty threshold. Of the eight programs, EITC and SNAP moved the most people out of poverty, however, the majority of recipients of each of the programs were estimated to have incomes above the SPM threshold, after accounting for receipt of benefits.\nResearch suggests that assistance from selected means-tested low-income programs can encourage people's participation in the labor force, but have mixed effects on the number of hours they work. Changes in certain low-income programs through the years, including the EITC, have enhanced incentives for people to join the labor force, according to studies. While workers who receive means-tested benefits face benefit reductions as their earnings rise, research shows that various factors limit how much people change their work behavior in response. For example, people may not be aware of such changing interactions in a complex tax and benefit system or be able to control the number of hours they work, according to studies. Research also shows that enhancing work incentives can create difficult policy trade-offs, including raising program costs or failing to provide adequate assistance to those in need.\n##  Why GAO Did This Study",
        "The federal government provides assistance aimed at helping people with low-incomes who may earn too little to meet their basic needs, cannot support themselves through work, or who are disadvantaged in other ways. With fiscal pressures facing the federal government and the demands placed on aid programs, GAO was asked to examine federal low-income programs.\nThis report (1) describes federal programs (including tax expenditures) targeted to people with low incomes, (2) identifies the number and selected household characteristics of people in poverty, (3) identifies the number, poverty status, and household characteristics of selected programs' recipients, and (4) examines research on how selected programs may affect incentives to work. For a list of low-income programs that were $100 million in obligations or more in fiscal year 2013, GAO consulted with the Congressional Research Service; surveyed and interviewed officials at relevant federal agencies; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency guidance. GAO also conducted analyses on low-income individuals using Census data on the SPM and official poverty measure and microsimulation data from the Urban Institute that adjusts for under-reporting of benefit receipt in Census survey data. To examine labor force effects, GAO reviewed economic literature. Selected low-income programs were large in dollars and helped meet a range of basic needs.\nGAO is not making new recommendations in this report. GAO clarified portions in response to comments from one agency.\nFor more information, contact Kay Brown at (202) 512-7215 or ."

        "The EITC and SNAP are examples of \u201cmeans-tested\u201d programs, that is, programs that limit assistance to people with low or modest incomes. Other means-tested programs include Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for low-income seniors and people with disabilities; cash assistance programs funded by the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, and programs that provide non-cash benefits like housing assistance. In 2011, means-tested benefits lifted 19.7 million people above the poverty line, including 8.5 million children. (See Appendix Table 2 for state-by-state figures.) \nMedicaid and CHIP provided health insurance to 66 million Americans during 2010 \u2014 roughly 32 million children, 18 million parents, 10 million people with disabilities, and 6 million seniors. Medicaid and CHIP have greatly reduced the numbers of uninsured children and now provide coverage to most low-income children. \nTo be sure, some critics question the effects of safety net programs on individual behavior, such as work effort, and how that affects poverty. Several of the leading researchers in the field have conducted a comprehensive review of the available research and data on how safety net programs affect poverty, and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has published their results. They found that, after accounting for what the research finds to be modest overall behavioral effects, the safety net lowers the poverty rate by about 14 percentage points. In other words, _one of every seven Americans_ would be poor without the safety net but is above the poverty line because of it. That translates into more than 40 million people.\n## Safety Net Supports Working Families and Promotes Work \nOver the past three decades, policymakers changed the safety net substantially so that it now does to promote work and support low-income working families whose earnings aren\u2019t high enough to make ends meet \u2014 and to support low-income families that lack earnings.",

Extensive research indicates that these supports lift millions of Americans out of poverty, help \u201cmake work pay\u201d by supplementing low wages, and enable millions of Americans to receive health care who otherwise could not afford it. \nTo be sure, the United States still has a higher poverty rate than many other advanced countries, and many Americans reach adulthood without the tools they need to succeed in the workforce. Various programs and policies, especially in areas such as job training and education, could be reformed and strengthened. But the claim that advocates of shrinking government sometimes make that public efforts to reduce poverty and hardship have failed is belied by the evidence.\n  * Federal assistance lifts millions of people, including children, out of poverty and provides access to affordable health care. Public programs lifted 40 million people out of poverty in 2011, including almost 9 million children, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s Supplemental Poverty Measure, which counts non-cash benefits and taxes. While Social Security lifted the largest number of people overall out of poverty, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) lifted the largest number of children. Together, the EITC and Child Tax Credit (CTC) lifted 9.4 million people \u2014 including nearly 5 million children \u2014 out of poverty in 2011."

        "# Factsheet: What the research says about the economics of income support programs\nSufficient income is one of the most important components of a stable and healthy household budget. Income support programs help ensure that U.S. households have the income they need to cover the basic expenses of daily life. Some income support is delivered through direct cash transfers, including in programs such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability Income, and Unemployment Insurance, while others provide essential goods such as food or housing to families, thus freeing up existing household income to be used for other purposes.\nYet the COVID-19 crisis demonstrates that existing income support infrastructure in the United States is in providing relief to those who needed it. Pandemic-specific income supports delivered through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act and related programs blunted some of the worst pain of the coronavirus recession, but they for income support due to sustained underinvestment in these vital programs over the past half-century.\nWhile both common sense and a make clear that income support improves the economic well-being of the people who access it, it\u2019s important not to overlook the effects these programs also have on the U.S. economy as a whole. This factsheet discusses the economic impacts of income support programs, who they reach, how racism prevents them from serving their economic function, and what policymakers can do about it, starting with the upcoming 2022 budget reconciliation negotiations.\n### The immediate economic impact of income support programs",
        "* During recessions, income support ensures people are still able to purchase goods and services, which softens theof economic downturns on the U.S. economy. For every dollar spent on UI benefits during the Great Recession, there was an in economic activity, and for every dollar spent on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, there was an in economic activity. \n  * Most studies find that income support from state paid leave programs increases labor force participation among mothers. Under California\u2019s paid leave law, for example, new mothers are estimated to be more likely to be working a year after the birth of their child. \n  * Other income support programs for families with children also boost labor force participation among mothers. A research by Taryn Morrissey of American University finds that providing income support to cover 10 percent of a household\u2019s child care costs results in a 0.5 percent to 2.5 percent increase in mothers\u2019 employment. Likewise, of the 1986 Earned Income Tax Credit expansion finds that this expanded income support resulted in a 2.8 percentage point increase in the labor force participation rate of single women with children. \n  * Income supports facilitate job matching, benefitting workers who find higher-paying jobs and firms that hire workers with the right skills for the job. Recent research finds that when U.S. workers have the income they need to meet their basic needs, they can take the time to find the right job for them, rather than taking the first work opportunity that comes along. For each additional week that a worker receives Unemployment Insurance, for example, the that they will be re-employed at a job that requires a higher level of education than their previous job. (See Figure 1.)",
        "The upcoming budget reconciliation negotiations offer a promising opportunity to enact these and other reforms to U.S. social infrastructure, including income support programs. These actions would not only benefit those U.S. workers and their families who need help the most, but also bolster the overall U.S. economy as it continues to recover from the coronavirus recession. \nFor more information, see Equitable Growth\u2019s issue brief, \u201c[Weak income support infrastructure harms U.S. workers and their families and constrains economic growth](https://equitablegrowth.org/weak-income-support-infrastructure-harms-u-s-workers-and-their-families-and-constrains-economic-growth/).\u201d\nAlix Gould-Werth, \u201cThe only thing better than strengthening federal social supports now to prevent a coronavirus recession is strengthening them forever\u201d (Washington: Washington Center for Equitable Growth, 2020), available at .\nZachary Parolin and others, \u201cMonthly Poverty Rates in the United States during the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d (New York: Center on Poverty & Social Policy, 2020), available at ; Amanda Fischer and Alix Gould-Werth, \u201cBroken plumbing: How systems for delivering economic relief in response to the coronavirus recession failed the U.S. economy\u201d (Washington: Washington Center for Equitable Growth, 2020), available at ; Shawn Donnan and Reade Pickert, \u201cU.S. Unemployment Rescue Left at Least 9 Million Without Help,\u201d Bloomberg Businessweek, June 25, 2021, available at .\nArloc Sherman, Danilo Trisi, and Sharon Parrott. \u201cVarious Supports for Low-Income Families Reduce Poverty and Have Long-Term Positive Effects On Families and Children\u201d (Washington: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2021), available at .\nGabriel Chodorow-Reich and John Coglianese, \u201cUnemployment insurance and macroeconomic stabilization\u201d (Washington: The Brookings Institution, 2019), available at ."

        "Poverty is a multifaceted issue that will require multipronged approaches to address. Strategies that improve the economic mobility of families may help to alleviate the negative effects of poverty. For example, tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit alleviate financial burdens for families with lower and middle incomes by reducing the amount of taxes owed. In addition, federal social assistance programs are designed to provide safety net services and specifically benefit individuals and families with lower incomes. Two of the nation\u2019s largest social assistance programs are Medicaid, which provides health coverage, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food assistance. Medicaid and SNAP serve millions of people each year and have been associated with reductions in poverty along with overall health benefits. In order to reduce socioeconomic inequality, it may also be important to address factors that are associated with the health status of poor communities. Additional research and interventions are needed to address the effects of poverty on health outcomes and disparities. \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service. (n.d.) .

        "The better outcomes linked with stronger income assistance include healthier birth weights, lower maternal stress (measured by reduced stress hormone levels in the bloodstream), better childhood nutrition, higher reading and math test scores, higher high school graduation rates, less use of drugs and alcohol, and higher rates of college entry, the NAS committee noted.\nPolicymakers could substantially reduce poverty and racial inequities and advance opportunity for all children by adopting a range of policy proposals that the NAS panel evaluated, including expansion of housing vouchers and food assistance and making the Child Tax Credit larger and fully available to children in poor and low-income families, who now often get no credit or only a partial credit because their incomes are too low to qualify for the full credit based on its current design.\nMore recent analyses by Columbia University\u2019s Center on Poverty and Social Policy provide further evidence of how various policy proposals could substantially reduce child poverty and racial inequities. A child allowance like Canada\u2019s would reduce racial and ethnic poverty gaps by over half. A proposal to make housing vouchers available to all eligible families put forward by President Joe Biden during his campaign would reduce the white/Black poverty gap by up to a third and the white/Latino poverty gap by up to half. That proposal combined with two tax credit proposals endorsed by Vice President Kamala Harris would reduce racial and ethnic poverty gaps by even more.",
        "These kinds of policies will have stronger effects in a strong economy that provides ample employment opportunities to those seeking work. That requires robust stimulus policies during recessions and a continued commitment on the part of the Federal Reserve to pursuing full employment as an explicit and important policy goal. Moreover, we know that even when unemployment is low, some people face significant barriers to labor market success. Creating publicly subsidized employment programs that can help those struggling in the labor market \u2014 and expanding these efforts during periods of substantial slack in the labor market \u2014 can reduce employment disparities and expand economic opportunity.\n## 2017 Economy Bears Little Resemblance to Today\u2019s \nThe economy has changed significantly since 2017, the latest year of data in our poverty series that corrects for underreporting of key government benefits. In 2017 the overall poverty rate had been declining for three consecutive years. Likewise, poverty for the white, Black, and Latino subgroups had also declined from 2014 to 2017. Even so, the shares of Black and Latino people living in poverty, 20.9 and 20.1 percent, respectively, were still both more than double the share of white people living in poverty, 9.8 percent. In other words, Black and Latino people were more than twice as likely to experience poverty than white people in 2017.",
        "A long and continuing legacy of private-sector discrimination by employers, real estate companies, and others has also restricted opportunities for people of color in jobs, housing, and education. For example, a well-known experimental study found that resumes with stereotypically white-sounding names were 50 percent more likely to receive a callback than equivalent resumes with stereotypically Black-sounding names. And, beyond the discrimination associated with having a criminal record cited above, another experimental study found that Black and Latino individuals such a record were no more likely to receive a callback or job offer than similarly qualified white individuals a record.\n## Overall Poverty, Racial Inequities Would Be Much Higher if Not for Economic Security Programs \nEconomic security programs lifted 39 million people above the poverty line in 2017, including nearly 9 million children. Some 83 million people are below the poverty line when government assistance income and taxes are not considered, 44 million when they are. Government benefits and tax policies cut the poverty rate from 25.6 percent to 13.5 percent in 2017, and from 25.5 percent to 13.6 percent among children.\nEconomic security programs are particularly important in reducing racial disparities in child poverty. In 2017, government benefits and taxes reduced white child poverty by 7 percentage points, Black child poverty by 20 percentage points, and Latino child poverty by 16 percentage points, though poverty after accounting for government programs remains substantially higher among Black and Latino children than white children."

        "Figure B also demonstrates that rising prices played little-to-no role in the large increase in poverty. While high inflation curtailed many families\u2019 incomes in 2022, labor market gains completely offset inflation at the bottom of the income distribution, as through the bottom 30 percentile changed little between 2021 and 2022. Overall pre-tax poverty did not change last year, and poverty only increased using a broader measure of economic hardship that includes post-tax income.\nThere is also reason to think that the magnitude of the poverty increase was substantially larger than these figures suggest. Census models estimating the mechanical reduction in poverty due to the Child Tax Credit the size of payments received by families near poverty thresholds in 2021. As a result, poverty in 2021 may have been lower than we thought, raising the measured magnitude of the poverty increase in 2022.\nAlthough the strong labor market of 2023 will surely help to improve living standards and reduce poverty, it will nevertheless fall short of undoing the damage of letting key social assistance programs expire. Today\u2019s data indicating a sharp increase in 2022 reveal how much poverty the country tolerates is a policy choice.\nSign up for EPI's newsletter so you never miss our research and insights on ways to make the economy work better for everyone.\nGet new research, insightful graphics, and event invites from EPI sent to your inbox every week. \nPlease enter a valid email."

        "report": "- **Report: Should the U.S. Federal Government Substantially Increase Social Services for Persons Living in Poverty?**\n- ### I. Background: The Current Federal Social Service Framework\n- The United States government administers a broad network of social programs to alleviate poverty and support low-income populations. Core programs include:\n- **SNAP and WIC**, which target food insecurity and nutritional deficits among low-income families and children[Child 1].\n- **TANF** and **SSI**, which provide cash support and work-related services to families and individuals facing economic hardship[Child 1].\n- **Medicaid** and **CHIP**, which expand healthcare coverage for millions of low-income adults and children[Child 1].\n- **Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8)** and **LIHEAP**, which stabilize households through affordable housing and energy cost support[Child 1].\n- **EITC** and the **National School Lunch Program**, which supplement income and address child hunger[Child 1].\n- Collectively, these initiatives address fundamental needs\u2014income, nutrition, healthcare, housing, and energy\u2014and have prevented extreme destitution for millions[Child 1]. However, persistent gaps remain, including limited benefit adequacy, coverage shortfalls (e.g., TANF reaching fewer families over time), and bureaucratic fragmentation that reduces efficiency.\n- ### II. Anticipated Impacts of Substantial Federal Expansion\n- According to evidence on program effectiveness and multiplier effects, expanding social services could produce notable **positive economic, social, and fiscal outcomes**:\n- **Economic Gains:** Programs such as SNAP and unemployment insurance yield high fiscal multipliers ($1.50\u2013$1.60 per dollar spent) by increasing consumer spending and stabilizing demand during downturns[Child 2].\n- **Employment Effects:** Enhanced supports such as childcare subsidies and family leave improve labor force participation, particularly among low-income parents and single mothers, and foster better job matching[Child 2].\n- **Inequality and Poverty Reduction:** Expansions have historically lifted millions from poverty, and further scaling\u2014via universal housing vouchers or expanded credits\u2014could halve racial poverty gaps[Child 2].\n- **Long-Term Fiscal Dividends:** Early intervention programs (e.g., Medicaid, SNAP) yield higher future earnings, healthier adults, and reduced public spending needs, representing investments that pay off in tax revenues and lower social costs[Child 2].\n- Though the fiscal costs of expansion are considerable, these investments are offset by enhanced productivity and future savings from improved life outcomes.\n- ### III. Interaction Between Current System Strengths and Expansion Effects\n- Existing programs provide a robust foundation for targeted scaling:\n- **Health and Nutrition Infrastructure:** Medicaid, SNAP, and WIC already have proven administrative frameworks capable of supporting broader coverage with relatively low overhead[Child 1].\n- **Income Support Mechanisms:** EITC and SSI efficiently deliver cash and credit transfers but could be strengthened to fill persistent gaps in adult coverage and benefit adequacy[Child 1][Child 2].\n- **Systemic Weaknesses:** TANF\u2019s restrictive eligibility and variability across states undermine national equity; therefore, expansion should aim to standardize and modernize assistance delivery rather than simply raise spending[Child 1].\n- Strategically expanding these programs would likely enhance overall efficacy, leveraging program strengths while addressing inefficiencies such as unequal access and administrative complexity.\n- ### IV. Policy Evaluation and Conclusion\n- Empirical evidence supports the proposition that substantially expanding federal social services would produce **significant economic and social benefits**, including lower poverty rates, stronger labor markets, and more equitable well-being outcomes. While short-term fiscal costs are unavoidable, long-term gains\u2014higher productivity, greater workforce participation, and reduced reliance on emergency interventions\u2014suggest net societal benefits.\n- **Conclusion:**\n- The preponderance of evidence indicates that a substantial increase in federal social services for persons living in poverty would yield strong economic returns and lasting improvements in social equity. Policymaking should focus on evidence-based expansion\u2014scaling effective programs like SNAP, Medicaid, and EITC\u2014while integrating oversight and evaluation frameworks to ensure fiscal sustainability and equity[Child 1][Child 2].",

These programs are essentially government subsidies that help offset the costs of everything from health insurance to food to education, so that families in need can save their resources to help further their own economic growth. \nOr, in simpler terms, there are a whole range of federal programs out there to help low-income people so that there basic needs are met. That way they can focus on their own security, growth, health, safety and development.

President Trump doubled down on this concept, tying them into the  he introduced. For now, the government agencies and departments that administer these programs are developing ways to introduce work requirements into many of these programs. \nAnd don\u2019t forget that welfare programs are not entitlement programs by definition. Entitlement programs, like Social Security and unemployment insurance, determine eligibility based on prior contributions from payroll taxes. Welfare programs, however, are based solely on a family\u2019s income level, and thus level of need. \nNow let\u2019s look at each of these government programs in more detail:\n### 1. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\nprovides eligible people with a benefits card, used like a debit card, to buy food at designated grocery stores and farmers markets. The SNAP program gives food vouchers to 47.6 million people or 23 million households. They receive $133 a month on average.\nIn addition to SNAP, there\u2019s a food stamp program for nursing mothers and young children called [The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).](https://www.healthsherpa.com/blog/wic-benefits-eligibility?utm_source=blog&utm_content=govbenefits) WIC provides food or vouchers, education, and referrals to help feed pregnant women and children up to age six. In 2017, 7.7 million people received WIC each month. \nFor school-aged children, there is the , which provides free or reduced-cost lunches to 30 million children. SNAP, WIC, and the Child Nutrition Program are all administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).",

The Housing Choice Voucher Program gives certificates to rent approved units. The subsidy allows recipients to pay no more than 30 percent of their income. It provides 1.2 million units of public housing and local agencies administer it to 2.2 million renters. This is the old Section 8 program. The Public Housing Agency also allows some families to use the voucher to purchase a modest home.\n[Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/programs/liheap) (LIHEAP), providing energy assistance and weatherization programs. It provides $3.4 billion in block grants to the states.\n### 6.

It helps the  buy food, clothing, and shelter. On average, roughly 8.4 million people receive $536 per month. Of those, 7.3 million are blind or disabled.\n## Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\nAdministered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), TANF programs [provide cash for a limited time to low-income families working toward self-sufficiency](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/programs/tanf). TANF may also offer non-cash benefits such as child care or job training.\n[2.5 million recipients received income from TANF](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/resource/tanf-caseload-data-2017). Of these, 1.9 million were children. On average, a three-person family received $447 a month. Despite this help, they still live below the poverty line. Families who receive TANF must get a job within two years and can only receive this benefit for five years or less in some states.

Some 70 of them provide cash or in-kind benefits to individuals, while the remainder target specific groups or disadvantaged neighborhoods or communities.\nThere are eight different health care programs administered by five separate agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. Six cabinet departments and five independent agencies oversee 27 cash or general-assistance programs.

              "Prior to the the United States had social programs that mostly centered around individual efforts, family efforts, church charities, business workers compensation, life insurance and sick leave programs along with some state tax supported social programs. The misery and poverty of the Great Depression threatened to overwhelm all these programs. The severe Depression of the 1930s made Federal action necessary, as neither the states and the local communities, businesses and industries, nor private charities had the financial resources to cope with the growing need among the American people. Beginning in 1932, the Federal Government first made loans, then grants, to states to pay for direct relief and work relief. After that, special Federal emergency relief like the and other public works programs were started. In 1935, President 's administration proposed to Congress federal social relief programs and a federally sponsored retirement program. Congress followed by the passage of the 37 page Social Security Act, signed into law August 14, 1935 and \"effective\" by 1939\u2014just as began. This program was expanded several times over the years. \nEconomic historians led by Price Fishback have examined the impact of New Deal spending on improving health conditions in the 114 largest cities, 1929\u20131937. They estimated that every additional $153,000 in relief spending (in 1935 dollars, or $2.7 million in 2024 dollars) was associated with a reduction of one infant death, one suicide, and 2.4 deaths from infectious disease. \nFurther information: and \nVirtually all costs are paid by the federal government.

              "Published: Jul 30, 2015. Publicly Released: Aug 31, 2015. \nMore than 80 federal programs (including 6 tax expenditures) provide aid to people with low incomes, based on GAO's survey of relevant federal agencies. Medicaid (the largest by far), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) comprised almost two-thirds of fiscal year 2013 federal obligations of $742 billion for these programs. Aid is most often targeted to groups of the low-income population, such as people with disabilities and workers with children. Survey responses showed that criteria used to determine eligibility vary greatly; most common were variants of the federal poverty guidelines, based on the Census Bureau's official poverty measure.\nIn 2013, 48.7 million people (15.5 percent), including many households with children, lived in poverty in the United States, based on Census's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). This measure takes into account certain expenses and federal and state government benefits not included in the official poverty measure. The SPM is not used to determine program eligibility; however, it does provide more information than the official measure on household resources available to meet living expenses. In 2013, the SPM poverty threshold ranged from $21,397 to $25,639 for a family of four, depending on housing situations. Based on six mutually exclusive household types GAO developed, individuals in a household headed by a person with a disability or a single parent had the highest rates of poverty using the SPM, while childless or married parent households had larger numbers of people in poverty using the SPM.",
              "In 2012, the most recent year of data available, GAO estimated that 106 million people, or one-third of the U.S. population, received benefits from at least one or more of eight selected federal low-income programs: Additional Child Tax Credit, EITC, SNAP, SSI, and four others. Almost two-thirds of the eight programs' recipients were in households with children, including many married families. More than 80 percent of recipients also lived in households with some earned income during the year. Without these programs' benefits, GAO estimated that 25 million of these recipients would have been below the SPM poverty threshold. Of the eight programs, EITC and SNAP moved the most people out of poverty, however, the majority of recipients of each of the programs were estimated to have incomes above the SPM threshold, after accounting for receipt of benefits.\nResearch suggests that assistance from selected means-tested low-income programs can encourage people's participation in the labor force, but have mixed effects on the number of hours they work. Changes in certain low-income programs through the years, including the EITC, have enhanced incentives for people to join the labor force, according to studies. While workers who receive means-tested benefits face benefit reductions as their earnings rise, research shows that various factors limit how much people change their work behavior in response. For example, people may not be aware of such changing interactions in a complex tax and benefit system or be able to control the number of hours they work, according to studies. Research also shows that enhancing work incentives can create difficult policy trade-offs, including raising program costs or failing to provide adequate assistance to those in need.\n##  Why GAO Did This Study",
              "The federal government provides assistance aimed at helping people with low-incomes who may earn too little to meet their basic needs, cannot support themselves through work, or who are disadvantaged in other ways. With fiscal pressures facing the federal government and the demands placed on aid programs, GAO was asked to examine federal low-income programs.\nThis report (1) describes federal programs (including tax expenditures) targeted to people with low incomes, (2) identifies the number and selected household characteristics of people in poverty, (3) identifies the number, poverty status, and household characteristics of selected programs' recipients, and (4) examines research on how selected programs may affect incentives to work. For a list of low-income programs that were $100 million in obligations or more in fiscal year 2013, GAO consulted with the Congressional Research Service; surveyed and interviewed officials at relevant federal agencies; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency guidance. GAO also conducted analyses on low-income individuals using Census data on the SPM and official poverty measure and microsimulation data from the Urban Institute that adjusts for under-reporting of benefit receipt in Census survey data. To examine labor force effects, GAO reviewed economic literature. Selected low-income programs were large in dollars and helped meet a range of basic needs.\nGAO is not making new recommendations in this report. GAO clarified portions in response to comments from one agency.\nFor more information, contact Kay Brown at (202) 512-7215 or ."

              "The EITC and SNAP are examples of \u201cmeans-tested\u201d programs, that is, programs that limit assistance to people with low or modest incomes. Other means-tested programs include Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for low-income seniors and people with disabilities; cash assistance programs funded by the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, and programs that provide non-cash benefits like housing assistance. In 2011, means-tested benefits lifted 19.7 million people above the poverty line, including 8.5 million children. (See Appendix Table 2 for state-by-state figures.) \nMedicaid and CHIP provided health insurance to 66 million Americans during 2010 \u2014 roughly 32 million children, 18 million parents, 10 million people with disabilities, and 6 million seniors. Medicaid and CHIP have greatly reduced the numbers of uninsured children and now provide coverage to most low-income children. \nTo be sure, some critics question the effects of safety net programs on individual behavior, such as work effort, and how that affects poverty. Several of the leading researchers in the field have conducted a comprehensive review of the available research and data on how safety net programs affect poverty, and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has published their results. They found that, after accounting for what the research finds to be modest overall behavioral effects, the safety net lowers the poverty rate by about 14 percentage points. In other words, _one of every seven Americans_ would be poor without the safety net but is above the poverty line because of it. That translates into more than 40 million people.\n## Safety Net Supports Working Families and Promotes Work \nOver the past three decades, policymakers changed the safety net substantially so that it now does to promote work and support low-income working families whose earnings aren\u2019t high enough to make ends meet \u2014 and to support low-income families that lack earnings.",

Extensive research indicates that these supports lift millions of Americans out of poverty, help \u201cmake work pay\u201d by supplementing low wages, and enable millions of Americans to receive health care who otherwise could not afford it. \nTo be sure, the United States still has a higher poverty rate than many other advanced countries, and many Americans reach adulthood without the tools they need to succeed in the workforce. Various programs and policies, especially in areas such as job training and education, could be reformed and strengthened. But the claim that advocates of shrinking government sometimes make that public efforts to reduce poverty and hardship have failed is belied by the evidence.\n  * Federal assistance lifts millions of people, including children, out of poverty and provides access to affordable health care. Public programs lifted 40 million people out of poverty in 2011, including almost 9 million children, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s Supplemental Poverty Measure, which counts non-cash benefits and taxes. While Social Security lifted the largest number of people overall out of poverty, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) lifted the largest number of children. Together, the EITC and Child Tax Credit (CTC) lifted 9.4 million people \u2014 including nearly 5 million children \u2014 out of poverty in 2011."

              "# Factsheet: What the research says about the economics of income support programs\nSufficient income is one of the most important components of a stable and healthy household budget. Income support programs help ensure that U.S. households have the income they need to cover the basic expenses of daily life. Some income support is delivered through direct cash transfers, including in programs such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability Income, and Unemployment Insurance, while others provide essential goods such as food or housing to families, thus freeing up existing household income to be used for other purposes.\nYet the COVID-19 crisis demonstrates that existing income support infrastructure in the United States is in providing relief to those who needed it. Pandemic-specific income supports delivered through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act and related programs blunted some of the worst pain of the coronavirus recession, but they for income support due to sustained underinvestment in these vital programs over the past half-century.\nWhile both common sense and a make clear that income support improves the economic well-being of the people who access it, it\u2019s important not to overlook the effects these programs also have on the U.S. economy as a whole. This factsheet discusses the economic impacts of income support programs, who they reach, how racism prevents them from serving their economic function, and what policymakers can do about it, starting with the upcoming 2022 budget reconciliation negotiations.\n### The immediate economic impact of income support programs",
              "* During recessions, income support ensures people are still able to purchase goods and services, which softens theof economic downturns on the U.S. economy. For every dollar spent on UI benefits during the Great Recession, there was an in economic activity, and for every dollar spent on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, there was an in economic activity. \n  * Most studies find that income support from state paid leave programs increases labor force participation among mothers. Under California\u2019s paid leave law, for example, new mothers are estimated to be more likely to be working a year after the birth of their child. \n  * Other income support programs for families with children also boost labor force participation among mothers. A research by Taryn Morrissey of American University finds that providing income support to cover 10 percent of a household\u2019s child care costs results in a 0.5 percent to 2.5 percent increase in mothers\u2019 employment. Likewise, of the 1986 Earned Income Tax Credit expansion finds that this expanded income support resulted in a 2.8 percentage point increase in the labor force participation rate of single women with children. \n  * Income supports facilitate job matching, benefitting workers who find higher-paying jobs and firms that hire workers with the right skills for the job. Recent research finds that when U.S. workers have the income they need to meet their basic needs, they can take the time to find the right job for them, rather than taking the first work opportunity that comes along. For each additional week that a worker receives Unemployment Insurance, for example, the that they will be re-employed at a job that requires a higher level of education than their previous job. (See Figure 1.)",
              "The upcoming budget reconciliation negotiations offer a promising opportunity to enact these and other reforms to U.S. social infrastructure, including income support programs. These actions would not only benefit those U.S. workers and their families who need help the most, but also bolster the overall U.S. economy as it continues to recover from the coronavirus recession. \nFor more information, see Equitable Growth\u2019s issue brief, \u201c[Weak income support infrastructure harms U.S. workers and their families and constrains economic growth](https://equitablegrowth.org/weak-income-support-infrastructure-harms-u-s-workers-and-their-families-and-constrains-economic-growth/).\u201d\nAlix Gould-Werth, \u201cThe only thing better than strengthening federal social supports now to prevent a coronavirus recession is strengthening them forever\u201d (Washington: Washington Center for Equitable Growth, 2020), available at .\nZachary Parolin and others, \u201cMonthly Poverty Rates in the United States during the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d (New York: Center on Poverty & Social Policy, 2020), available at ; Amanda Fischer and Alix Gould-Werth, \u201cBroken plumbing: How systems for delivering economic relief in response to the coronavirus recession failed the U.S. economy\u201d (Washington: Washington Center for Equitable Growth, 2020), available at ; Shawn Donnan and Reade Pickert, \u201cU.S. Unemployment Rescue Left at Least 9 Million Without Help,\u201d Bloomberg Businessweek, June 25, 2021, available at .\nArloc Sherman, Danilo Trisi, and Sharon Parrott. \u201cVarious Supports for Low-Income Families Reduce Poverty and Have Long-Term Positive Effects On Families and Children\u201d (Washington: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2021), available at .\nGabriel Chodorow-Reich and John Coglianese, \u201cUnemployment insurance and macroeconomic stabilization\u201d (Washington: The Brookings Institution, 2019), available at ."

In addition, federal social assistance programs are designed to provide safety net services and specifically benefit individuals and families with lower incomes. Two of the nation\u2019s largest social assistance programs are Medicaid, which provides health coverage, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food assistance. Medicaid and SNAP serve millions of people each year and have been associated with reductions in poverty along with overall health benefits. In order to reduce socioeconomic inequality, it may also be important to address factors that are associated with the health status of poor communities. Additional research and interventions are needed to address the effects of poverty on health outcomes and disparities. \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service. (n.d.) .

              "The better outcomes linked with stronger income assistance include healthier birth weights, lower maternal stress (measured by reduced stress hormone levels in the bloodstream), better childhood nutrition, higher reading and math test scores, higher high school graduation rates, less use of drugs and alcohol, and higher rates of college entry, the NAS committee noted.\nPolicymakers could substantially reduce poverty and racial inequities and advance opportunity for all children by adopting a range of policy proposals that the NAS panel evaluated, including expansion of housing vouchers and food assistance and making the Child Tax Credit larger and fully available to children in poor and low-income families, who now often get no credit or only a partial credit because their incomes are too low to qualify for the full credit based on its current design.\nMore recent analyses by Columbia University\u2019s Center on Poverty and Social Policy provide further evidence of how various policy proposals could substantially reduce child poverty and racial inequities. A child allowance like Canada\u2019s would reduce racial and ethnic poverty gaps by over half. A proposal to make housing vouchers available to all eligible families put forward by President Joe Biden during his campaign would reduce the white/Black poverty gap by up to a third and the white/Latino poverty gap by up to half. That proposal combined with two tax credit proposals endorsed by Vice President Kamala Harris would reduce racial and ethnic poverty gaps by even more.",
              "These kinds of policies will have stronger effects in a strong economy that provides ample employment opportunities to those seeking work. That requires robust stimulus policies during recessions and a continued commitment on the part of the Federal Reserve to pursuing full employment as an explicit and important policy goal. Moreover, we know that even when unemployment is low, some people face significant barriers to labor market success. Creating publicly subsidized employment programs that can help those struggling in the labor market \u2014 and expanding these efforts during periods of substantial slack in the labor market \u2014 can reduce employment disparities and expand economic opportunity.\n## 2017 Economy Bears Little Resemblance to Today\u2019s \nThe economy has changed significantly since 2017, the latest year of data in our poverty series that corrects for underreporting of key government benefits. In 2017 the overall poverty rate had been declining for three consecutive years. Likewise, poverty for the white, Black, and Latino subgroups had also declined from 2014 to 2017. Even so, the shares of Black and Latino people living in poverty, 20.9 and 20.1 percent, respectively, were still both more than double the share of white people living in poverty, 9.8 percent. In other words, Black and Latino people were more than twice as likely to experience poverty than white people in 2017.",
              "A long and continuing legacy of private-sector discrimination by employers, real estate companies, and others has also restricted opportunities for people of color in jobs, housing, and education. For example, a well-known experimental study found that resumes with stereotypically white-sounding names were 50 percent more likely to receive a callback than equivalent resumes with stereotypically Black-sounding names. And, beyond the discrimination associated with having a criminal record cited above, another experimental study found that Black and Latino individuals such a record were no more likely to receive a callback or job offer than similarly qualified white individuals a record.\n## Overall Poverty, Racial Inequities Would Be Much Higher if Not for Economic Security Programs \nEconomic security programs lifted 39 million people above the poverty line in 2017, including nearly 9 million children. Some 83 million people are below the poverty line when government assistance income and taxes are not considered, 44 million when they are. Government benefits and tax policies cut the poverty rate from 25.6 percent to 13.5 percent in 2017, and from 25.5 percent to 13.6 percent among children.\nEconomic security programs are particularly important in reducing racial disparities in child poverty. In 2017, government benefits and taxes reduced white child poverty by 7 percentage points, Black child poverty by 20 percentage points, and Latino child poverty by 16 percentage points, though poverty after accounting for government programs remains substantially higher among Black and Latino children than white children."

              "Figure B also demonstrates that rising prices played little-to-no role in the large increase in poverty. While high inflation curtailed many families\u2019 incomes in 2022, labor market gains completely offset inflation at the bottom of the income distribution, as through the bottom 30 percentile changed little between 2021 and 2022. Overall pre-tax poverty did not change last year, and poverty only increased using a broader measure of economic hardship that includes post-tax income.\nThere is also reason to think that the magnitude of the poverty increase was substantially larger than these figures suggest. Census models estimating the mechanical reduction in poverty due to the Child Tax Credit the size of payments received by families near poverty thresholds in 2021. As a result, poverty in 2021 may have been lower than we thought, raising the measured magnitude of the poverty increase in 2022.\nAlthough the strong labor market of 2023 will surely help to improve living standards and reduce poverty, it will nevertheless fall short of undoing the damage of letting key social assistance programs expire. Today\u2019s data indicating a sharp increase in 2022 reveal how much poverty the country tolerates is a policy choice.\nSign up for EPI's newsletter so you never miss our research and insights on ways to make the economy work better for everyone.\nGet new research, insightful graphics, and event invites from EPI sent to your inbox every week. \nPlease enter a valid email."

          "answer": "- **Report: Should the U.S. Federal Government Substantially Increase Social Services for Persons Living in Poverty?**\n- ### I. Background: The Current Federal Social Service Framework\n- The United States government administers a broad network of social programs to alleviate poverty and support low-income populations. Core programs include:\n- **SNAP and WIC**, which target food insecurity and nutritional deficits among low-income families and children[Child 1].\n- **TANF** and **SSI**, which provide cash support and work-related services to families and individuals facing economic hardship[Child 1].\n- **Medicaid** and **CHIP**, which expand healthcare coverage for millions of low-income adults and children[Child 1].\n- **Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8)** and **LIHEAP**, which stabilize households through affordable housing and energy cost support[Child 1].\n- **EITC** and the **National School Lunch Program**, which supplement income and address child hunger[Child 1].\n- Collectively, these initiatives address fundamental needs\u2014income, nutrition, healthcare, housing, and energy\u2014and have prevented extreme destitution for millions[Child 1]. However, persistent gaps remain, including limited benefit adequacy, coverage shortfalls (e.g., TANF reaching fewer families over time), and bureaucratic fragmentation that reduces efficiency.\n- ### II. Anticipated Impacts of Substantial Federal Expansion\n- According to evidence on program effectiveness and multiplier effects, expanding social services could produce notable **positive economic, social, and fiscal outcomes**:\n- **Economic Gains:** Programs such as SNAP and unemployment insurance yield high fiscal multipliers ($1.50\u2013$1.60 per dollar spent) by increasing consumer spending and stabilizing demand during downturns[Child 2].\n- **Employment Effects:** Enhanced supports such as childcare subsidies and family leave improve labor force participation, particularly among low-income parents and single mothers, and foster better job matching[Child 2].\n- **Inequality and Poverty Reduction:** Expansions have historically lifted millions from poverty, and further scaling\u2014via universal housing vouchers or expanded credits\u2014could halve racial poverty gaps[Child 2].\n- **Long-Term Fiscal Dividends:** Early intervention programs (e.g., Medicaid, SNAP) yield higher future earnings, healthier adults, and reduced public spending needs, representing investments that pay off in tax revenues and lower social costs[Child 2].\n- Though the fiscal costs of expansion are considerable, these investments are offset by enhanced productivity and future savings from improved life outcomes.\n- ### III. Interaction Between Current System Strengths and Expansion Effects\n- Existing programs provide a robust foundation for targeted scaling:\n- **Health and Nutrition Infrastructure:** Medicaid, SNAP, and WIC already have proven administrative frameworks capable of supporting broader coverage with relatively low overhead[Child 1].\n- **Income Support Mechanisms:** EITC and SSI efficiently deliver cash and credit transfers but could be strengthened to fill persistent gaps in adult coverage and benefit adequacy[Child 1][Child 2].\n- **Systemic Weaknesses:** TANF\u2019s restrictive eligibility and variability across states undermine national equity; therefore, expansion should aim to standardize and modernize assistance delivery rather than simply raise spending[Child 1].\n- Strategically expanding these programs would likely enhance overall efficacy, leveraging program strengths while addressing inefficiencies such as unequal access and administrative complexity.\n- ### IV. Policy Evaluation and Conclusion\n- Empirical evidence supports the proposition that substantially expanding federal social services would produce **significant economic and social benefits**, including lower poverty rates, stronger labor markets, and more equitable well-being outcomes. While short-term fiscal costs are unavoidable, long-term gains\u2014higher productivity, greater workforce participation, and reduced reliance on emergency interventions\u2014suggest net societal benefits.\n- **Conclusion:**\n- The preponderance of evidence indicates that a substantial increase in federal social services for persons living in poverty would yield strong economic returns and lasting improvements in social equity. Policymaking should focus on evidence-based expansion\u2014scaling effective programs like SNAP, Medicaid, and EITC\u2014while integrating oversight and evaluation frameworks to ensure fiscal sustainability and equity[Child 1][Child 2]."

              "# Top government programs for low-income families\nThe federal government manages safety net programs, also known as welfare programs, to aid low-income Americans and to protect families from poverty. These programs are essentially government subsidies that help offset the costs of everything from health insurance to food to education, so that families in need can save their resources to help further their own economic growth. \nOr, in simpler terms, there are a whole range of federal programs out there to help low-income people so that there basic needs are met. That way they can focus on their own security, growth, health, safety and development. The federal government provides the funding for welfare programs, while states administer them and provide additional funds.\nThere are savings on health insurance through the . There\u2019s access to affordable housing through rental assistance programs. There\u2019s access to low- and no-cost early childhood education through Head Start. There is food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). And fortunately, those aren\u2019t the only government assistance programs out there. From the Supplemental Social Security Program to the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), here\u2019s our guide to the top 10 government programs available to low-income families.\n## Who qualifies for low-income government programs?\nRecipients of these kind of government benefits must prove their income is below a set amount, which is some percentage of the  you to be a United States citizen or an eligible non-citizen. And many programs have state requirements based on family size and details about combined family income.",

President Trump doubled down on this concept, tying them into the  he introduced. For now, the government agencies and departments that administer these programs are developing ways to introduce work requirements into many of these programs. \nAnd don\u2019t forget that welfare programs are not entitlement programs by definition. Entitlement programs, like Social Security and unemployment insurance, determine eligibility based on prior contributions from payroll taxes. Welfare programs, however, are based solely on a family\u2019s income level, and thus level of need. \nNow let\u2019s look at each of these government programs in more detail:\n### 1. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\nprovides eligible people with a benefits card, used like a debit card, to buy food at designated grocery stores and farmers markets. The SNAP program gives food vouchers to 47.6 million people or 23 million households. They receive $133 a month on average.\nIn addition to SNAP, there\u2019s a food stamp program for nursing mothers and young children called [The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).](https://www.healthsherpa.com/blog/wic-benefits-eligibility?utm_source=blog&utm_content=govbenefits) WIC provides food or vouchers, education, and referrals to help feed pregnant women and children up to age six. In 2017, 7.7 million people received WIC each month. \nFor school-aged children, there is the , which provides free or reduced-cost lunches to 30 million children. SNAP, WIC, and the Child Nutrition Program are all administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).",

The Housing Choice Voucher Program gives certificates to rent approved units. The subsidy allows recipients to pay no more than 30 percent of their income. It provides 1.2 million units of public housing and local agencies administer it to 2.2 million renters. This is the old Section 8 program. The Public Housing Agency also allows some families to use the voucher to purchase a modest home.\n[Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/programs/liheap) (LIHEAP), providing energy assistance and weatherization programs. It provides $3.4 billion in block grants to the states.\n### 6. Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI)\n[Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI)](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/ssi/) provides cash to low-income seniors and adults and kids with disabilities. It helps the  buy food, clothing, and shelter. On average, roughly 8.4 million people receive $536 per month. Of those, 7.3 million are blind or disabled.\n## Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\nAdministered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), TANF programs [provide cash for a limited time to low-income families working toward self-sufficiency](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/programs/tanf). TANF may also offer non-cash benefits such as child care or job training.\n[2.5 million recipients received income from TANF](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/resource/tanf-caseload-data-2017). Of these, 1.9 million were children. On average, a three-person family received $447 a month. Despite this help, they still live below the poverty line. Families who receive TANF must get a job within two years and can only receive this benefit for five years or less in some states. In addition, if they have another child and do not own more than $2,000 in total assets, they may not be eligible for more income."

Altogether, seven different cabinet agencies and six independent agencies administer at least one anti-poverty program. And those are just the programs specifically aimed at poverty.

The misery and poverty of the Great Depression threatened to overwhelm all these programs. The severe Depression of the 1930s made Federal action necessary, as neither the states and the local communities, businesses and industries, nor private charities had the financial resources to cope with the growing need among the American people. Beginning in 1932, the Federal Government first made loans, then grants, to states to pay for direct relief and work relief. After that, special Federal emergency relief like the and other public works programs were started. In 1935, President 's administration proposed to Congress federal social relief programs and a federally sponsored retirement program.

Publicly Released: Aug 31, 2015. \nMore than 80 federal programs (including 6 tax expenditures) provide aid to people with low incomes, based on GAO's survey of relevant federal agencies. Medicaid (the largest by far), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) comprised almost two-thirds of fiscal year 2013 federal obligations of $742 billion for these programs. Aid is most often targeted to groups of the low-income population, such as people with disabilities and workers with children. Survey responses showed that criteria used to determine eligibility vary greatly; most common were variants of the federal poverty guidelines, based on the Census Bureau's official poverty measure.\nIn 2013, 48.7 million people (15.5 percent), including many households with children, lived in poverty in the United States, based on Census's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). This measure takes into account certain expenses and federal and state government benefits not included in the official poverty measure. The SPM is not used to determine program eligibility; however, it does provide more information than the official measure on household resources available to meet living expenses. In 2013, the SPM poverty threshold ranged from $21,397 to $25,639 for a family of four, depending on housing situations. Based on six mutually exclusive household types GAO developed, individuals in a household headed by a person with a disability or a single parent had the highest rates of poverty using the SPM, while childless or married parent households had larger numbers of people in poverty using the SPM.",
              "In 2012, the most recent year of data available, GAO estimated that 106 million people, or one-third of the U.S. population, received benefits from at least one or more of eight selected federal low-income programs: Additional Child Tax Credit, EITC, SNAP, SSI, and four others. Almost two-thirds of the eight programs' recipients were in households with children, including many married families. More than 80 percent of recipients also lived in households with some earned income during the year. Without these programs' benefits, GAO estimated that 25 million of these recipients would have been below the SPM poverty threshold. Of the eight programs, EITC and SNAP moved the most people out of poverty, however, the majority of recipients of each of the programs were estimated to have incomes above the SPM threshold, after accounting for receipt of benefits.\nResearch suggests that assistance from selected means-tested low-income programs can encourage people's participation in the labor force, but have mixed effects on the number of hours they work. Changes in certain low-income programs through the years, including the EITC, have enhanced incentives for people to join the labor force, according to studies. While workers who receive means-tested benefits face benefit reductions as their earnings rise, research shows that various factors limit how much people change their work behavior in response. For example, people may not be aware of such changing interactions in a complex tax and benefit system or be able to control the number of hours they work, according to studies. Research also shows that enhancing work incentives can create difficult policy trade-offs, including raising program costs or failing to provide adequate assistance to those in need.\n##  Why GAO Did This Study",
              "The federal government provides assistance aimed at helping people with low-incomes who may earn too little to meet their basic needs, cannot support themselves through work, or who are disadvantaged in other ways. With fiscal pressures facing the federal government and the demands placed on aid programs, GAO was asked to examine federal low-income programs.\nThis report (1) describes federal programs (including tax expenditures) targeted to people with low incomes, (2) identifies the number and selected household characteristics of people in poverty, (3) identifies the number, poverty status, and household characteristics of selected programs' recipients, and (4) examines research on how selected programs may affect incentives to work. For a list of low-income programs that were $100 million in obligations or more in fiscal year 2013, GAO consulted with the Congressional Research Service; surveyed and interviewed officials at relevant federal agencies; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency guidance. GAO also conducted analyses on low-income individuals using Census data on the SPM and official poverty measure and microsimulation data from the Urban Institute that adjusts for under-reporting of benefit receipt in Census survey data. To examine labor force effects, GAO reviewed economic literature. Selected low-income programs were large in dollars and helped meet a range of basic needs.\nGAO is not making new recommendations in this report. GAO clarified portions in response to comments from one agency.\nFor more information, contact Kay Brown at (202) 512-7215 or ."

              "The EITC and SNAP are examples of \u201cmeans-tested\u201d programs, that is, programs that limit assistance to people with low or modest incomes. Other means-tested programs include Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for low-income seniors and people with disabilities; cash assistance programs funded by the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, and programs that provide non-cash benefits like housing assistance. In 2011, means-tested benefits lifted 19.7 million people above the poverty line, including 8.5 million children. (See Appendix Table 2 for state-by-state figures.) \nMedicaid and CHIP provided health insurance to 66 million Americans during 2010 \u2014 roughly 32 million children, 18 million parents, 10 million people with disabilities, and 6 million seniors. Medicaid and CHIP have greatly reduced the numbers of uninsured children and now provide coverage to most low-income children. \nTo be sure, some critics question the effects of safety net programs on individual behavior, such as work effort, and how that affects poverty. Several of the leading researchers in the field have conducted a comprehensive review of the available research and data on how safety net programs affect poverty, and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has published their results. They found that, after accounting for what the research finds to be modest overall behavioral effects, the safety net lowers the poverty rate by about 14 percentage points. In other words, _one of every seven Americans_ would be poor without the safety net but is above the poverty line because of it. That translates into more than 40 million people.\n## Safety Net Supports Working Families and Promotes Work \nOver the past three decades, policymakers changed the safety net substantially so that it now does to promote work and support low-income working families whose earnings aren\u2019t high enough to make ends meet \u2014 and to support low-income families that lack earnings.",

Extensive research indicates that these supports lift millions of Americans out of poverty, help \u201cmake work pay\u201d by supplementing low wages, and enable millions of Americans to receive health care who otherwise could not afford it. \nTo be sure, the United States still has a higher poverty rate than many other advanced countries, and many Americans reach adulthood without the tools they need to succeed in the workforce. Various programs and policies, especially in areas such as job training and education, could be reformed and strengthened. But the claim that advocates of shrinking government sometimes make that public efforts to reduce poverty and hardship have failed is belied by the evidence.\n  * Federal assistance lifts millions of people, including children, out of poverty and provides access to affordable health care. Public programs lifted 40 million people out of poverty in 2011, including almost 9 million children, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s Supplemental Poverty Measure, which counts non-cash benefits and taxes. While Social Security lifted the largest number of people overall out of poverty, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) lifted the largest number of children. Together, the EITC and Child Tax Credit (CTC) lifted 9.4 million people \u2014 including nearly 5 million children \u2014 out of poverty in 2011."

              "# Factsheet: What the research says about the economics of income support programs\nSufficient income is one of the most important components of a stable and healthy household budget. Income support programs help ensure that U.S. households have the income they need to cover the basic expenses of daily life. Some income support is delivered through direct cash transfers, including in programs such as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability Income, and Unemployment Insurance, while others provide essential goods such as food or housing to families, thus freeing up existing household income to be used for other purposes.\nYet the COVID-19 crisis demonstrates that existing income support infrastructure in the United States is in providing relief to those who needed it. Pandemic-specific income supports delivered through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act and related programs blunted some of the worst pain of the coronavirus recession, but they for income support due to sustained underinvestment in these vital programs over the past half-century.\nWhile both common sense and a make clear that income support improves the economic well-being of the people who access it, it\u2019s important not to overlook the effects these programs also have on the U.S. economy as a whole. This factsheet discusses the economic impacts of income support programs, who they reach, how racism prevents them from serving their economic function, and what policymakers can do about it, starting with the upcoming 2022 budget reconciliation negotiations.\n### The immediate economic impact of income support programs",
              "* During recessions, income support ensures people are still able to purchase goods and services, which softens theof economic downturns on the U.S. economy. For every dollar spent on UI benefits during the Great Recession, there was an in economic activity, and for every dollar spent on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, there was an in economic activity. \n  * Most studies find that income support from state paid leave programs increases labor force participation among mothers. Under California\u2019s paid leave law, for example, new mothers are estimated to be more likely to be working a year after the birth of their child. \n  * Other income support programs for families with children also boost labor force participation among mothers. A research by Taryn Morrissey of American University finds that providing income support to cover 10 percent of a household\u2019s child care costs results in a 0.5 percent to 2.5 percent increase in mothers\u2019 employment. Likewise, of the 1986 Earned Income Tax Credit expansion finds that this expanded income support resulted in a 2.8 percentage point increase in the labor force participation rate of single women with children. \n  * Income supports facilitate job matching, benefitting workers who find higher-paying jobs and firms that hire workers with the right skills for the job. Recent research finds that when U.S. workers have the income they need to meet their basic needs, they can take the time to find the right job for them, rather than taking the first work opportunity that comes along. For each additional week that a worker receives Unemployment Insurance, for example, the that they will be re-employed at a job that requires a higher level of education than their previous job. (See Figure 1.)",
              "The upcoming budget reconciliation negotiations offer a promising opportunity to enact these and other reforms to U.S. social infrastructure, including income support programs. These actions would not only benefit those U.S. workers and their families who need help the most, but also bolster the overall U.S. economy as it continues to recover from the coronavirus recession. \nFor more information, see Equitable Growth\u2019s issue brief, \u201c[Weak income support infrastructure harms U.S. workers and their families and constrains economic growth](https://equitablegrowth.org/weak-income-support-infrastructure-harms-u-s-workers-and-their-families-and-constrains-economic-growth/).\u201d\nAlix Gould-Werth, \u201cThe only thing better than strengthening federal social supports now to prevent a coronavirus recession is strengthening them forever\u201d (Washington: Washington Center for Equitable Growth, 2020), available at .\nZachary Parolin and others, \u201cMonthly Poverty Rates in the United States during the COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d (New York: Center on Poverty & Social Policy, 2020), available at ; Amanda Fischer and Alix Gould-Werth, \u201cBroken plumbing: How systems for delivering economic relief in response to the coronavirus recession failed the U.S. economy\u201d (Washington: Washington Center for Equitable Growth, 2020), available at ; Shawn Donnan and Reade Pickert, \u201cU.S. Unemployment Rescue Left at Least 9 Million Without Help,\u201d Bloomberg Businessweek, June 25, 2021, available at .\nArloc Sherman, Danilo Trisi, and Sharon Parrott. \u201cVarious Supports for Low-Income Families Reduce Poverty and Have Long-Term Positive Effects On Families and Children\u201d (Washington: Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 2021), available at .\nGabriel Chodorow-Reich and John Coglianese, \u201cUnemployment insurance and macroeconomic stabilization\u201d (Washington: The Brookings Institution, 2019), available at ."

              "Poverty is a multifaceted issue that will require multipronged approaches to address. Strategies that improve the economic mobility of families may help to alleviate the negative effects of poverty. For example, tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit alleviate financial burdens for families with lower and middle incomes by reducing the amount of taxes owed. In addition, federal social assistance programs are designed to provide safety net services and specifically benefit individuals and families with lower incomes. Two of the nation\u2019s largest social assistance programs are Medicaid, which provides health coverage, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food assistance. Medicaid and SNAP serve millions of people each year and have been associated with reductions in poverty along with overall health benefits. In order to reduce socioeconomic inequality, it may also be important to address factors that are associated with the health status of poor communities.

              "The better outcomes linked with stronger income assistance include healthier birth weights, lower maternal stress (measured by reduced stress hormone levels in the bloodstream), better childhood nutrition, higher reading and math test scores, higher high school graduation rates, less use of drugs and alcohol, and higher rates of college entry, the NAS committee noted.\nPolicymakers could substantially reduce poverty and racial inequities and advance opportunity for all children by adopting a range of policy proposals that the NAS panel evaluated, including expansion of housing vouchers and food assistance and making the Child Tax Credit larger and fully available to children in poor and low-income families, who now often get no credit or only a partial credit because their incomes are too low to qualify for the full credit based on its current design.\nMore recent analyses by Columbia University\u2019s Center on Poverty and Social Policy provide further evidence of how various policy proposals could substantially reduce child poverty and racial inequities. A child allowance like Canada\u2019s would reduce racial and ethnic poverty gaps by over half. A proposal to make housing vouchers available to all eligible families put forward by President Joe Biden during his campaign would reduce the white/Black poverty gap by up to a third and the white/Latino poverty gap by up to half. That proposal combined with two tax credit proposals endorsed by Vice President Kamala Harris would reduce racial and ethnic poverty gaps by even more.",
              "These kinds of policies will have stronger effects in a strong economy that provides ample employment opportunities to those seeking work. That requires robust stimulus policies during recessions and a continued commitment on the part of the Federal Reserve to pursuing full employment as an explicit and important policy goal. Moreover, we know that even when unemployment is low, some people face significant barriers to labor market success. Creating publicly subsidized employment programs that can help those struggling in the labor market \u2014 and expanding these efforts during periods of substantial slack in the labor market \u2014 can reduce employment disparities and expand economic opportunity.\n## 2017 Economy Bears Little Resemblance to Today\u2019s \nThe economy has changed significantly since 2017, the latest year of data in our poverty series that corrects for underreporting of key government benefits. In 2017 the overall poverty rate had been declining for three consecutive years. Likewise, poverty for the white, Black, and Latino subgroups had also declined from 2014 to 2017. Even so, the shares of Black and Latino people living in poverty, 20.9 and 20.1 percent, respectively, were still both more than double the share of white people living in poverty, 9.8 percent. In other words, Black and Latino people were more than twice as likely to experience poverty than white people in 2017.",
              "A long and continuing legacy of private-sector discrimination by employers, real estate companies, and others has also restricted opportunities for people of color in jobs, housing, and education. For example, a well-known experimental study found that resumes with stereotypically white-sounding names were 50 percent more likely to receive a callback than equivalent resumes with stereotypically Black-sounding names. And, beyond the discrimination associated with having a criminal record cited above, another experimental study found that Black and Latino individuals such a record were no more likely to receive a callback or job offer than similarly qualified white individuals a record.\n## Overall Poverty, Racial Inequities Would Be Much Higher if Not for Economic Security Programs \nEconomic security programs lifted 39 million people above the poverty line in 2017, including nearly 9 million children. Some 83 million people are below the poverty line when government assistance income and taxes are not considered, 44 million when they are. Government benefits and tax policies cut the poverty rate from 25.6 percent to 13.5 percent in 2017, and from 25.5 percent to 13.6 percent among children.\nEconomic security programs are particularly important in reducing racial disparities in child poverty. In 2017, government benefits and taxes reduced white child poverty by 7 percentage points, Black child poverty by 20 percentage points, and Latino child poverty by 16 percentage points, though poverty after accounting for government programs remains substantially higher among Black and Latino children than white children."

              "Figure B also demonstrates that rising prices played little-to-no role in the large increase in poverty. While high inflation curtailed many families\u2019 incomes in 2022, labor market gains completely offset inflation at the bottom of the income distribution, as through the bottom 30 percentile changed little between 2021 and 2022. Overall pre-tax poverty did not change last year, and poverty only increased using a broader measure of economic hardship that includes post-tax income.\nThere is also reason to think that the magnitude of the poverty increase was substantially larger than these figures suggest. Census models estimating the mechanical reduction in poverty due to the Child Tax Credit the size of payments received by families near poverty thresholds in 2021. As a result, poverty in 2021 may have been lower than we thought, raising the measured magnitude of the poverty increase in 2022.\nAlthough the strong labor market of 2023 will surely help to improve living standards and reduce poverty, it will nevertheless fall short of undoing the damage of letting key social assistance programs expire. Today\u2019s data indicating a sharp increase in 2022 reveal how much poverty the country tolerates is a policy choice.\nSign up for EPI's newsletter so you never miss our research and insights on ways to make the economy work better for everyone.\nGet new research, insightful graphics, and event invites from EPI sent to your inbox every week. \nPlease enter a valid email."

These programs enhance productivity by facilitating better job matching and labor market resilience [1].\n- - **Employment Outcomes:** Increased social supports, including paid leave and childcare subsidies, raise labor force participation, especially among parents and low-income workers. Historical expansions of benefits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) have notably increased workforce participation rates among single mothers\u2014by up to 2.8 percentage points. These supports also improve job quality by allowing individuals to find roles aligned with their skills [1].\n- - **Poverty Reduction and Inequality:** Strengthening federal assistance significantly reduces poverty and narrows income and racial disparities. Safety net programs previously lifted 39 million people above the poverty line, and targeted expansions (e.g., universal housing vouchers, child tax credits) could further cut racial poverty gaps by up to 50 percent [2][3].\n- - **Long-Term Social and Fiscal Benefits:** Early-life interventions via programs like Medicaid and SNAP improve health, educational achievement, and future earnings, leading to higher tax revenues and reduced public costs over time. These investments act as catalysts for intergenerational mobility and long-term economic self-sufficiency [4].\n- - **Fiscal and Macroeconomic Conclusions:** While initial spending increases are substantial, the evidence suggests substantial fiscal returns through enhanced productivity, higher lifetime earnings, and lower social expenditures.

These programs are essentially government subsidies that help offset the costs of everything from health insurance to food to education, so that families in need can save their resources to help further their own economic growth. \nOr, in simpler terms, there are a whole range of federal programs out there to help low-income people so that there basic needs are met. That way they can focus on their own security, growth, health, safety and development. The federal government provides the funding for welfare programs, while states administer them and provide additional funds.\nThere are savings on health insurance through the . There\u2019s access to affordable housing through rental assistance programs. There\u2019s access to low- and no-cost early childhood education through Head Start. There is food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). And fortunately, those aren\u2019t the only government assistance programs out there. From the Supplemental Social Security Program to the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), here\u2019s our guide to the top 10 government programs available to low-income families.\n## Who qualifies for low-income government programs?\nRecipients of these kind of government benefits must prove their income is below a set amount, which is some percentage of the  you to be a United States citizen or an eligible non-citizen.

President Trump doubled down on this concept, tying them into the  he introduced. For now, the government agencies and departments that administer these programs are developing ways to introduce work requirements into many of these programs. \nAnd don\u2019t forget that welfare programs are not entitlement programs by definition. Entitlement programs, like Social Security and unemployment insurance, determine eligibility based on prior contributions from payroll taxes. Welfare programs, however, are based solely on a family\u2019s income level, and thus level of need. \nNow let\u2019s look at each of these government programs in more detail:\n### 1. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\nprovides eligible people with a benefits card, used like a debit card, to buy food at designated grocery stores and farmers markets. The SNAP program gives food vouchers to 47.6 million people or 23 million households. They receive $133 a month on average.\nIn addition to SNAP, there\u2019s a food stamp program for nursing mothers and young children called [The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).](https://www.healthsherpa.com/blog/wic-benefits-eligibility?utm_source=blog&utm_content=govbenefits) WIC provides food or vouchers, education, and referrals to help feed pregnant women and children up to age six. In 2017, 7.7 million people received WIC each month. \nFor school-aged children, there is the , which provides free or reduced-cost lunches to 30 million children. SNAP, WIC, and the Child Nutrition Program are all administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).",
              "helps low-income families, seniors, and people with disabilities get into affordable private or government-owned rental housing. The Housing Choice Voucher Program gives certificates to rent approved units. The subsidy allows recipients to pay no more than 30 percent of their income. It provides 1.2 million units of public housing and local agencies administer it to 2.2 million renters. This is the old Section 8 program. The Public Housing Agency also allows some families to use the voucher to purchase a modest home.\n[Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/programs/liheap) (LIHEAP), providing energy assistance and weatherization programs. It provides $3.4 billion in block grants to the states.\n### 6. Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI)\n[Supplemental Security Income Program (SSI)](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/ssi/) provides cash to low-income seniors and adults and kids with disabilities. It helps the  buy food, clothing, and shelter. On average, roughly 8.4 million people receive $536 per month. Of those, 7.3 million are blind or disabled.\n## Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\nAdministered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), TANF programs [provide cash for a limited time to low-income families working toward self-sufficiency](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/programs/tanf). TANF may also offer non-cash benefits such as child care or job training.\n[2.5 million recipients received income from TANF](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/resource/tanf-caseload-data-2017). Of these, 1.9 million were children. On average, a three-person family received $447 a month. Despite this help, they still live below the poverty line. Families who receive TANF must get a job within two years and can only receive this benefit for five years or less in some states. In addition, if they have another child and do not own more than $2,000 in total assets, they may not be eligible for more income."

Some 70 of them provide cash or in-kind benefits to individuals, while the remainder target specific groups or disadvantaged neighborhoods or communities.\nThere are eight different health care programs administered by five separate agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services. Six cabinet departments and five independent agencies oversee 27 cash or general-assistance programs. Altogether, seven different cabinet agencies and six independent agencies administer at least one anti-poverty program. And those are just the programs specifically aimed at poverty. That doesn\u2019t include more universal social welfare programs or social insurance programs, such as unemployment insurance, Medicare, or Social Security.\nAltogether, the federal government spends more than $1.1 trillion a year on 134 welfare programs. State and local governments add about $744 billion more. Thus, government at all levels is spending roughly $1.8 trillion per year to fight poverty (Figure 1).

The misery and poverty of the Great Depression threatened to overwhelm all these programs. The severe Depression of the 1930s made Federal action necessary, as neither the states and the local communities, businesses and industries, nor private charities had the financial resources to cope with the growing need among the American people. Beginning in 1932, the Federal Government first made loans, then grants, to states to pay for direct relief and work relief. After that, special Federal emergency relief like the and other public works programs were started. In 1935, President 's administration proposed to Congress federal social relief programs and a federally sponsored retirement program.

              "Published: Jul 30, 2015. Publicly Released: Aug 31, 2015. \nMore than 80 federal programs (including 6 tax expenditures) provide aid to people with low incomes, based on GAO's survey of relevant federal agencies. Medicaid (the largest by far), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) comprised almost two-thirds of fiscal year 2013 federal obligations of $742 billion for these programs. Aid is most often targeted to groups of the low-income population, such as people with disabilities and workers with children. Survey responses showed that criteria used to determine eligibility vary greatly; most common were variants of the federal poverty guidelines, based on the Census Bureau's official poverty measure.\nIn 2013, 48.7 million people (15.5 percent), including many households with children, lived in poverty in the United States, based on Census's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). This measure takes into account certain expenses and federal and state government benefits not included in the official poverty measure. The SPM is not used to determine program eligibility; however, it does provide more information than the official measure on household resources available to meet living expenses. In 2013, the SPM poverty threshold ranged from $21,397 to $25,639 for a family of four, depending on housing situations. Based on six mutually exclusive household types GAO developed, individuals in a household headed by a person with a disability or a single parent had the highest rates of poverty using the SPM, while childless or married parent households had larger numbers of people in poverty using the SPM.",
              "In 2012, the most recent year of data available, GAO estimated that 106 million people, or one-third of the U.S. population, received benefits from at least one or more of eight selected federal low-income programs: Additional Child Tax Credit, EITC, SNAP, SSI, and four others. Almost two-thirds of the eight programs' recipients were in households with children, including many married families. More than 80 percent of recipients also lived in households with some earned income during the year. Without these programs' benefits, GAO estimated that 25 million of these recipients would have been below the SPM poverty threshold. Of the eight programs, EITC and SNAP moved the most people out of poverty, however, the majority of recipients of each of the programs were estimated to have incomes above the SPM threshold, after accounting for receipt of benefits.\nResearch suggests that assistance from selected means-tested low-income programs can encourage people's participation in the labor force, but have mixed effects on the number of hours they work. Changes in certain low-income programs through the years, including the EITC, have enhanced incentives for people to join the labor force, according to studies. While workers who receive means-tested benefits face benefit reductions as their earnings rise, research shows that various factors limit how much people change their work behavior in response. For example, people may not be aware of such changing interactions in a complex tax and benefit system or be able to control the number of hours they work, according to studies. Research also shows that enhancing work incentives can create difficult policy trade-offs, including raising program costs or failing to provide adequate assistance to those in need.\n##  Why GAO Did This Study",
              "The federal government provides assistance aimed at helping people with low-incomes who may earn too little to meet their basic needs, cannot support themselves through work, or who are disadvantaged in other ways. With fiscal pressures facing the federal government and the demands placed on aid programs, GAO was asked to examine federal low-income programs.\nThis report (1) describes federal programs (including tax expenditures) targeted to people with low incomes, (2) identifies the number and selected household characteristics of people in poverty, (3) identifies the number, poverty status, and household characteristics of selected programs' recipients, and (4) examines research on how selected programs may affect incentives to work. For a list of low-income programs that were $100 million in obligations or more in fiscal year 2013, GAO consulted with the Congressional Research Service; surveyed and interviewed officials at relevant federal agencies; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency guidance. GAO also conducted analyses on low-income individuals using Census data on the SPM and official poverty measure and microsimulation data from the Urban Institute that adjusts for under-reporting of benefit receipt in Census survey data. To examine labor force effects, GAO reviewed economic literature. Selected low-income programs were large in dollars and helped meet a range of basic needs.\nGAO is not making new recommendations in this report. GAO clarified portions in response to comments from one agency.\nFor more information, contact Kay Brown at (202) 512-7215 or ."

              "The EITC and SNAP are examples of \u201cmeans-tested\u201d programs, that is, programs that limit assistance to people with low or modest incomes. Other means-tested programs include Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for low-income seniors and people with disabilities; cash assistance programs funded by the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, and programs that provide non-cash benefits like housing assistance. In 2011, means-tested benefits lifted 19.7 million people above the poverty line, including 8.5 million children. (See Appendix Table 2 for state-by-state figures.) \nMedicaid and CHIP provided health insurance to 66 million Americans during 2010 \u2014 roughly 32 million children, 18 million parents, 10 million people with disabilities, and 6 million seniors. Medicaid and CHIP have greatly reduced the numbers of uninsured children and now provide coverage to most low-income children. \nTo be sure, some critics question the effects of safety net programs on individual behavior, such as work effort, and how that affects poverty. Several of the leading researchers in the field have conducted a comprehensive review of the available research and data on how safety net programs affect poverty, and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has published their results. They found that, after accounting for what the research finds to be modest overall behavioral effects, the safety net lowers the poverty rate by about 14 percentage points. In other words, _one of every seven Americans_ would be poor without the safety net but is above the poverty line because of it. That translates into more than 40 million people.\n## Safety Net Supports Working Families and Promotes Work \nOver the past three decades, policymakers changed the safety net substantially so that it now does to promote work and support low-income working families whose earnings aren\u2019t high enough to make ends meet \u2014 and to support low-income families that lack earnings.",

Extensive research indicates that these supports lift millions of Americans out of poverty, help \u201cmake work pay\u201d by supplementing low wages, and enable millions of Americans to receive health care who otherwise could not afford it. \nTo be sure, the United States still has a higher poverty rate than many other advanced countries, and many Americans reach adulthood without the tools they need to succeed in the workforce. Various programs and policies, especially in areas such as job training and education, could be reformed and strengthened. But the claim that advocates of shrinking government sometimes make that public efforts to reduce poverty and hardship have failed is belied by the evidence.\n  * Federal assistance lifts millions of people, including children, out of poverty and provides access to affordable health care. Public programs lifted 40 million people out of poverty in 2011, including almost 9 million children, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s Supplemental Poverty Measure, which counts non-cash benefits and taxes. While Social Security lifted the largest number of people overall out of poverty, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) lifted the largest number of children. Together, the EITC and Child Tax Credit (CTC) lifted 9.4 million people \u2014 including nearly 5 million children \u2014 out of poverty in 2011."

These programs are essentially government subsidies that help offset the costs of everything from health insurance to food to education, so that families in need can save their resources to help further their own economic growth. \nOr, in simpler terms, there are a whole range of federal programs out there to help low-income people so that there basic needs are met.
