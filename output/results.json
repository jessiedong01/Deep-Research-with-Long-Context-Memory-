  "writeup": "# **Should the United States Adopt Stablecoin as an Official Digital Currency?**\n\n---\n\n## **Root Conclusion**\n\nBased on a multi-domain examination of the economic, regulatory, and technological implications, the United States **should not immediately adopt stablecoin as its official digital currency**. Instead, it should **pursue a phased adoption strategy**, beginning with regulatory harmonization, infrastructure modernization, and limited pilot programs. This staged approach would allow the U.S. to capture the **efficiency and inclusivity benefits** of stablecoins while **safeguarding financial stability and policy control**.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Introduction**\n\nStablecoins are digital currencies pegged to stable reference assets\u2014typically fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or government securities. These instruments aim to combine the stability of traditional money with the efficiency of blockchain-based payments.  \nFor the United States, designating an official stablecoin would fundamentally reshape the monetary and financial ecosystem, influencing **liquidity management**, **payment efficiency**, and **monetary policy transmission**.  \n\nThis report evaluates whether such adoption is advisable, focusing on three critical dimensions:\n\n1. **Economic implications** \u2013 covering efficiency, inclusion, and systemic stability.  \n2. **Regulatory and policy frameworks** \u2013 assessing oversight and legal readiness.  \n3. **Technological and infrastructural feasibility** \u2013 evaluating operational capacity and risks.\n\nThe analysis integrates findings across all nodes of investigation to synthesize an informed policy recommendation.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Economic Implications of U.S. Stablecoin Adoption**\n\n### **2.1 Overview**\n\nAdopting a U.S. official stablecoin holds potential to **enhance payment speed, reduce transaction costs, and broaden financial inclusion** [node_2][node_6]. However, it could also reshape the foundations of liquidity and asset markets, demanding recalibration of monetary policy instruments [node_5].\n\n### **2.2 Impacts on Financial Stability and Monetary Policy Control**\n\nA U.S. stablecoin would likely **improve operational efficiency** but may complicate how the Federal Reserve manages liquidity and funding conditions. Integration with Treasury and money markets could stabilize short-term funding demand but expose these markets to redemption pressures and forced asset liquidation during stress events [node_5][node_2].  \nWhile embedding stablecoin management under the Federal Reserve could control run risks, it would blur boundaries between **monetary operations and payment infrastructure**, necessitating governance clarity [node_5]. Internationally, global usage could reinforce the dollar\u2019s influence but provoke political concerns over monetary sovereignty [node_5].  \n\nThus, while promising for payment efficiency, the macroeconomic and policy risks require **precise design and oversight mechanisms** to prevent financial instability.\n\n### **2.3 Efficiency and Inclusivity in Payment Systems**\n\nThe economic upside is substantial: stablecoin transactions support **real-time settlement, continuous operation beyond banking hours**, and significant **cost reduction by removing intermediaries** [node_6].  \nThrough blockchain transparency, every transaction is verifiable, reducing reconciliation errors and improving auditability. Smart contracts could automate obligations such as payrolls, escrow functions, and supply-chain payments, enhancing efficiency further [node_6].  \nMoreover, digital wallets could expand **financial inclusion**, offering unbanked and underbanked Americans access to secure, affordable payment tools. However, these benefits depend on **digital infrastructure accessibility** and **strong privacy protections**.  \n\n### **2.4 Summary of Economic Findings**\n\nEconomically, a U.S. stablecoin could **boost efficiency and inclusivity** while enabling real-time transparency\u2014a clear policy advantage. However, it also reshapes the **liquidity ecosystem** and challenges existing policy control mechanisms. The economic readiness for adoption thus depends on ensuring that design safeguards prevent **liquidity dislocation and monetary confusion** during implementation.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Regulatory and Policy Frameworks**\n\n### **3.1 Overview**\n\nThe current U.S. regulatory environment for stablecoins is **fragmented**, with oversight diffused across multiple federal and state agencies\u2014including the Federal Reserve, Treasury, OCC, FDIC, FinCEN, and state authorities such as the NYDFS [node_3][node_7]. This complexity creates inconsistent reserve and redemption requirements and undermines unified compliance enforcement.\n\n### **3.2 Regulatory Bodies and Statutory Changes Required**\n\nUnder reforms like the **GENIUS Act**, stablecoins would form a distinct category called **\u201cpayment stablecoins,\u201d** exempt from classification as securities or commodities. Federal oversight would concentrate primarily within **banking regulators** [node_7].  \n\nPrimary responsibilities would be distributed as follows:  \n- **Treasury, Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC** \u2013 overarching supervision of issuers and prudential standards.  \n- **OCC** \u2013 national chartering for qualified issuers.  \n- **FinCEN** \u2013 AML/CFT enforcement under the Bank Secrecy Act [node_7].  \n- **State regulators (e.g., NYDFS)** \u2013 continued oversight of state-licensed money transmitters for consumer protection [node_7].  \n\nThis structure aims to reduce regulatory arbitrage and promote uniform reserve and redemption standards.\n\n### **3.3 Comparison with International Frameworks**\n\nThe **EU\u2019s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)** and **Japan\u2019s Payment Services Law (PSP)** showcase centralized, cohesive oversight models with clear mandate integration.  \n\n| Jurisdiction | Supervisory Model | Reserve Standards | Issuer Requirements | Key Distinctions |\n|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| **U.S. (GENIUS Act)** | Dual-tier federal/state oversight | 1:1 asset backing in cash/T-bills | Bank & nonbank issuers; partial federal charter | Lacks unified access to Fed payment rails |\n| **EU (MiCA)** | Centralized EBA-led oversight | Full reserve and disclosure mandates | Single license, cross-member recognition | Holistic financial integration & ESG disclosures |\n| **Japan (PSP Law)** | Centralized under FSA | Full fiat backing, redemption guarantees | Banks & trust companies exclusively | Unified structure, national accountability |\n\n[node_8]\n\nInternational models demonstrate that **centralized and transparent supervision** ensures consistency and enhances market confidence\u2014an area where U.S. frameworks remain underdeveloped.\n\n### **3.4 Policy Reform Pathways**\n\nTo achieve operational readiness, the U.S. should:  \n1. Establish **a unified federal charter** for payment stablecoin issuers under OCC.  \n2. Mandate **1:1 reserve backing** with regular third-party attestations.  \n3. Clarify federal-state boundaries to eliminate redundancy and conflicting oversight.  \n4. Pursue **reciprocal international agreements** with the EU and Japan for cross-border compliance alignment [node_3].  \n\nThese measures would enhance policy coherence and foster global interoperability.\n\n### **3.5 Summary of Regulatory Findings**\n\nRegulatory fragmentation remains the **greatest obstacle** to full stablecoin adoption. Without harmonization, economic and technical advantages cannot be realized. The adoption roadmap must therefore **begin with legislative and institutional reform**.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Technological and Infrastructure Feasibility**\n\n### **4.1 Overview**\n\nStablecoin functionality relies on blockchain technology, providing a decentralized yet auditable ledger for real-time value transfer. To meet national-scale requirements, the system must support **security, scalability, and compliance automation** [node_4][node_9][node_10].\n\n### **4.2 Technical Requirements for Secure and Scalable Deployment**\n\nCritical technical components include:  \n- **Secure MPC wallet systems** and real-time reconciliation engines for safekeeping and transaction validity [node_9].  \n- **Smart contract audits** and programmable compliance tools ensuring AML/KYT integration and regulatory reporting [node_9].  \n- **Governance frameworks** featuring multi-signature authorizations and coordinated emergency responses [node_9].  \n- **Reserve management infrastructure** ensuring 1:1 liquidity backing and continuous third-party audit [node_9].  \n- **Cross-chain interoperability and multi-chain deployment** for resilience and redundancy [node_9].  \n\n### **4.3 Integration with Banking and Payment Systems**\n\nExisting banking and payment systems can be connected to blockchain-ledgers through **API-based bridges** [node_10]. These APIs facilitate:  \n- Fiat-to-stablecoin conversions and liquidity on/off ramps.  \n- Instant transaction settlement with embedded compliance screening (KYC/AML).  \n- Ledger synchronization for accounting and audit readiness.  \n\nHowever, seamless integration requires **upgrading legacy banking software, harmonizing identity standards**, and reinforcing cybersecurity across both private and public infrastructures [node_4].\n\n### **4.4 Summary of Technological Findings**\n\nTechnologically, stablecoin adoption is **feasible but infrastructure dependent**. While most foundational technologies exist, national-scale deployment demands broad modernization\u2014particularly in **identity, interoperability, and cybersecurity frameworks**. Gradual rollout through **federally supervised pilots** would mitigate operational risks and enhance public confidence.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Integrated Analysis and Discussion**\n\n### **Interdependencies Across Domains**\n\nEconomic, regulatory, and technological dimensions are tightly interlinked:  \n- Economic benefits (efficiency and inclusion) rely on **regulatory stability and interoperability**.  \n- Regulatory clarity influences **technological design** by defining compliance parameters.  \n- Technological readiness determines how effectively **policy can be enforced in practice**.  \n\nA robust adoption trajectory therefore requires **synchronizing reform across these domains**. Regulatory reform catalyzes infrastructure investment, which in turn strengthens economic performance while preserving stability.\n\n### **Trade-offs and Transitional Approaches**\n\nA rush to full adoption could jeopardize financial stability and international confidence. Conversely, **incremental pilots** offer a balance between innovation and risk control. The U.S. can learn from smaller-scale implementations (e.g., central bank digital currency prototypes) before nationwide rollout.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Conclusion and Recommendations**\n\nThe comprehensive analysis indicates that the U.S. **should not immediately adopt stablecoin as an official digital currency**, but rather **progressively develop and pilot** such initiatives under unified regulatory oversight.\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n\n- **Economic:** Stablecoins promise efficiency and inclusivity gains but risk liquidity disruption if poorly integrated [node_5][node_6].  \n- **Regulatory:** Fragmented oversight is a critical vulnerability; harmonization modeled after EU and Japan\u2019s frameworks is essential [node_3][node_7][node_8].  \n- **Technological:** Secure, scalable integration is achievable but contingent on infrastructure modernization [node_4][node_9][node_10].  \n\n### **Recommendation**\n\nAdopt a **phased implementation strategy**:\n1. Enact cohesive federal legislation defining payment-stablecoin standards.  \n2. Modernize banking infrastructure and bolster cybersecurity.  \n3. Conduct government-supervised **pilot programs** integrating limited-use stablecoins within controlled financial environments.  \n4. Collaborate internationally to establish interoperability and mutual recognition of compliance regimes.\n\nThrough this **deliberate, sequenced approach**, the U.S. can capture the benefits of digital currency innovation while upholding financial sovereignty, regulatory integrity, and systemic resilience.\n\n---\n\n## **7.

        "Stablecoins offer users several advantages. For starters, they are designed to maintain a stable value, making them less volatile than other cryptocurrencies. They are also programmable, which means they can be automatically managed and controlled. This makes them a relatively reliable medium of exchange within the blockchain universe.\n\u201cStablecoins are a digital, on-chain form of fiat money. They are easy to self-custody and transact, and they are also fast, particularly in the context of cross-border money movement. One could even consider them a better form than fiat, as they can move quicker and less expensively across existing financial infrastructure in certain circumstances,\u201d Worthington said. As such, they are well-suited for the traditional financial services system, where the movement of cash needs to keep pace with transactions that are increasingly executed outside of usual business hours.\nOn the flip side, stablecoins could pose a threat to financial stability. For instance, stablecoins could have significant run risks, in which a large group of investors redeem their holdings simultaneously. \u201cThe collapse of TerraUSD in May 2022 highlights just how quickly a run can occur, in an asset class that trades 24/7,\u201d Ho remarked. The effects of a massive liquidation could spill over to other markets, destabilizing the traditional banking system.\nIn addition, the [Bank for International Settlements (BIS)](https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2025e3.htm) posits that stablecoins fall short on three key tests for money:\n  * Stablecoins that are traded in secondary markets might be exchanged at a slight deviation from par with the fiat currency they are pegged to.\n  * The issuer\u2019s balance sheet cannot be expanded at will, and any additional supply of stablecoins would require full upfront payment by its holders.",
        "In addition, the bill establishes strict reserve requirements, mandating that each stablecoin be backed one-to-one with U.S. dollars, short-term Treasuries and other high-quality assets. However, it is unclear whether non-bank stablecoin issuers will have access to the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, which is critical when it comes to addressing run risks.\n\u201cClearly, these developments are still very much in their nascent phase. But one thing is for certain \u2014 there is more to come as the industry continues to explore product innovation to integrate stablecoins into the traditional financial system,\u201d Ho said. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early to know how this will play out, but it could potentially challenge how we think about liquidity in the money markets over the longer term.\u201d \nListen to our latest episode from Making Sense: How stablecoins are reshaping global finance\nIn this episode, Kenneth Worthington, a Brokers, Asset Managers and Exchanges equity analyst at J.P. Morgan, is joined by Teresa Ho, head of U.S. Short Duration Strategy, to explore the dynamic world of stablecoins. Together, they break down what stablecoins are, how they work and why they\u2019re gaining so much attention in today\u2019s financial landscape. The discussion covers how stablecoins differ from deposits and money market funds, the impact of recent legislation such as the GENIUS Act, as well as what all this could mean for the future of finance."

        "* Overseas challenges of dollarization and sanctions evasion: Some enthusiasts are excited about the idea of perpetuating US dollar usage abroad with USD stablecoins. However, this overlooks serious risks to the foreign country. Unintended dollarization, or more generally, currency substitution, by reducing the effectiveness of its monetary policy for managing business cycles. Namely, the local central bank would normally be able to manage the cost and value of its currency as one tool to provide relief in recession. This is less effective when households and firms hold less of this currency.The use of stablecoins today sanctions should also be noted. Tether\u2019s USD stablecoin, for instance, has enabled billions of dollars in sanctions evasion globally.Because of the risks of illegal activity, including the evasion of sanctions and other measures, currency substitution, and other challenges, authorities abroad may take measures to limit stablecoin usage in foreign currency in their jurisdictions. In Europe, the stablecoin regulation enables authorities to restrict non-euro stablecoin usage in the region if it interferes with monetary sovereignty, monetary policy, or financial stability."

        "If Treasury bill supply expanded dramatically, this would likely change the shape of the aggregate deposit franchise, but would not directly disintermediate on net, as the Treasury funds are spent into the economy as they normally would be. There\u2019s some disintermediation in the sense of the shift in the curve of total demand for Treasury assets.\nWhile short-term repos against long-term Treasuries likely don\u2019t transfer much of the duration risk of long-term Treasuries to the stablecoin, some of it could remain\u2014such as when 30-year bond prices fell by \u22488% in a week in March 2020 (particularly if stablecoin disclosure requirements are such that markets can see the collateral exposure).\nThe greater financial stability risk here is tying the supply of funding in money markets to crypto market cap. When cryptoasset market cap goes up, the supply of stablecoins needs to grow\u2014and vice versa.\nThat means that when crypto assets fall, money market funding is . This is likely manageable in \u201cnormal\u201d times for, though less so if the stablecoin market does indeed grow substantially. And certainly less so if it happens alongside a systemic event.\n\u201cDeposits in insured depository institutions\u201d is a common, unfortunate phrase, because it implies the institution is insured\u2014rather than deposits up to $250,000. (Yes, in a systemiccrisis, there are mechanisms by which larger amounts can be protected.)\nWe saw the risks to the stablecoin itself of holding reserves in banks when USDC was trading at less than 90 cents on the dollar while SVB\u2019s depositors\u2019 fate was uncertain; when they were rescued, redeeming USDC still faced  of USDC\u2019s bank deposit partners prior to March 2023 is surreal in hindsight\nHowever, this dynamic only turns stablecoins into a financial stability risk if they grow tremendously, such as along the lines of the Standard Chartered estimates.",
        "The greater financial stability risk here, even at current stablecoin market caps, is akin to that noted for Treasury-backed repos: the tying of senior financial system funding (deposits in this case) to crypto market cap. That it\u2019s typically been mid-sized banks servicing crypto means stablecoin (and other crypto) deposits can represent a material part of the funding profile (and the market\u2019s view of their )\u2014again, particularly if the stablecoin market grows.\nAnd, to the extent the stablecoin market grows by coming into its own as a retail payment product, stablecoins would be effectively gathering insured (stable) deposits and , uninsured deposits concentrated in the banks servicing these clients.\nBitcoin, commodities, foreign commercial paper, whatever. Ironically, this is the one with the least financial stability risk if the stablecoin market remains around its current size and with current transaction purposes, which are, so far,  beyond participating in the crypto ecosystem. Risky assets forming the backing reserve has the least financial stability risk because stablecoin market cap can ebb and flow dramatically in this world and only affect the markets for risk assets, rather than systemically important funding markets.\nIf, however, nonbank stablecoins become a $1T+ market used for mainly real-economy transactions, then there\u2019s financial stability risk in the  losing any money, and you don\u2019t want this risky stuff backing any par liabilities that aren\u2019t issued by a regulated bank. Avoiding the risks in holding these kinds of assets has seemed to be Congress\u2019s primary motivation since it began drafting stablecoin bills. (If stablecoins stay small, however, avoiding such assets is great (stablecoin) consumer protection but may actually be a net negative for financial stability proper.)\nSubscribe below to receive directly to your inbox.

        "On that basis, any institution engaged in payments activity today may want to begin preparations for engaging with tokenized cash, while institutions whose business relies on legacy technology should actively develop capabilities to support this new payment method.\n## Why stablecoins have grown in popularity\nThe current wave of modernization of payments infrastructure was born out of a growing need to address perennial problems. These include the following:\n  * Delays in settlement of one to three business days are common when using traditional payment rails, especially when sending payments cross-border.\n  * Traditional payment processing typically involves multiple intermediaries (for example, correspondent banks and clearing houses); as a result, this process can generate multiple fees.\n  * Complex legacy infrastructure can obscure the routing and status of payments, especially during international transfers.\n  * Payment systems reliant on the traditional banking system usually only operate during business hours, which do not include weekends and holidays.\n  * Since much of the traditional payments infrastructure relies on banks, many people are underserved or excluded by KYC regulations and face other access hurdles such as the need for a state-issued ID or multiple proofs of residence.",
        "In addition, the creation of domestic payment systems (often unique to continents and even to individual markets) has led to many siloed systems and proprietary networks, making true global integration of payments difficult to achieve (Exhibit 2).\nImage description: A table compares legacy payment rails and stablecoin across speed, cost, cross-border, automation and programmability, security, transparency, settlement risks, and availability. Overall, stablecoins offer transformative capabilities that address key limitations of legacy payment systems, such as increased speed; lower costs; borderless, minimal, or nonexistent foreign transaction fees; and 24/7 operations. End of image description.\nOn top of these perennial issues, there has been a proliferation of needs, including merchant settlements, business-to-business payments, cross-border payments, retail remittances, and automated payments (for example, from government). As a result, demand has grown in the past decade for more-responsive, real-time, low-cost, secure, and inclusive global payment solutions.\nSome incumbents historically may have hesitated to pursue innovative payment systems in part because they might disrupt existing revenue lines. Competition among financial institutions has stymied efforts to collaborate, while a lack of standardization and consistent international regulations has prevented the emergence of a modern, global system. However, we believe such incumbents should continue to innovate, even if this might compete with existing revenue streams. Value drivers of existing legacy payment systems, such as ubiquity of acceptance and consumer protections, suggest they are not about to disappear.",

        "## How do stablecoins impact cross-border business payments compared to traditional methods? \nStablecoins most clearly outperform traditional payments when it comes to cross-border transactions.\nInternational wire transfers move via the network. A payment might pass through five or more correspondent banks, each taking a cut and delaying settlement. Funds can spend up to a week in transit with little visibility into where they are at any given moment. Costs add up quickly through up-front charges, extra fees per intermediary, and a percentage in FX spread. To mitigate them, companies often prefund accounts abroad, which ties up working capital. In some markets, local cards or banks simply can\u2019t connect internationally, which excludes entire customer segments.\nA stablecoin transfer removes the intermediaries, goes directly from sender to recipient, and is visible in real time on a public ledger. Settlement takes minutes, and blockchain costs are low. Contractors or vendors in can receive digital dollars even without a US bank account. In countries with volatile currencies, stablecoins can hold the steady value that local systems can\u2019t provide.\nStablecoins can reduce costs, open up new customer bases, and remove the opacity that has long plagued international money movement.\n## What are the compliance and regulatory considerations for stablecoins compared to traditional payments? \nTraditional payment networks follow mature rulebooks. Banks enforce Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, card networks build in consumer protections, and regulators have had decades to refine oversight. Banks and processors typically handle compliance.",
        "Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to a real-world asset, often a fiat currency such as the US dollar (USD) or , and are designed to hold steady value. One , for example, is designed to always equal roughly one dollar because it\u2019s backed by USD reserves. Businesses use stablecoins because they combine crypto\u2019s speed and reach with fiat\u2019s predictability.\nA typical payment works like this: a customer sends stablecoins from their digital wallet to the business\u2019s wallet and settlement occurs within minutes. There are no bank cutoff times and no pending statuses. Companies can keep the tokens for future payments or instantly convert them into local currency through a provider like .\n## What are the traditional payment methods in business? \nBusinesses still regularly move money through familiar networks: cards, bank transfers, and\u2014to a lesser extent\u2014cash or checks. Traditional networks are well known and universal but are generally slower, subject to higher fees, and restricted by banking hours. Here\u2019s a closer look at each method:\n  * These transactions depend on like Visa and Mastercard, with issuing banks, acquiring banks, and processors in the mix. The purchase feels instant to the customer, but businesses usually wait 1\u20133 days for settlement and pay a percentage of the transaction amount plus a flat fee.\n  * Making transfers through your bank is inexpensive but can take days. Wire transfers are faster but involve higher fees and sometimes hidden foreign exchange markups. Payments that are routed through multiple correspondent banks can take up to a week.\n  * While cash and checks are still used in some markets, they\u2019re costly to handle and painfully slow to clear.",
        "## How do stablecoin payments work for businesses compared to traditional payments? \nFundamentally, both and traditional payments do the same thing: they move value from the customer to the business. But stablecoins are an internet-native payment method with instant finality, while traditional methods rely on legacy institutions, intermediaries, and multiday settlement. Here\u2019s how each payment type works.\nA business provides a digital wallet address. The customer sends the agreed amount. Within minutes, the tokens settle on a blockchain and land in the business\u2019s wallet. The transfer is visible on a public network and it can\u2019t be reversed once it\u2019s confirmed. There are no bank intermediaries or cutoff times for processing. The business can hold stablecoins to pay suppliers or hedge against local volatility, or it can instantly convert them to local currency through an exchange or processor.\nCard flows run through layers, from the payment processor to the to the card network to the issuing bank. The business receives authorization instantly, but funds settle in batches a few days later. Direct deposits are slower still: domestic wire transfers can be same-day, but international ones often take days and pass through multiple correspondent banks. Some of these systems allow reversals (e.g., chargebacks on cards).\n## How do stablecoins compare to traditional payments on speed and settlement? \nStablecoins settle at internet speed. A transfer usually clears within seconds or minutes at any time of day, any day of the year. There are no cutoff times and no bank holidays. The payment is final once it\u2019s confirmed on the chain and it\u2019s irreversible like cash payment.\nTraditional systems are comparatively sluggish. Cards and take 1\u20133 business days. International wire transfers can take five days or more, especially if they route through multiple correspondent banks. Even a same-day domestic wire transfer is subject to bank cutoff times."

        "Stablecoins: An Alternative Payment Method for Merchants?\nA new wave of payment innovation is upon us, and it is fueled, at least in part, by digital-first consumers\u2019 and merchants\u2019 concerns about the rising costs of traditional payment methods. Stablecoins, which are digital assets capable of being redeemed for a fixed amount of monetary value, stand out as one such innovative payment method that reduces friction by allowing lower costs and faster settlement for merchants, all without the need to rely on traditional payment card networks. There\u2019s a rumor that several large merchants are exploring issuing their own stablecoins as an alternative payment method to reduce acceptance costs. And the [recently passed Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/insights/newsletters/2025/07/newsletters-practices-dcb-digital-currency-blockchain-q2-2025) provides a regulatory regime that could expand the adoption of stablecoins as alternative pay.",
        "A key driver to the adoption of stablecoins as an alternative payment is the elimination of the costs inherent in accepting traditional payment cards. Most merchants pay transaction and interchange fees \u2014 which may vary depending on the type of merchant, the type of transaction (e.g., card present or not present), and the card type \u2014 as a condition to acceptance of traditional payment cards (e.g., Amex, Mastercard, and Visa). Merchants\u2019 obligation to honor all cards, coupled with surcharging restrictions, have left merchants with little flexibility when it comes to acceptance costs, unless the merchant has a separate incentive arrangement with a card payment network to reduce acceptance costs. Because stablecoins operate on blockchain networks, direct transactions between a merchant and a customer can occur with minimal or no involvement from traditional financial institutions, which will eliminate the need for many acceptance fees and potentially introduce other inherent cost savings for merchants (e.g., reserve requirements and chargeback risks). \nBecause of their use of blockchain technology, stablecoins also significantly reduce settlement times associated with traditional payment rails by \n  * bypassing intermediaries in the clearing process, including many of the players in the current payment infrastructure (e.g., networks, issuing banks, acquiring banks, processors); \n  * offering 24-7 availability, reducing delays based on time zones, weekends, and holidays; and\n  * reducing reconciliation time due to the use of a public ledger.",
        "Stablecoins, therefore, satisfy the increasing demand for instant settlement, particularly in an increasingly global marketplace. \nEven with these benefits, however, the lack of a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins may impede wider adoption by merchants and consumers alike.\n## The Promise of the GENIUS Act\nThe GENIUS Act, which establishes the first federal regulatory framework specifically for the issuance and use of payment stablecoins, passed in the Senate and the House with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Trump on July 18, 2025. Among other requirements, the GENIUS Act requires issuers to provide a full reserve for dollar-backed stablecoins and to provide monthly public disclosures and audited financial statements. Stablecoin issuers will also be subject to the Bank Secrecy Act for anti-money laundering and related purposes and would be subject to oversight by federal or state regulators. \nThe passage of the GENIUS Act represents a significant step forward with the broader adoption of stablecoins, and blockchain more generally, across the payments space. Payment providers like PayPal and Stripe already support stablecoin transactions, and other platforms are expected to soon follow. And while merchants may be initially hesitant to embrace this alternative payment method, any up-front investment required to integrate this technology will be substantially outweighed by the benefits of stablecoins, which present the opportunity to improve both the customer experience and the merchant\u2019s bottom line.\nWe practice in every fintech vertical, including payments, deposits, lending, digital assets, and alternative finance. \n_This informational piece, which may be considered advertising under the ethical rules of certain jurisdictions, is provided on the understanding that it does not constitute the rendering of legal advice or other professional advice by Goodwin or its lawyers.

Even where banks, nonbanks, and state charters will be subject to equivalent stablecoin issuance regulatory regimes, banks and bank holding companies will be starting from a place of heightened regulatory restrictions \u2014 with supervision, capital, liquidity, management, activity, and affiliate transaction requirements that nonbanks do not have. Moreover, nonbank digital assets companies may have more experience and technical know-how in blockchain markets and applications that make them better suited to many roles within the payment stablecoin ecosystem. And, of course, banks, as depository institutions, may operate as service providers to payment stablecoin issuers, for example, as providers of deposit reserves and custody services, while developing other new services to, and partnerships with, digital asset companies and other nonbanks. Finally, it appears that agency rulemaking will play a significant role in the stablecoin regulatory landscape in the coming months and years, and we expect affected parties will seek to make their voices heard through rulemaking and congressional oversight.",
        "3.

        "Stablecoins present macro considerations as well. For one, their increased use in money laundering and terrorist financing poses risks to national security. In addition, increased holdings of stablecoins by the public could potentially draw down bank deposits and thereby limit the efficacy of monetary policy. On the other hand, if issuers hold cash reserves as deposits and steer new cash into banks, such as from unbanked or foreign populations, stablecoin uptake may increase deposits and enhance the transmission of monetary policy. The composition of reserves also has implications for public finance\u2014U.S. Treasury securities, not cash, [are currently the favored reserve asset](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2025/04/stablecoins-and-crypto-shocks-an-update/) of the largest stablecoin issuers, who are already as significant holders of Treasury bills as the largest U.S. money market funds. Continued stablecoin growth could therefore bolster demand for government debt, not to mention the global dominance of the dollar, which is overwhelmingly the peg of choice among tokens currently in circulation.\n## How are stablecoins regulated in the US?",
        "In July 2025, Congress passed the , which [establishes a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/stablecoins-issues-for-regulators-as-they-implement-genius-act/). Similar to the U.S.\u2019s dual banking system, stablecoin issuers may apply for approval from either federal or (if total issuance is below $10 billion) state regulators in states where such regulation exists. Issuers must back their stablecoins one-to-one with reserves of cash or other permitted assets\u2014such as Treasury securities, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, government money market funds, bank deposits, or tokenized versions of the same\u2014and must report monthly on the composition of their reserves. Issuers will also be subject to federal anti-money laundering regulations. Their stablecoins, which cannot pay interest, must be redeemable for a fixed monetary value. The law designates the Treasury\u2019s Comptroller of the Currency as the federal regulator for nonbank issuers, whereas bank subsidiaries that wish to issue stablecoins will be regulated by the applicable state or federal bank regulators. State and federal regulators have until July 2026 to finalize implementation rules, including stablecoins\u2019 tax characterization, standards for foreign stablecoins sold in the U.S., and policies regarding conflicts of interest for stablecoin issuers, an issue of public debate [given the Trump family\u2019s growing business in crypto assets](https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/09/02/trump-world-liberty-financial-crypto-blockchain-token-wealth-bitcoin/). The law does not cover what it terms \u201cnon-payment stablecoins,\u201d which include algorithmic stablecoins, and remain in the purview of state regulators.",
        "Previously, all stablecoins were regulated and supervised as money transmitters, primarily at the state level. Many state governments [have applied existing rules, and some have passed new laws](https://stevenscenter.wharton.upenn.edu/publications-50-state-review/), to subject issuers and exchangers of crypto assets to regulations for consumer protection and financial soundness. Money transmitters are required to register with the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which in 2013 clarified that reporting requirements for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) [apply equally to the transmission of crypto assets](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/guidance/application-fincens-regulations-persons-administering). Banks, for their part, needed special permission under Biden administration policies to custody crypto assets, hold reserves for stablecoin issuers as deposits, and participate in blockchains, but the Comptroller of the Currency [reversed this policy in March 2025](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-16.html).\nIn 2015, the New York Division of Financial Services\u2014an early mover on crypto regulation\u2014began requiring businesses engaged in any of several activities involving crypto assets to and comply with standards including capital requirements, AML programs, and consumer protection. New York first approved the issuance of stablecoins by licensees in 2018, and in 2022 [clarified that licensees issuing U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins must hold full reserves](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20220608_issuance_stablecoins) of highly safe and liquid assets, publish monthly attestations of reserve adequacy by independent accountants, and redeem stablecoins for reserves in a timely fashion under clearly disclosed policies."

All issuers fall under the Bank Secrecy Act, making AML/CFT and sanctions compliance non-negotiable.\n  * Payment stablecoins are carved out from securities and commodities law, removing them from SEC and CFTC jurisdiction and squarely placing oversight with banking regulators.",
        "The impact on the market has been immediate Coinbase, Circle, and other US-linked issuers are seen as compliance winners, while offshore or under-collateralised tokens face significant pressure. There is reason to think the Treasury could benefit too: mandatory T-bill reserves mean stablecoin issuers may become major buyers of government debt, reinforcing dollar demand globally. Critics, however, warn of financial-stability spillovers \u2014 if redemptions force mass Treasury sales, yields could spike.\nThe EU introduced its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) in 2024. It sets out a licensing regime for issuers of \u201casset-referenced tokens\u201d and \u201ce-money tokens\u201d, with strict requirements on capital, governance, and reserve management. MiCA also allows regulators to restrict non-euro stablecoins if their use exceeds 1 million transactions and EUR 200 million per day, a safeguard aimed at protecting monetary sovereignty. While the regime creates compliance costs, it also offers legal certainty, potentially boosting adoption among institutional users. For global issuers, however, the euro-centric design presents strategic challenges.\n## United Kingdom: Integrating into FSMA\nThe UK is in the process of bringing stablecoins under existing payments and e-money legislation via amendments to the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA), with draft rules under consultation. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will oversee compliance, while the Bank of England will supervise systemic stablecoins. The Treasury has made clear that privately issued stablecoins can play a role in payments, provided they meet operational resilience and redemption standards. This pragmatic approach aligns with the UK\u2019s ambition to be a digital finance hub, but details of secondary legislation and supervisory intensity remain to be tested.",
        "These themes reflect regulators\u2019 balancing act: encouraging innovation while safeguarding monetary stability.\nStablecoins remain a small section of the wider cryptocurrency market, but recent regulatory developments give reason to think their share may grow. Whilst cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are speculative assets, stablecoins\u2019 reduced volatility makes them more viable as a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account.\nNew rules generally raise barriers to entry. Smaller issuers may exit or partner with regulated institutions, while larger players with balance-sheet capacity consolidate market share. This mirrors patterns seen in e-money and payments regulation over the past decade.\nBanks and established PSPs are entering the stablecoin arena, either by issuing tokens directly or by providing custody and reserve services. This could erode the first-mover advantage of crypto-native firms and tilt the market towards regulated incumbents.\nMiCA\u2019s daily transaction cap on non-euro stablecoins could limit the use of USD-backed coins in Europe, potentially fragmenting money flow. Conversely, the clarity provided by the framework may encourage the development of euro-denominated alternatives. With the GENIUS Act, the US has removed much of the regulatory uncertainty that previously pushed innovation abroad. While smaller issuers may still find compliance burdens heavy, larger players now have a clearer pathway to operate domestically.\nThe lack of harmonisation complicates cross-border payments. A stablecoin fully compliant in Singapore may fall foul of MiCA caps or US banking rules. For multinational PSPs, this means higher legal complexity, compliance costs, and operational risk."

Stablecoins have also long been a lynchpin of cryptocurrency transactions, allowing users to move relatively easily from cryptocurrency to \u201cfiat\u201d through a stablecoin and then back into a different cryptocurrency.\nUse of stablecoins in connection with cryptocurrency transactions has been highly successful. In 2024, total stablecoin transfer volume was US$27.6 trillion, almost all of it used for digital asset transactions, and its market capitalization grew to US$150 billion. However, adoption of these digital assets for cross-border transactions or for retail payments has been slow, due in large part to uncertainty as to how stablecoins would be regulated. Recently, however, the regulatory landscape has become much clearer, particularly in the United States, paving the way for widespread adoption of stablecoins. In this chapter, we provide some background on stablecoins, and then an analysis of the current state of stablecoin regulation in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and Hong Kong.",
        "Federal regulators (the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, and the National Credit Union Administration) oversee PPSIs depending on the type of entity. The law also provides for recognition of foreign-issued stablecoins if they are subject to regulatory and supervisory requirements that are \u201ccomparable\u201d to those applicable to PPSIs, as determined by the Treasury Secretary upon a recommendation from each other member of the SCRC.\nSignificantly, if a payment stablecoin is not issued by a PPSI, then it cannot be: (i) treated as cash or cash equivalent for accounting purposes; (ii) eligible as cash or cash equivalent margin or collateral for broker-dealers, swap dealers, and certain other intermediaries; or (iii) accepted as a settlement asset to facilitate wholesale payments between banking organizations.\nUnder the GENIUS Act, so-called \u201cdigital asset service providers\u201d (, digital asset intermediaries, exchanges and custodians) will be generally prohibited from offering or selling payment stablecoins that are not issued by a PPSI beginning on July 18, 2028. In addition, they are prohibited from offering, selling or otherwise making available a payment stablecoin issued by a foreign stablecoin issuer unless such issuer has the technological capability to comply, and will comply, with the terms of any lawful order to seize, freeze, burn, or prevent the transfer of outstanding stablecoins, among other requirements.\n### Principal requirements for licensed stablecoin issuers\nThe GENIUS Act sets forth a number compliance and other requirements for stablecoin issuers. These requirements will be central to the evaluation of license applications.\n#### _Reserve, redemption, and disclosure requirements_"

U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins (backed by reserve assets and not an algorithm) reached more than $260 billion in the third quarter of 2025, with Tether\u2019s USDT accounting for more than one half of the total, and Circle\u2019s USDC showing the fastest growth since the end of 2020. In addition, monthly transactions have risen to more than $1 trillion, about 10 times the volume at year-end 2020. While stablecoins can reduce the costs of cross-border remittances and multinational corporate cash management, this type of activity appears to still be limited.",

The law says that payment stablecoin issuers can be nonbank entities (federal or state qualified) or subsidiaries of insured depository institutions (IDIs). Issuers\u2019 activities are restricted to offering and redeeming stablecoins and ancillary activities. \nThis article highlights four key issues for regulators as they implement the GENIUS Act :\n, financial regulators need to write capital, liquidity, and risk management requirements for issuers within 18 months to ensure stable value, and to protect financial stability and the singleness of money (to the maximum extent possible without central bank settlement)."

Binance Holdings Ltd., No. 1:23-cv-01599 (D.D.C. June 28, 2024), ECF No. 248.\nSignificant variation exists in state-level regulation of stablecoins. Across the country, money transmission laws apply to stablecoin-related activities. However, some states, such as New York, offer specific guidance or entire regulatory regimes tailored for stablecoins. New York pioneered the BitLicense in 2015, which operates as a license and charter-based system for digital assets. \nSuch a license is required to conduct a digital asset business in New York. In June 2022, New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) released guidance on issuing U.S. dollar\u2013backed stablecoins. \nIndustry Guidance, Adrienne A. Harris, Superintendent of Fin. Servs., N.Y. Dep\u2019t of Fin. Servs., [Guidance on the Issuance of U.S. Dollar\u2013Backed Stablecoins](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20220608_issuance_stablecoins) (June 8, 2022).\nThe guidance applies to U.S. dollar\u2013backed stablecoin issuers licensed under a BitLicense or chartered as limited-purpose trust companies under New York banking law. The guidance creates \u201crecommendations or principles\u201d related to redeemability, reserves, and attestation (confirmation of accounting statements). Stablecoin issuers must hold at least a 1:1 ratio of reserves segregated from other assets, and the reserves must be highly liquid.",
        "The reserves are subject to NYDFS approval and may only be comprised of \u201cU.S. Treasury bills acquired by the Issuer three months or less from their respective maturities\u201d; \u201cReverse repurchase agreements fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes, and/or U.S. Treasury bonds on an overnight basis\u201d; \u201cGovernment money-market funds\u201d; or \u201cDeposit accounts at U.S. state or federally chartered depository institutions.\u201d Issuers must adopt clear redemption policies that allow for timely redemption (not more than two full business days) at par value. Moreover, stablecoin issuers must release public attestations monthly that a third-party accountant verifies. NYDFS issued these requirements as guidance, not rules. However, the guidance states that \u201c[i]ssuers that currently issue U.S. dollar\u2013backed stablecoins under DFS supervision are expected to come into compliance with this Guidance within three months of the date hereof.\u201d \nAlthough there are many differences in jurisdictional approaches to stablecoin regulation, some common regulatory principles emerge:\n  1. Stablecoin issuances require explicit regulatory approval by the appropriate regulator.\n  2. Reserves must be liquid and stable, ensuring that they can cover all issued stablecoins on a 1:1 basis.\n  3. Stablecoin payment services must align with existing financial regulations, offering protections akin to traditional currency-based payment systems. \nCryptocurrency companies in the U.S. are already subject to all state-based money-service business laws and must register as a money services business (MSB) in any state in which they operate.",

Many stablecoins have experienced market price fluctuation.\n  * Some foreign jurisdictions have passed laws regulating stablecoins. The EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) categorizes stablecoins into electronic money tokens (EMTs) and asset-referenced tokens (ARTs). The UK framework categorizes stablecoin payments as hybrid or pure.\n  * The U.S. lacks comprehensive federal legislation, but certain existing regulations apply. Significant variation exists in state-level regulation of stablecoins. New York pioneered the BitLicense in 2015, which operates as a license and charter-based system for digital assets.\n  * Common principles include the following: stablecoin issuances require explicit regulatory approval; reserves must be liquid and stable, ensuring that they can cover all issued stablecoins on a 1:1 basis; and stablecoin payment services must align with existing financial regulations."

Switzerland maintains a guidance-based approach offering flexibility but less legal certainty.\nThe GENIUS Act\u2019s comparable regime provisions may open opportunities for regulatory reciprocity, particularly with jurisdictions adopting similar prudential standards. However, initial determinations will likely prove restrictive given the unanimous approval requirement and high U.S. standards.\nSection 15 of the GENIUS Act further directs the Federal Reserve and Treasury to pursue reciprocal agreements with foreign jurisdictions, indicating congressional intent to eventually harmonize global stablecoin standards beyond the narrow comparable regime framework.\n## Other Key Takeaways for Market Participants\nExisting Stablecoin Issuers should immediately assess their path to compliance, determining whether federal or state licensing best suits their business model. Reserve portfolios require realignment to permitted assets, and operational infrastructure needs significant enhancement to meet disclosure and technical requirements.\nFinancial Institutions should evaluate opportunities in stablecoin issuance, leveraging existing regulatory relationships and infrastructure advantages. Banks may also benefit from providing custody services for reserves and stablecoins, subject to appropriate risk management."

        "# How to Build a Compliant Stablecoin Infrastructure for Enterprise Use\nBuilding a compliant stablecoin infrastructure is essential for enterprises exploring blockchain payments. Stablecoins offer speed, transparency and 24/7 settlement, but they also come with regulatory requirements and operational risks. Industry leaders embed compliance from day one integrating KYC/AML checks, travel-rule data sharing, and transaction monitoring directly into their payment stacks.\nIn practice, \u201cstablecoin compliance\u201d means meeting the same regulatory standards as traditional finance: rigorous identity verification, on-chain transaction scrutiny, and adherence to global laws. By prioritizing compliance early, businesses earn the trust of banks and regulators and unlock the full potential of blockchain-based enterprise payments.\nBuilding trust with stablecoins requires addressing several core requirements:\n  * \u2014 Verified onboarding of wallet users. Enterprises must use robust identity checks (government IDs, biometrics, proof-of-address) and link those credentials to blockchain addresses. Some solutions now offer \u201con-chain KYC,\u201d where cryptographic attestations of a user\u2019s verified identity are anchored on-chain without exposing personal data. This lets compliant users transact permissionlessly while signaling their KYC status to smart contracts. As Fireblocks notes, firms should implement workflows that \u201cverify identities through documentation and biometrics\u201d and perform dynamic risk assessments (behavioral analysis, device fingerprinting, geolocation checks) during onboarding.",
        "Secure custody builds confidence with regulators and partners. It also safeguards the business itself: as McKinsey notes, losing keys or reserve control can undermine the entire stablecoin project, even if the blockchain protocol is sound.\n## Smart Contracts, APIs and Integration\nA compliant stablecoin infrastructure also relies on . Smart contracts must be securely written and audited, and enterprise systems (bank ledgers, ERP, CRM) need API connectivity to the crypto rails.\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n_Diagram of enterprise smart contract architecture showing modular compliance hooks and API integration with payment systems (Source: Kaleido)_\n  * Every token contract or payment contract should undergo a rigorous security review before deployment. Auditors can verify that the contract has no logic errors and properly incorporates compliance checks. For example, a contract might include functions or modifiers that automatically block transfers involving non-verified addresses or blacklisted wallets. Embedding such checks at the code level can a transaction at the moment it violates policy.\n  * Architect the system so that KYC/AML components are modular and pluggable. For instance, a payment API might call out to an external compliance engine before executing any transaction. This way, updates to global sanctions lists or local regulations can be integrated without redesigning the whole system.\n  * Use APIs and middleware to connect stablecoins with existing corporate treasury and payment systems. An enterprise-ready ledger should translate stablecoin transactions into the company\u2019s accounting system, update accounts payable/receivable, and trigger corporate controls (just like a SWIFT message would). This ensures stablecoins become a first-class asset in the enterprise finance stack."

        "The smart contract architecture of stablecoins extends beyond basic token functionality to include specialized features required for stability maintenance and regulatory compliance. Advanced stablecoin implementations incorporate features such as pause functionality for emergency situations, blacklist capabilities for regulatory compliance and upgrade \nmechanisms that allow issuers to modify contract behavior while maintaining token continuity. \nMulti-signature controls represent critical security features in stablecoin smart contracts, requiring multiple authorized parties to approve significant actions such as token minting, contract upgrades or emergency pauses. These controls help prevent single points of failure and provide additional security layers that are particularly important for institutional adoption and regulatory compliance. \nThe transparency characteristics of blockchain technology create both opportunities and challenges for stablecoin operations. While all transactions are publicly visible and verifiable, providing unprecedented transparency into stablecoin flows and usage patterns, this visibility also creates privacy considerations for institutional users if the transactions are on public blockchains, as opposed to private blockchains, and potential compliance challenges in jurisdictions with strict financial privacy requirements. \nThe multi-chain nature of modern blockchain infrastructure has led to the deployment of major stablecoins across multiple networks, each with distinct technical characteristics and trade-offs. for example, operates on over ten different blockchain networks including Ethereum, Tron, Polygon and Avalanche, with each deployment requiring separate technical integration and risk assessment [12].",
        "Cross-chain bridge technology enables the transfer of stablecoins between different blockchain networks, but these bridges represent additional technical and security risks that must be evaluated in institutional risk management frameworks. Bridge exploits have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, highlighting the importance of understanding cross-chain risks when evaluating multi-chain stablecoin strategies. In addition, the interoperability of the cryptoasset ecosystem means that bridge functionality allows bad actors to use this feature to obfuscate stablecoin transactions before it is off-ramped to fiat.\nThe governance structures of stablecoin protocols determine how technical parameters are adjusted, upgrades are implemented and emergency responses are coordinated. These governance mechanisms represent critical components of stablecoin systems that directly impact their long-term stability and adaptability to changing market conditions. \nDecentralized governance through token voting enables community control over protocol parameters but may also introduce decision-making delays and coordination challenges during crisis situations. The balance between decentralization and operational efficiency represents an ongoing challenge for stablecoin protocol design and a key consideration for institutional evaluation. \nEmergency response mechanisms, including pause functionality and emergency governance procedures, provide critical safeguards for stablecoin systems during extreme market conditions or security incidents. Understanding these mechanisms and their activation procedures is essential for institutional risk management and contingency planning."

For more recent commentary by Nellie Liang, read \nStablecoins continue to grow, and use cases are increasing. The vast majority are tied to the U.S. dollar, but the U.S. lacks a strong, consistent, and coherent regulatory framework. I describe below some essential features of a regulatory framework for the U.S. that would both support financial innovation and reduce serious risks, many of which were highlighted in in 2021 by the President\u2019s Working Group. Current financial regulations, mainly a diverse set of state money transmitter licensing requirements, are inadequate for significant stablecoins that operate across state and national borders, raise new and unique illicit finance risks, and threaten monetary and financial stability.\nStablecoins function as \u201cdigital cash\u201d issued by a private firm that is recorded and transferred on a blockchain rather than on the books and records of a commercial bank or central bank. The market value of stablecoins has grown from less than $20 billion in 2019 to more than $230 billion on a global basis in early 2025. Stablecoins currently are used mainly for trading crypto assets, although there is growing use of USD-based stablecoins in countries with less stable domestic currencies. Evidence points to increased use for terrorist financing and money laundering.",
        "to increase competition and efficiency of payments and capital markets activities as well as to support the global role of the dollar and U.S. national security. Stablecoins could make payments more efficient and available in real time as consumers increasingly demand faster, cheaper payments and businesses aim for efficiencies. For instance, blockchain rails could increase efficiency and innovation in cross-border payments and corporate treasury management as well as in merchant payments. The upside is greater if tokenization of securities becomes more widespread, since stablecoins would be a natural means of payment for securities transactions that are executed on-chain.\nBut stablecoins come with risks. From a financial stability perspective, they could be subject to runs if their value is not truly stable, and they could undermine the safety of payments if their operations are not robust to a range of operational and cyber threats. And their potential to scale rapidly because of network effects could increase risks to credit intermediation and monetary policy transmission if insured depository institutions lose significant deposits to stablecoins, or could lead to excessive concentration of power if stablecoins are issued by commercial firms. In addition, stablecoins present new and significant illicit financing risks since values can be transferred quickly across borders if actors are able to exploit weaknesses in international anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards. \nTo address the risks that stablecoins pose, a regulatory framework should include seven essential features:",
        "1. Reserve assets of a stablecoin issuer need to be ultra-safe and liquid if stablecoins are to function as money issued by a private firm. Because stablecoins do not have deposit insurance or access to a lender of last resort, they need to be backed by safe and liquid assets, like cash, Treasury bills, and central bank reserves, so they can offer convertibility at par. If assets with either credit or counterparty risk were to be permitted, the stablecoin issuer should be required to hold more capital and liquidity for those risks. Private money backed by risky assets with inadequate capital would be vulnerable to destabilizing runs and lose its ability to function as a medium of exchange.\n  2. Stablecoin issuers\u2019 activities should be limited to issuance and redemption (and ancillary activities), and issuers that achieve significant size should be subject to prudential federal regulations for capital, liquidity, and risk management calibrated to its limited activities. An issuer also should be subject to strong operational standards to ensure payment finality and reliability and its resilience to crypto, cyber, and other threats. In addition, stablecoin issuers should be subject to consumer protection rules that apply to similar payment products and services. At a minimum, the qualifications and integrity of an applicant should be considered when financial regulators consider granting a charter, either for a nonbank or a subsidiary of a depository institution.\n  3. Reserve assets of a stablecoin should be segregated and prioritized in bankruptcy, so that holders can still access their payment stablecoins if a stablecoin issuer were to fail. Clear rights to immediate redemption are needed for stablecoins of a failing issuer to prevent payment disruptions even as the issuer\u2019s liabilities are settled in bankruptcy over a longer period."

        "## What\u2019s in the Proposed Legislation\nTwo bills currently under review in Congress are pushing stablecoins forward. The GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act aim to establish a regulatory foundation for stablecoins used across government and commercial sectors.\nHere is what they include:\n  * Licensing requirements for stablecoin issuers\n  * 1:1 reserve mandates with assets such as U.S. dollars or Treasury bills\n  * Monthly public audits conducted by third parties\n  * A ban on algorithmic stablecoins that are not asset-backed\n  * Oversight from federal agencies like the Federal Reserve or OCC, depending on issuer size\n\nTogether, these bills are designed to bring stability, transparency, and regulatory clarity to stablecoins used in serious financial infrastructure.\n\n## Why This Matters for Contractors\nStablecoins are not just faster than wire transfers. They could reshape how the government pays contractors. If adopted, these tools could be used to:\n  * Deliver real-time payments to vendors and subrecipients\n  * Cut foreign exchange costs for international projects\n  * Speed up disbursements for grants or disaster relief\n  * Maintain transparent, traceable records that meet audit requirements\n\nThis shift also helps preserve the dollar\u2019s global standing. By backing stablecoins with U.S. assets, the government increases global demand for Treasuries and reinforces dollar dominance."

        "## How Payment Firms and Institutions Embed Stablecoins\nIntegrating stablecoins into a payments stack requires more than just adding a token, it means engaging with the underlying systems that make secure, compliant, and scalable digital asset operations possible. For firms building stablecoin-powered flows, success depends on a coordinated of custody, network access, APIs, and reconciliation systems.\nNot every institution begins with full-stack . Many start by partnering with third parties to access the rails. But over time, as internal expertise and regulatory clarity grow, firms move toward more direct control of custody, execution, and treasury. This transition, from C, is increasingly measured in months, not years.\nPlatforms that anticipate this journey, and architect for it early, gain the speed, margin, and resilience advantages that come from owning the payment flow.Here are four foundational components:\n### 1. Custody and Wallet Infrastructure\nStablecoins need to be securely held before they can move. Most payment firms implement either custodial or self-custodial wallet models, depending on their regulatory posture, internal expertise, and desired control.\n  * rely on regulated third parties to store assets and manage private keys.\n  * offers greater control but also requires robust key management, policy enforcement, and operational safeguards.\n\n  * Segregated wallets for clients or use cases\n  * Granular access control to mitigate operational risk\n  * Pre-transaction simulation and approval workflows\n  * Compatibility with internal ledgering and treasury systems",
        "Wallet orchestration is also essential, especially for platforms managing both corporate treasury and end-user balances within the same environment.\nStablecoin transactions settle on blockchain networks, each with distinct trade-offs in speed, cost, and ecosystem compatibility.\n  * \u2013 well-supported, highly secure, but relatively expensive\n  * , , \u2013 cost-effective and fast, often favored in emerging markets\n  * , , \u2013 optimized for specific geographies or use cases\n\n  * (signing, gas fees, execution)\n  * , as stablecoins often exist across multiple networks\n  * Interoperability tools to reduce fragmentation and support \n\nFirms often select multiple blockchains to balance reliability with regional cost-efficiency and latency needs.\n### 3. APIs for Checkout and Settlement\nTo make stablecoins usable at scale, they must plug directly into familiar payment and treasury workflows. This is typically done through APIs that abstract blockchain complexity and connect on-chain assets with front-end interfaces or back-office systems.\n  * Real-time merchant settlement or mass payouts\n  * Internal disbursements (e.g., payroll, affiliate commissions)\n\n  * Integrated conversion (e.g., auto-swap to fiat)\n  * Regulatory and KYC/KYB workflows behind the scenes\n\nSome firms embed these APIs into proprietary platforms; others rely on third-party orchestration to simplify implementation and compliance.\n### 4. Multi-Stablecoin Support, FX Management, and Reconciliation\nThe proliferation of fiat-backed stablecoins, USDC, PYUSD, EURC, FDUSD, and others, means payment platforms must manage multiple currencies and conversion pathways.\n  * Support for stablecoin-to-stablecoin and fiat-to-stablecoin FX\n  * Dynamic pricing and routing tools to optimize costs across venues and partners\n  * Automated reconciliation tools that map on-chain flows to internal ledgers or ERP systems",
        "Leading platforms integrate these capabilities with:\n  * Policy controls for approved currencies and corridors\n  * Reporting systems for audit and compliance needs\n  * Real-time visibility into wallet-level balances and flows\n\n## Risks and Challenges of Integrating Stablecoins into Payment Infrastructure\nWhile stablecoins offer speed, transparency, and programmable features that make them an attractive addition to modern payment systems, their integration introduces several structural and operational challenges. For payment firms and institutions, understanding and addressing these risks is essential to unlocking the full benefits of stablecoin-based payments.\n### 1. Regulatory Compliance and AML Requirements\nStablecoins exist at the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology, creating complexities for teams. Anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CTF), Know Your Customer (KYC), and Travel Rule requirements apply, but their enforcement varies widely across jurisdictions.\n  * Unlike centralized financial rails, blockchain-based stablecoin transactions are typically pseudonymous and irreversible, complicating regulatory enforcement.\n  * Firms must implement robust KYC/KYB procedures, monitor wallet activity in real time, and ensure compliance with global sanctions frameworks such as OFAC.\n  * Key vulnerabilities include on/off-ramps, unhosted wallets, and jurisdictional mismatches, which often fall into regulatory gray areas.\n  * Many regulators have responded with frameworks requiring enhanced due diligence, user verification, and pre-transaction compliance checks.\n  * The new FATF Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to collect and disclose specific customer data when transacting digital assets over a particular value threshold. Global jurisdictions currently have different disclosure and threshold requirements with varied enforcement."

For example, the Worldpay stablecoin pilot signaled a major step toward mainstream adoption, demonstrating how established payment giants are exploring digital assets. \nIn 2025, several notable stablecoin launches further underscored this trend. Visa announced a stablecoin prefunding pilot through Visa Direct at SIBOS 2025, aimed at enabling faster business transactions. Tether unveiled USAT, a U.S.-based stablecoin designed to strengthen its presence in the U.S. market. Additionally, nine major European banks, including ING and UniCredit, have collaborated to explore or issue a new stablecoin, showcasing the growing interest from traditional financial institutions..\n## The Infrastructure Layer: What It Takes to Support Stablecoin Payments\nMaking stablecoin payments work for e-commerce requires more than just a blockchain. It needs a sophisticated technology stack that connects digital assets to the traditional financial world in a secure and compliant way.\nSeveral components are essential for building a robust system for stablecoin payments:\n  * Businesses need a safe place to hold their digital assets. must include enterprise-grade custody solutions, like multi-party computation (MPC) wallets, which protect funds from theft and unauthorized access. The settlement layer ensures that transactions are cleared and finalized reliably.\n  * For merchants to accept stablecoins, they need easy-to-integrate tools. Payment gateways and APIs act as the bridge, allowing e-commerce platforms to connect to blockchain networks without needing to build complex systems from scratch.\n  * To operate legally, payment providers must adhere to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. The best infrastructure for stablecoin payments integrates these compliance checks directly into the transaction flow, ensuring every payment is screened."

In this case, you connect straight to blockchain network(s) in bypass of intermediaries.\nEffectively, you build your own wallet infrastructure and plug into the network. From the user\u2019s perspective, it looks just like depositing or withdrawing fiat. But behind the scenes, the platform is orchestrating on-chain transfers in real time.\nBecause this is a direct connection, you\u2019ll have to handle custody\u2014hot wallets for day-to-day flows and cold storage for reserves. Our team has recently helped a implement an effective treasury management mechanism for maintaining appropriate liquidity levels of stablecoin and cryptocurrencies traded on the platform. It allows them to on/off-ramp crypto, enforce security, and automate transfer policies between different wallets.\nCompliance also sits squarely on your side. Every inbound and outbound transfer should be screened against sanctions lists and blockchain analytics tools to prevent illicit flows. One way to do this is via smart contracts.Most centralized stablecoins have embedded logic for on-chain checks. You can program automatic sender/receiver blacklist checks or a command to add or remove addresses from the blacklist based on the off-chain screening you do (e.g., as part of your general KYC/KYB process). Some stablecoins\u2014USDT, USDC, and BUSD\u2014also give functionality to destroy or seize tokens from blacklisted addresses.",

High engineering complexity, regulatory exposure, and operational risk. You\u2019ll have to:",
        "This wave of favorable stablecoin regulations gives institutions the clarity they need to move from pilots to full-scale stablecoin adoption.\n## Stablecoins step in where banks fall short\nStablecoins fill in the gaps long overlooked by global banking systems: middlemen who used to manage local partnerships, fraud, and operations. They were necessary in the early days, but have become increasingly cumbersome (and to an extent unnecessary) in the digital finance age.\nStablecoin payments flow over blockchains, which are credibly neutral, auditable, composable, and designed to scale globally. Meaning you can keep full audit trails and add custom controls to prevent fraud or KYC\u2014all while benefiting from an already existing and widely adopted technology, linking people everywhere, just like an email.\nFor individuals, it means accessible, instant, and transparent money movement. For businesses, that translates into better cash flow predictability, smoother working capital management, and far fewer reconciliation headaches.\nAnd this opens up a new pane of use cases.\nThe global remittances stood at last year, with one billion people using some money transfer service.

        "report": "**Report: Should the United States Adopt Stablecoin as an Official Digital Currency?**\n\n---\n\n### **1. Introduction**\n\nStablecoins are digital currencies pegged to stable assets such as the U.S. dollar or Treasury securities. Adopting a stablecoin as an **official U.S. digital currency** would mark a major transformation in how money circulates, how the Federal Reserve implements policy, and how payments are processed nationwide. Evaluating this decision demands a balanced understanding of three interrelated domains: **economic implications**, **regulatory and policy frameworks**, and **technological feasibility**. Each carries opportunities for innovation and risk\u2014particularly when integrating blockchain features with a deeply interconnected financial system.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Economic Implications**  \n(From Child 1)\n\nEconomically, an official U.S. stablecoin could **increase efficiency and inclusivity** within the financial system. It would allow **instant settlement and lower transaction costs** by removing intermediaries, potentially accelerating domestic and international payments [1][2][3]. Transparency through blockchain could enhance auditability and reduce reconciliation errors, while programmable \u201csmart contracts\u201d could automate transactions and reduce administrative overhead [1][3][4].  \n\nHowever, the economic transformation would not be without risk. Stablecoin integration could **disrupt liquidity management** in money and Treasury markets, especially if large redemptions triggered instability or forced asset sales [3][4]. The **Federal Reserve\u2019s traditional tools** for controlling liquidity and interest rates might become more complex to deploy in a tokenized environment [1]. Furthermore, as global adoption grows, a U.S. stablecoin might **reinforce dollar dominance** internationally while provoking foreign policy tension around monetary sovereignty [5]. Economically, the benefits hinge on stability and careful oversight: while inclusive and efficient, the system could magnify volatility if poorly designed or governed.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Regulatory and Policy Framework**  \n(From Child 2)\n\nFrom a regulatory standpoint, the U.S. currently faces a **fragmented and overlapping structure** involving the Federal Reserve, Treasury, OCC, FDIC, FinCEN, and various state agencies [1][2][3][4]. This dual federal/state system leads to inconsistency in compliance standards, reserve requirements, and redemption policies. Proposed reforms, such as those under the GENIUS Act, aim to define \u201cpayment stablecoins\u201d as a new category of instrument separate from securities and commodities, thereby consolidating jurisdiction under banking regulators [3].  \n\nComparatively, other jurisdictions like the **EU (MiCA framework)** and **Japan\u2019s Payment Services Law** have implemented clearer, more centralized systems mandating full reserve backing, redemption guarantees, and single-agency oversight [1][2][6]. For the U.S. to follow suit, it would need to **harmonize regulatory oversight**, establish a **unified federal charter** for issuers under the OCC, and guarantee **1:1 reserves with transparent attestation** practices [1][2][6]. Moreover, **cross-border regulatory harmonization** would be critical to avoid arbitrage and to strengthen global interoperability. In short, without substantial reform, the regulatory terrain remains the largest barrier to stablecoin adoption in the U.S.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Technological and Infrastructure Feasibility**  \n(From Child 3)\n\nTechnologically, adopting a national stablecoin is **feasible, but infrastructure dependent**. The core technologies exist: secure multiparty computation (MPC) wallets, real-time reserve monitoring, audited smart contracts, and API-based integration for automated compliance [Child 1]. The infrastructure can support **cross-border interoperability**, **programmable compliance enforcement**, and **real-time transaction screening**, all critical for a regulated digital currency system.  \n\nHowever, integration with **existing banking infrastructures** poses challenges. While APIs could link blockchain systems to bank payment networks, large-scale adoption would require modernization of legacy systems and uniform cryptographic identity standards [Child 2]. Additionally, cybersecurity, privacy preservation, and consistent compliance monitoring are essential to maintain public confidence and resilience. Thus, stablecoin deployment is technologically achievable, but would require phased rollouts and upgrades across public and private channels [Child 1][Child 2].\n\n---\n\n### **5. Synthesis and Evaluation**\n\nTaken together, the findings across the three analyses show interdependent trade-offs. Economically, a stablecoin could **enhance payment efficiency and inclusion** [Child 1]; yet, **fragmented regulation** threatens to offset these gains unless a unified framework is adopted [Child 2]. Technologically, the foundations for secure and interoperable systems exist but demand modernization and policy coordination [Child 3].  \n\nIn practice, **regulatory clarity and institutional reform** would catalyze private-sector investment and infrastructure upgrades, improving both technical and economic readiness. Conversely, premature adoption\u2014before harmonized reserve requirements, AML/KYC interoperability, and monetary policy safeguards\u2014could amplify financial risks and compromise stability.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the integrated evidence, the United States **should not immediately adopt stablecoin as an official digital currency**, but should **progressively develop and pilot** such a system under unified regulatory oversight.  \n\n- Economically, adoption promises clear gains in efficiency and inclusion, but also systemic risks to liquidity management and monetary control [Child 1].  \n- Regulatively, the U.S. must first establish consistent federal authority, standardized reserve frameworks, and international coordination, following the models of the EU and Japan [Child 2].  \n- Technologically, stablecoin deployment is feasible but contingent on infrastructure modernization and cybersecurity assurance [Child 3].  \n\nA staged, regulated approach\u2014beginning with limited federal pilots, robust supervisory reforms, and infrastructure upgrades\u2014would position the U.S. to realize the benefits of stablecoin innovation while managing associated risks.  \n\n**Recommendation:** Pursue a **phased adoption strategy**, focused first on building a consistent policy and technological foundation before full-scale implementation as the nation\u2019s official digital currency.\n\n---\n\n**Citations:** [1][2][3][4][5][6], [Child 1][Child 2]",

              "Stablecoins offer users several advantages. For starters, they are designed to maintain a stable value, making them less volatile than other cryptocurrencies. They are also programmable, which means they can be automatically managed and controlled. This makes them a relatively reliable medium of exchange within the blockchain universe.\n\u201cStablecoins are a digital, on-chain form of fiat money. They are easy to self-custody and transact, and they are also fast, particularly in the context of cross-border money movement. One could even consider them a better form than fiat, as they can move quicker and less expensively across existing financial infrastructure in certain circumstances,\u201d Worthington said. As such, they are well-suited for the traditional financial services system, where the movement of cash needs to keep pace with transactions that are increasingly executed outside of usual business hours.\nOn the flip side, stablecoins could pose a threat to financial stability. For instance, stablecoins could have significant run risks, in which a large group of investors redeem their holdings simultaneously. \u201cThe collapse of TerraUSD in May 2022 highlights just how quickly a run can occur, in an asset class that trades 24/7,\u201d Ho remarked. The effects of a massive liquidation could spill over to other markets, destabilizing the traditional banking system.\nIn addition, the [Bank for International Settlements (BIS)](https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2025e3.htm) posits that stablecoins fall short on three key tests for money:\n  * Stablecoins that are traded in secondary markets might be exchanged at a slight deviation from par with the fiat currency they are pegged to.\n  * The issuer\u2019s balance sheet cannot be expanded at will, and any additional supply of stablecoins would require full upfront payment by its holders.",
              "In addition, the bill establishes strict reserve requirements, mandating that each stablecoin be backed one-to-one with U.S. dollars, short-term Treasuries and other high-quality assets. However, it is unclear whether non-bank stablecoin issuers will have access to the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, which is critical when it comes to addressing run risks.\n\u201cClearly, these developments are still very much in their nascent phase. But one thing is for certain \u2014 there is more to come as the industry continues to explore product innovation to integrate stablecoins into the traditional financial system,\u201d Ho said. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early to know how this will play out, but it could potentially challenge how we think about liquidity in the money markets over the longer term.\u201d \nListen to our latest episode from Making Sense: How stablecoins are reshaping global finance\nIn this episode, Kenneth Worthington, a Brokers, Asset Managers and Exchanges equity analyst at J.P. Morgan, is joined by Teresa Ho, head of U.S. Short Duration Strategy, to explore the dynamic world of stablecoins. Together, they break down what stablecoins are, how they work and why they\u2019re gaining so much attention in today\u2019s financial landscape. The discussion covers how stablecoins differ from deposits and money market funds, the impact of recent legislation such as the GENIUS Act, as well as what all this could mean for the future of finance."

However, this overlooks serious risks to the foreign country. Unintended dollarization, or more generally, currency substitution, by reducing the effectiveness of its monetary policy for managing business cycles. Namely, the local central bank would normally be able to manage the cost and value of its currency as one tool to provide relief in recession. This is less effective when households and firms hold less of this currency.The use of stablecoins today sanctions should also be noted. Tether\u2019s USD stablecoin, for instance, has enabled billions of dollars in sanctions evasion globally.Because of the risks of illegal activity, including the evasion of sanctions and other measures, currency substitution, and other challenges, authorities abroad may take measures to limit stablecoin usage in foreign currency in their jurisdictions.

There\u2019s some disintermediation in the sense of the shift in the curve of total demand for Treasury assets.\nWhile short-term repos against long-term Treasuries likely don\u2019t transfer much of the duration risk of long-term Treasuries to the stablecoin, some of it could remain\u2014such as when 30-year bond prices fell by \u22488% in a week in March 2020 (particularly if stablecoin disclosure requirements are such that markets can see the collateral exposure).\nThe greater financial stability risk here is tying the supply of funding in money markets to crypto market cap. When cryptoasset market cap goes up, the supply of stablecoins needs to grow\u2014and vice versa.\nThat means that when crypto assets fall, money market funding is . This is likely manageable in \u201cnormal\u201d times for, though less so if the stablecoin market does indeed grow substantially. And certainly less so if it happens alongside a systemic event.\n\u201cDeposits in insured depository institutions\u201d is a common, unfortunate phrase, because it implies the institution is insured\u2014rather than deposits up to $250,000. (Yes, in a systemiccrisis, there are mechanisms by which larger amounts can be protected.)\nWe saw the risks to the stablecoin itself of holding reserves in banks when USDC was trading at less than 90 cents on the dollar while SVB\u2019s depositors\u2019 fate was uncertain; when they were rescued, redeeming USDC still faced  of USDC\u2019s bank deposit partners prior to March 2023 is surreal in hindsight\nHowever, this dynamic only turns stablecoins into a financial stability risk if they grow tremendously, such as along the lines of the Standard Chartered estimates.",
              "The greater financial stability risk here, even at current stablecoin market caps, is akin to that noted for Treasury-backed repos: the tying of senior financial system funding (deposits in this case) to crypto market cap. That it\u2019s typically been mid-sized banks servicing crypto means stablecoin (and other crypto) deposits can represent a material part of the funding profile (and the market\u2019s view of their )\u2014again, particularly if the stablecoin market grows.\nAnd, to the extent the stablecoin market grows by coming into its own as a retail payment product, stablecoins would be effectively gathering insured (stable) deposits and , uninsured deposits concentrated in the banks servicing these clients.\nBitcoin, commodities, foreign commercial paper, whatever. Ironically, this is the one with the least financial stability risk if the stablecoin market remains around its current size and with current transaction purposes, which are, so far,  beyond participating in the crypto ecosystem. Risky assets forming the backing reserve has the least financial stability risk because stablecoin market cap can ebb and flow dramatically in this world and only affect the markets for risk assets, rather than systemically important funding markets.\nIf, however, nonbank stablecoins become a $1T+ market used for mainly real-economy transactions, then there\u2019s financial stability risk in the  losing any money, and you don\u2019t want this risky stuff backing any par liabilities that aren\u2019t issued by a regulated bank. Avoiding the risks in holding these kinds of assets has seemed to be Congress\u2019s primary motivation since it began drafting stablecoin bills. (If stablecoins stay small, however, avoiding such assets is great (stablecoin) consumer protection but may actually be a net negative for financial stability proper.)\nSubscribe below to receive directly to your inbox.

These include the following:\n  * Delays in settlement of one to three business days are common when using traditional payment rails, especially when sending payments cross-border.\n  * Traditional payment processing typically involves multiple intermediaries (for example, correspondent banks and clearing houses); as a result, this process can generate multiple fees.\n  * Complex legacy infrastructure can obscure the routing and status of payments, especially during international transfers.\n  * Payment systems reliant on the traditional banking system usually only operate during business hours, which do not include weekends and holidays.\n  * Since much of the traditional payments infrastructure relies on banks, many people are underserved or excluded by KYC regulations and face other access hurdles such as the need for a state-issued ID or multiple proofs of residence.",
              "In addition, the creation of domestic payment systems (often unique to continents and even to individual markets) has led to many siloed systems and proprietary networks, making true global integration of payments difficult to achieve (Exhibit 2).\nImage description: A table compares legacy payment rails and stablecoin across speed, cost, cross-border, automation and programmability, security, transparency, settlement risks, and availability. Overall, stablecoins offer transformative capabilities that address key limitations of legacy payment systems, such as increased speed; lower costs; borderless, minimal, or nonexistent foreign transaction fees; and 24/7 operations. End of image description.\nOn top of these perennial issues, there has been a proliferation of needs, including merchant settlements, business-to-business payments, cross-border payments, retail remittances, and automated payments (for example, from government). As a result, demand has grown in the past decade for more-responsive, real-time, low-cost, secure, and inclusive global payment solutions.\nSome incumbents historically may have hesitated to pursue innovative payment systems in part because they might disrupt existing revenue lines. Competition among financial institutions has stymied efforts to collaborate, while a lack of standardization and consistent international regulations has prevented the emergence of a modern, global system. However, we believe such incumbents should continue to innovate, even if this might compete with existing revenue streams. Value drivers of existing legacy payment systems, such as ubiquity of acceptance and consumer protections, suggest they are not about to disappear.",

              "## How do stablecoins impact cross-border business payments compared to traditional methods? \nStablecoins most clearly outperform traditional payments when it comes to cross-border transactions.\nInternational wire transfers move via the network. A payment might pass through five or more correspondent banks, each taking a cut and delaying settlement. Funds can spend up to a week in transit with little visibility into where they are at any given moment. Costs add up quickly through up-front charges, extra fees per intermediary, and a percentage in FX spread. To mitigate them, companies often prefund accounts abroad, which ties up working capital. In some markets, local cards or banks simply can\u2019t connect internationally, which excludes entire customer segments.\nA stablecoin transfer removes the intermediaries, goes directly from sender to recipient, and is visible in real time on a public ledger. Settlement takes minutes, and blockchain costs are low. Contractors or vendors in can receive digital dollars even without a US bank account. In countries with volatile currencies, stablecoins can hold the steady value that local systems can\u2019t provide.\nStablecoins can reduce costs, open up new customer bases, and remove the opacity that has long plagued international money movement.\n## What are the compliance and regulatory considerations for stablecoins compared to traditional payments? \nTraditional payment networks follow mature rulebooks. Banks enforce Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, card networks build in consumer protections, and regulators have had decades to refine oversight. Banks and processors typically handle compliance.",
              "Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to a real-world asset, often a fiat currency such as the US dollar (USD) or , and are designed to hold steady value. One , for example, is designed to always equal roughly one dollar because it\u2019s backed by USD reserves. Businesses use stablecoins because they combine crypto\u2019s speed and reach with fiat\u2019s predictability.\nA typical payment works like this: a customer sends stablecoins from their digital wallet to the business\u2019s wallet and settlement occurs within minutes. There are no bank cutoff times and no pending statuses. Companies can keep the tokens for future payments or instantly convert them into local currency through a provider like .\n## What are the traditional payment methods in business? \nBusinesses still regularly move money through familiar networks: cards, bank transfers, and\u2014to a lesser extent\u2014cash or checks. Traditional networks are well known and universal but are generally slower, subject to higher fees, and restricted by banking hours. Here\u2019s a closer look at each method:\n  * These transactions depend on like Visa and Mastercard, with issuing banks, acquiring banks, and processors in the mix. The purchase feels instant to the customer, but businesses usually wait 1\u20133 days for settlement and pay a percentage of the transaction amount plus a flat fee.\n  * Making transfers through your bank is inexpensive but can take days. Wire transfers are faster but involve higher fees and sometimes hidden foreign exchange markups. Payments that are routed through multiple correspondent banks can take up to a week.\n  * While cash and checks are still used in some markets, they\u2019re costly to handle and painfully slow to clear.",
              "## How do stablecoin payments work for businesses compared to traditional payments? \nFundamentally, both and traditional payments do the same thing: they move value from the customer to the business. But stablecoins are an internet-native payment method with instant finality, while traditional methods rely on legacy institutions, intermediaries, and multiday settlement. Here\u2019s how each payment type works.\nA business provides a digital wallet address. The customer sends the agreed amount. Within minutes, the tokens settle on a blockchain and land in the business\u2019s wallet. The transfer is visible on a public network and it can\u2019t be reversed once it\u2019s confirmed. There are no bank intermediaries or cutoff times for processing. The business can hold stablecoins to pay suppliers or hedge against local volatility, or it can instantly convert them to local currency through an exchange or processor.\nCard flows run through layers, from the payment processor to the to the card network to the issuing bank. The business receives authorization instantly, but funds settle in batches a few days later. Direct deposits are slower still: domestic wire transfers can be same-day, but international ones often take days and pass through multiple correspondent banks. Some of these systems allow reversals (e.g., chargebacks on cards).\n## How do stablecoins compare to traditional payments on speed and settlement? \nStablecoins settle at internet speed. A transfer usually clears within seconds or minutes at any time of day, any day of the year. There are no cutoff times and no bank holidays. The payment is final once it\u2019s confirmed on the chain and it\u2019s irreversible like cash payment.\nTraditional systems are comparatively sluggish. Cards and take 1\u20133 business days. International wire transfers can take five days or more, especially if they route through multiple correspondent banks. Even a same-day domestic wire transfer is subject to bank cutoff times."

              "Stablecoins: An Alternative Payment Method for Merchants?\nA new wave of payment innovation is upon us, and it is fueled, at least in part, by digital-first consumers\u2019 and merchants\u2019 concerns about the rising costs of traditional payment methods. Stablecoins, which are digital assets capable of being redeemed for a fixed amount of monetary value, stand out as one such innovative payment method that reduces friction by allowing lower costs and faster settlement for merchants, all without the need to rely on traditional payment card networks. There\u2019s a rumor that several large merchants are exploring issuing their own stablecoins as an alternative payment method to reduce acceptance costs. And the [recently passed Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/insights/newsletters/2025/07/newsletters-practices-dcb-digital-currency-blockchain-q2-2025) provides a regulatory regime that could expand the adoption of stablecoins as alternative pay.",
              "A key driver to the adoption of stablecoins as an alternative payment is the elimination of the costs inherent in accepting traditional payment cards. Most merchants pay transaction and interchange fees \u2014 which may vary depending on the type of merchant, the type of transaction (e.g., card present or not present), and the card type \u2014 as a condition to acceptance of traditional payment cards (e.g., Amex, Mastercard, and Visa). Merchants\u2019 obligation to honor all cards, coupled with surcharging restrictions, have left merchants with little flexibility when it comes to acceptance costs, unless the merchant has a separate incentive arrangement with a card payment network to reduce acceptance costs. Because stablecoins operate on blockchain networks, direct transactions between a merchant and a customer can occur with minimal or no involvement from traditional financial institutions, which will eliminate the need for many acceptance fees and potentially introduce other inherent cost savings for merchants (e.g., reserve requirements and chargeback risks). \nBecause of their use of blockchain technology, stablecoins also significantly reduce settlement times associated with traditional payment rails by \n  * bypassing intermediaries in the clearing process, including many of the players in the current payment infrastructure (e.g., networks, issuing banks, acquiring banks, processors); \n  * offering 24-7 availability, reducing delays based on time zones, weekends, and holidays; and\n  * reducing reconciliation time due to the use of a public ledger.",
              "Stablecoins, therefore, satisfy the increasing demand for instant settlement, particularly in an increasingly global marketplace. \nEven with these benefits, however, the lack of a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins may impede wider adoption by merchants and consumers alike.\n## The Promise of the GENIUS Act\nThe GENIUS Act, which establishes the first federal regulatory framework specifically for the issuance and use of payment stablecoins, passed in the Senate and the House with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Trump on July 18, 2025. Among other requirements, the GENIUS Act requires issuers to provide a full reserve for dollar-backed stablecoins and to provide monthly public disclosures and audited financial statements. Stablecoin issuers will also be subject to the Bank Secrecy Act for anti-money laundering and related purposes and would be subject to oversight by federal or state regulators. \nThe passage of the GENIUS Act represents a significant step forward with the broader adoption of stablecoins, and blockchain more generally, across the payments space. Payment providers like PayPal and Stripe already support stablecoin transactions, and other platforms are expected to soon follow. And while merchants may be initially hesitant to embrace this alternative payment method, any up-front investment required to integrate this technology will be substantially outweighed by the benefits of stablecoins, which present the opportunity to improve both the customer experience and the merchant\u2019s bottom line.\nWe practice in every fintech vertical, including payments, deposits, lending, digital assets, and alternative finance. \n_This informational piece, which may be considered advertising under the ethical rules of certain jurisdictions, is provided on the understanding that it does not constitute the rendering of legal advice or other professional advice by Goodwin or its lawyers.

They are also programmable, which means they can be automatically managed and controlled. This makes them a relatively reliable medium of exchange within the blockchain universe.\n\u201cStablecoins are a digital, on-chain form of fiat money. They are easy to self-custody and transact, and they are also fast, particularly in the context of cross-border money movement. One could even consider them a better form than fiat, as they can move quicker and less expensively across existing financial infrastructure in certain circumstances,\u201d Worthington said. As such, they are well-suited for the traditional financial services system, where the movement of cash needs to keep pace with transactions that are increasingly executed outside of usual business hours.\nOn the flip side, stablecoins could pose a threat to financial stability. For instance, stablecoins could have significant run risks, in which a large group of investors redeem their holdings simultaneously. \u201cThe collapse of TerraUSD in May 2022 highlights just how quickly a run can occur, in an asset class that trades 24/7,\u201d Ho remarked. The effects of a massive liquidation could spill over to other markets, destabilizing the traditional banking system.\nIn addition, the [Bank for International Settlements (BIS)](https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2025e3.htm) posits that stablecoins fall short on three key tests for money:\n  * Stablecoins that are traded in secondary markets might be exchanged at a slight deviation from par with the fiat currency they are pegged to.\n  * The issuer\u2019s balance sheet cannot be expanded at will, and any additional supply of stablecoins would require full upfront payment by its holders."

In all of these arenas, banks and nonbanks will compete, and the question of whether federal and state standards are actually equivalent figures to be a live question for years to come. Even where banks, nonbanks, and state charters will be subject to equivalent stablecoin issuance regulatory regimes, banks and bank holding companies will be starting from a place of heightened regulatory restrictions \u2014 with supervision, capital, liquidity, management, activity, and affiliate transaction requirements that nonbanks do not have. Moreover, nonbank digital assets companies may have more experience and technical know-how in blockchain markets and applications that make them better suited to many roles within the payment stablecoin ecosystem. And, of course, banks, as depository institutions, may operate as service providers to payment stablecoin issuers, for example, as providers of deposit reserves and custody services, while developing other new services to, and partnerships with, digital asset companies and other nonbanks.

In addition, increased holdings of stablecoins by the public could potentially draw down bank deposits and thereby limit the efficacy of monetary policy. On the other hand, if issuers hold cash reserves as deposits and steer new cash into banks, such as from unbanked or foreign populations, stablecoin uptake may increase deposits and enhance the transmission of monetary policy. The composition of reserves also has implications for public finance\u2014U.S. Treasury securities, not cash, [are currently the favored reserve asset](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2025/04/stablecoins-and-crypto-shocks-an-update/) of the largest stablecoin issuers, who are already as significant holders of Treasury bills as the largest U.S. money market funds. Continued stablecoin growth could therefore bolster demand for government debt, not to mention the global dominance of the dollar, which is overwhelmingly the peg of choice among tokens currently in circulation.\n## How are stablecoins regulated in the US?",
              "In July 2025, Congress passed the , which [establishes a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/stablecoins-issues-for-regulators-as-they-implement-genius-act/). Similar to the U.S.\u2019s dual banking system, stablecoin issuers may apply for approval from either federal or (if total issuance is below $10 billion) state regulators in states where such regulation exists. Issuers must back their stablecoins one-to-one with reserves of cash or other permitted assets\u2014such as Treasury securities, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, government money market funds, bank deposits, or tokenized versions of the same\u2014and must report monthly on the composition of their reserves. Issuers will also be subject to federal anti-money laundering regulations. Their stablecoins, which cannot pay interest, must be redeemable for a fixed monetary value. The law designates the Treasury\u2019s Comptroller of the Currency as the federal regulator for nonbank issuers, whereas bank subsidiaries that wish to issue stablecoins will be regulated by the applicable state or federal bank regulators. State and federal regulators have until July 2026 to finalize implementation rules, including stablecoins\u2019 tax characterization, standards for foreign stablecoins sold in the U.S., and policies regarding conflicts of interest for stablecoin issuers, an issue of public debate [given the Trump family\u2019s growing business in crypto assets](https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/09/02/trump-world-liberty-financial-crypto-blockchain-token-wealth-bitcoin/).

Many state governments [have applied existing rules, and some have passed new laws](https://stevenscenter.wharton.upenn.edu/publications-50-state-review/), to subject issuers and exchangers of crypto assets to regulations for consumer protection and financial soundness. Money transmitters are required to register with the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which in 2013 clarified that reporting requirements for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) [apply equally to the transmission of crypto assets](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/guidance/application-fincens-regulations-persons-administering).

All issuers fall under the Bank Secrecy Act, making AML/CFT and sanctions compliance non-negotiable.\n  * Payment stablecoins are carved out from securities and commodities law, removing them from SEC and CFTC jurisdiction and squarely placing oversight with banking regulators.",
              "The impact on the market has been immediate Coinbase, Circle, and other US-linked issuers are seen as compliance winners, while offshore or under-collateralised tokens face significant pressure. There is reason to think the Treasury could benefit too: mandatory T-bill reserves mean stablecoin issuers may become major buyers of government debt, reinforcing dollar demand globally. Critics, however, warn of financial-stability spillovers \u2014 if redemptions force mass Treasury sales, yields could spike.\nThe EU introduced its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) in 2024. It sets out a licensing regime for issuers of \u201casset-referenced tokens\u201d and \u201ce-money tokens\u201d, with strict requirements on capital, governance, and reserve management. MiCA also allows regulators to restrict non-euro stablecoins if their use exceeds 1 million transactions and EUR 200 million per day, a safeguard aimed at protecting monetary sovereignty. While the regime creates compliance costs, it also offers legal certainty, potentially boosting adoption among institutional users. For global issuers, however, the euro-centric design presents strategic challenges.\n## United Kingdom: Integrating into FSMA\nThe UK is in the process of bringing stablecoins under existing payments and e-money legislation via amendments to the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA), with draft rules under consultation. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will oversee compliance, while the Bank of England will supervise systemic stablecoins. The Treasury has made clear that privately issued stablecoins can play a role in payments, provided they meet operational resilience and redemption standards. This pragmatic approach aligns with the UK\u2019s ambition to be a digital finance hub, but details of secondary legislation and supervisory intensity remain to be tested.",
              "These themes reflect regulators\u2019 balancing act: encouraging innovation while safeguarding monetary stability.\nStablecoins remain a small section of the wider cryptocurrency market, but recent regulatory developments give reason to think their share may grow. Whilst cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are speculative assets, stablecoins\u2019 reduced volatility makes them more viable as a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account.\nNew rules generally raise barriers to entry. Smaller issuers may exit or partner with regulated institutions, while larger players with balance-sheet capacity consolidate market share. This mirrors patterns seen in e-money and payments regulation over the past decade.\nBanks and established PSPs are entering the stablecoin arena, either by issuing tokens directly or by providing custody and reserve services. This could erode the first-mover advantage of crypto-native firms and tilt the market towards regulated incumbents.\nMiCA\u2019s daily transaction cap on non-euro stablecoins could limit the use of USD-backed coins in Europe, potentially fragmenting money flow. Conversely, the clarity provided by the framework may encourage the development of euro-denominated alternatives. With the GENIUS Act, the US has removed much of the regulatory uncertainty that previously pushed innovation abroad. While smaller issuers may still find compliance burdens heavy, larger players now have a clearer pathway to operate domestically.\nThe lack of harmonisation complicates cross-border payments. A stablecoin fully compliant in Singapore may fall foul of MiCA caps or US banking rules. For multinational PSPs, this means higher legal complexity, compliance costs, and operational risk."

Stablecoins have also long been a lynchpin of cryptocurrency transactions, allowing users to move relatively easily from cryptocurrency to \u201cfiat\u201d through a stablecoin and then back into a different cryptocurrency.\nUse of stablecoins in connection with cryptocurrency transactions has been highly successful. In 2024, total stablecoin transfer volume was US$27.6 trillion, almost all of it used for digital asset transactions, and its market capitalization grew to US$150 billion. However, adoption of these digital assets for cross-border transactions or for retail payments has been slow, due in large part to uncertainty as to how stablecoins would be regulated. Recently, however, the regulatory landscape has become much clearer, particularly in the United States, paving the way for widespread adoption of stablecoins.

Across the country, money transmission laws apply to stablecoin-related activities. However, some states, such as New York, offer specific guidance or entire regulatory regimes tailored for stablecoins. New York pioneered the BitLicense in 2015, which operates as a license and charter-based system for digital assets. \nSuch a license is required to conduct a digital asset business in New York. In June 2022, New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) released guidance on issuing U.S. dollar\u2013backed stablecoins. \nIndustry Guidance, Adrienne A.

The guidance creates \u201crecommendations or principles\u201d related to redeemability, reserves, and attestation (confirmation of accounting statements). Stablecoin issuers must hold at least a 1:1 ratio of reserves segregated from other assets, and the reserves must be highly liquid.",
              "The reserves are subject to NYDFS approval and may only be comprised of \u201cU.S. Treasury bills acquired by the Issuer three months or less from their respective maturities\u201d; \u201cReverse repurchase agreements fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes, and/or U.S. Treasury bonds on an overnight basis\u201d; \u201cGovernment money-market funds\u201d; or \u201cDeposit accounts at U.S. state or federally chartered depository institutions.\u201d Issuers must adopt clear redemption policies that allow for timely redemption (not more than two full business days) at par value. Moreover, stablecoin issuers must release public attestations monthly that a third-party accountant verifies. NYDFS issued these requirements as guidance, not rules. However, the guidance states that \u201c[i]ssuers that currently issue U.S. dollar\u2013backed stablecoins under DFS supervision are expected to come into compliance with this Guidance within three months of the date hereof.\u201d \nAlthough there are many differences in jurisdictional approaches to stablecoin regulation, some common regulatory principles emerge:\n  1. Stablecoin issuances require explicit regulatory approval by the appropriate regulator.\n  2. Reserves must be liquid and stable, ensuring that they can cover all issued stablecoins on a 1:1 basis.\n  3. Stablecoin payment services must align with existing financial regulations, offering protections akin to traditional currency-based payment systems. \nCryptocurrency companies in the U.S. are already subject to all state-based money-service business laws and must register as a money services business (MSB) in any state in which they operate.",

The EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) categorizes stablecoins into electronic money tokens (EMTs) and asset-referenced tokens (ARTs). The UK framework categorizes stablecoin payments as hybrid or pure.\n  * The U.S. lacks comprehensive federal legislation, but certain existing regulations apply.

Switzerland maintains a guidance-based approach offering flexibility but less legal certainty.\nThe GENIUS Act\u2019s comparable regime provisions may open opportunities for regulatory reciprocity, particularly with jurisdictions adopting similar prudential standards. However, initial determinations will likely prove restrictive given the unanimous approval requirement and high U.S. standards.\nSection 15 of the GENIUS Act further directs the Federal Reserve and Treasury to pursue reciprocal agreements with foreign jurisdictions, indicating congressional intent to eventually harmonize global stablecoin standards beyond the narrow comparable regime framework.\n## Other Key Takeaways for Market Participants\nExisting Stablecoin Issuers should immediately assess their path to compliance, determining whether federal or state licensing best suits their business model. Reserve portfolios require realignment to permitted assets, and operational infrastructure needs significant enhancement to meet disclosure and technical requirements.\nFinancial Institutions should evaluate opportunities in stablecoin issuance, leveraging existing regulatory relationships and infrastructure advantages.

              "# How to Build a Compliant Stablecoin Infrastructure for Enterprise Use\nBuilding a compliant stablecoin infrastructure is essential for enterprises exploring blockchain payments. Stablecoins offer speed, transparency and 24/7 settlement, but they also come with regulatory requirements and operational risks. Industry leaders embed compliance from day one integrating KYC/AML checks, travel-rule data sharing, and transaction monitoring directly into their payment stacks.\nIn practice, \u201cstablecoin compliance\u201d means meeting the same regulatory standards as traditional finance: rigorous identity verification, on-chain transaction scrutiny, and adherence to global laws. By prioritizing compliance early, businesses earn the trust of banks and regulators and unlock the full potential of blockchain-based enterprise payments.\nBuilding trust with stablecoins requires addressing several core requirements:\n  * \u2014 Verified onboarding of wallet users. Enterprises must use robust identity checks (government IDs, biometrics, proof-of-address) and link those credentials to blockchain addresses. Some solutions now offer \u201con-chain KYC,\u201d where cryptographic attestations of a user\u2019s verified identity are anchored on-chain without exposing personal data. This lets compliant users transact permissionlessly while signaling their KYC status to smart contracts. As Fireblocks notes, firms should implement workflows that \u201cverify identities through documentation and biometrics\u201d and perform dynamic risk assessments (behavioral analysis, device fingerprinting, geolocation checks) during onboarding.",
              "Secure custody builds confidence with regulators and partners. It also safeguards the business itself: as McKinsey notes, losing keys or reserve control can undermine the entire stablecoin project, even if the blockchain protocol is sound.\n## Smart Contracts, APIs and Integration\nA compliant stablecoin infrastructure also relies on . Smart contracts must be securely written and audited, and enterprise systems (bank ledgers, ERP, CRM) need API connectivity to the crypto rails.\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n_Diagram of enterprise smart contract architecture showing modular compliance hooks and API integration with payment systems (Source: Kaleido)_\n  * Every token contract or payment contract should undergo a rigorous security review before deployment. Auditors can verify that the contract has no logic errors and properly incorporates compliance checks. For example, a contract might include functions or modifiers that automatically block transfers involving non-verified addresses or blacklisted wallets. Embedding such checks at the code level can a transaction at the moment it violates policy.\n  * Architect the system so that KYC/AML components are modular and pluggable. For instance, a payment API might call out to an external compliance engine before executing any transaction. This way, updates to global sanctions lists or local regulations can be integrated without redesigning the whole system.\n  * Use APIs and middleware to connect stablecoins with existing corporate treasury and payment systems. An enterprise-ready ledger should translate stablecoin transactions into the company\u2019s accounting system, update accounts payable/receivable, and trigger corporate controls (just like a SWIFT message would). This ensures stablecoins become a first-class asset in the enterprise finance stack."

              "The smart contract architecture of stablecoins extends beyond basic token functionality to include specialized features required for stability maintenance and regulatory compliance. Advanced stablecoin implementations incorporate features such as pause functionality for emergency situations, blacklist capabilities for regulatory compliance and upgrade \nmechanisms that allow issuers to modify contract behavior while maintaining token continuity. \nMulti-signature controls represent critical security features in stablecoin smart contracts, requiring multiple authorized parties to approve significant actions such as token minting, contract upgrades or emergency pauses. These controls help prevent single points of failure and provide additional security layers that are particularly important for institutional adoption and regulatory compliance. \nThe transparency characteristics of blockchain technology create both opportunities and challenges for stablecoin operations. While all transactions are publicly visible and verifiable, providing unprecedented transparency into stablecoin flows and usage patterns, this visibility also creates privacy considerations for institutional users if the transactions are on public blockchains, as opposed to private blockchains, and potential compliance challenges in jurisdictions with strict financial privacy requirements. \nThe multi-chain nature of modern blockchain infrastructure has led to the deployment of major stablecoins across multiple networks, each with distinct technical characteristics and trade-offs. for example, operates on over ten different blockchain networks including Ethereum, Tron, Polygon and Avalanche, with each deployment requiring separate technical integration and risk assessment [12].",
              "Cross-chain bridge technology enables the transfer of stablecoins between different blockchain networks, but these bridges represent additional technical and security risks that must be evaluated in institutional risk management frameworks. Bridge exploits have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, highlighting the importance of understanding cross-chain risks when evaluating multi-chain stablecoin strategies. In addition, the interoperability of the cryptoasset ecosystem means that bridge functionality allows bad actors to use this feature to obfuscate stablecoin transactions before it is off-ramped to fiat.\nThe governance structures of stablecoin protocols determine how technical parameters are adjusted, upgrades are implemented and emergency responses are coordinated. These governance mechanisms represent critical components of stablecoin systems that directly impact their long-term stability and adaptability to changing market conditions. \nDecentralized governance through token voting enables community control over protocol parameters but may also introduce decision-making delays and coordination challenges during crisis situations. The balance between decentralization and operational efficiency represents an ongoing challenge for stablecoin protocol design and a key consideration for institutional evaluation. \nEmergency response mechanisms, including pause functionality and emergency governance procedures, provide critical safeguards for stablecoin systems during extreme market conditions or security incidents. Understanding these mechanisms and their activation procedures is essential for institutional risk management and contingency planning."

For more recent commentary by Nellie Liang, read \nStablecoins continue to grow, and use cases are increasing. The vast majority are tied to the U.S. dollar, but the U.S. lacks a strong, consistent, and coherent regulatory framework. I describe below some essential features of a regulatory framework for the U.S. that would both support financial innovation and reduce serious risks, many of which were highlighted in in 2021 by the President\u2019s Working Group. Current financial regulations, mainly a diverse set of state money transmitter licensing requirements, are inadequate for significant stablecoins that operate across state and national borders, raise new and unique illicit finance risks, and threaten monetary and financial stability.\nStablecoins function as \u201cdigital cash\u201d issued by a private firm that is recorded and transferred on a blockchain rather than on the books and records of a commercial bank or central bank. The market value of stablecoins has grown from less than $20 billion in 2019 to more than $230 billion on a global basis in early 2025. Stablecoins currently are used mainly for trading crypto assets, although there is growing use of USD-based stablecoins in countries with less stable domestic currencies. Evidence points to increased use for terrorist financing and money laundering.",
              "to increase competition and efficiency of payments and capital markets activities as well as to support the global role of the dollar and U.S. national security. Stablecoins could make payments more efficient and available in real time as consumers increasingly demand faster, cheaper payments and businesses aim for efficiencies. For instance, blockchain rails could increase efficiency and innovation in cross-border payments and corporate treasury management as well as in merchant payments. The upside is greater if tokenization of securities becomes more widespread, since stablecoins would be a natural means of payment for securities transactions that are executed on-chain.\nBut stablecoins come with risks. From a financial stability perspective, they could be subject to runs if their value is not truly stable, and they could undermine the safety of payments if their operations are not robust to a range of operational and cyber threats. And their potential to scale rapidly because of network effects could increase risks to credit intermediation and monetary policy transmission if insured depository institutions lose significant deposits to stablecoins, or could lead to excessive concentration of power if stablecoins are issued by commercial firms. In addition, stablecoins present new and significant illicit financing risks since values can be transferred quickly across borders if actors are able to exploit weaknesses in international anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards. \nTo address the risks that stablecoins pose, a regulatory framework should include seven essential features:",
              "1. Reserve assets of a stablecoin issuer need to be ultra-safe and liquid if stablecoins are to function as money issued by a private firm. Because stablecoins do not have deposit insurance or access to a lender of last resort, they need to be backed by safe and liquid assets, like cash, Treasury bills, and central bank reserves, so they can offer convertibility at par. If assets with either credit or counterparty risk were to be permitted, the stablecoin issuer should be required to hold more capital and liquidity for those risks. Private money backed by risky assets with inadequate capital would be vulnerable to destabilizing runs and lose its ability to function as a medium of exchange.\n  2. Stablecoin issuers\u2019 activities should be limited to issuance and redemption (and ancillary activities), and issuers that achieve significant size should be subject to prudential federal regulations for capital, liquidity, and risk management calibrated to its limited activities. An issuer also should be subject to strong operational standards to ensure payment finality and reliability and its resilience to crypto, cyber, and other threats. In addition, stablecoin issuers should be subject to consumer protection rules that apply to similar payment products and services. At a minimum, the qualifications and integrity of an applicant should be considered when financial regulators consider granting a charter, either for a nonbank or a subsidiary of a depository institution.\n  3. Reserve assets of a stablecoin should be segregated and prioritized in bankruptcy, so that holders can still access their payment stablecoins if a stablecoin issuer were to fail. Clear rights to immediate redemption are needed for stablecoins of a failing issuer to prevent payment disruptions even as the issuer\u2019s liabilities are settled in bankruptcy over a longer period."

They could reshape how the government pays contractors. If adopted, these tools could be used to:\n  * Deliver real-time payments to vendors and subrecipients\n  * Cut foreign exchange costs for international projects\n  * Speed up disbursements for grants or disaster relief\n  * Maintain transparent, traceable records that meet audit requirements\n\nThis shift also helps preserve the dollar\u2019s global standing.

              "## How Payment Firms and Institutions Embed Stablecoins\nIntegrating stablecoins into a payments stack requires more than just adding a token, it means engaging with the underlying systems that make secure, compliant, and scalable digital asset operations possible. For firms building stablecoin-powered flows, success depends on a coordinated of custody, network access, APIs, and reconciliation systems.\nNot every institution begins with full-stack . Many start by partnering with third parties to access the rails. But over time, as internal expertise and regulatory clarity grow, firms move toward more direct control of custody, execution, and treasury. This transition, from C, is increasingly measured in months, not years.\nPlatforms that anticipate this journey, and architect for it early, gain the speed, margin, and resilience advantages that come from owning the payment flow.Here are four foundational components:\n### 1. Custody and Wallet Infrastructure\nStablecoins need to be securely held before they can move. Most payment firms implement either custodial or self-custodial wallet models, depending on their regulatory posture, internal expertise, and desired control.\n  * rely on regulated third parties to store assets and manage private keys.\n  * offers greater control but also requires robust key management, policy enforcement, and operational safeguards.\n\n  * Segregated wallets for clients or use cases\n  * Granular access control to mitigate operational risk\n  * Pre-transaction simulation and approval workflows\n  * Compatibility with internal ledgering and treasury systems",
              "Wallet orchestration is also essential, especially for platforms managing both corporate treasury and end-user balances within the same environment.\nStablecoin transactions settle on blockchain networks, each with distinct trade-offs in speed, cost, and ecosystem compatibility.\n  * \u2013 well-supported, highly secure, but relatively expensive\n  * , , \u2013 cost-effective and fast, often favored in emerging markets\n  * , , \u2013 optimized for specific geographies or use cases\n\n  * (signing, gas fees, execution)\n  * , as stablecoins often exist across multiple networks\n  * Interoperability tools to reduce fragmentation and support \n\nFirms often select multiple blockchains to balance reliability with regional cost-efficiency and latency needs.\n### 3. APIs for Checkout and Settlement\nTo make stablecoins usable at scale, they must plug directly into familiar payment and treasury workflows. This is typically done through APIs that abstract blockchain complexity and connect on-chain assets with front-end interfaces or back-office systems.\n  * Real-time merchant settlement or mass payouts\n  * Internal disbursements (e.g., payroll, affiliate commissions)\n\n  * Integrated conversion (e.g., auto-swap to fiat)\n  * Regulatory and KYC/KYB workflows behind the scenes\n\nSome firms embed these APIs into proprietary platforms; others rely on third-party orchestration to simplify implementation and compliance.\n### 4. Multi-Stablecoin Support, FX Management, and Reconciliation\nThe proliferation of fiat-backed stablecoins, USDC, PYUSD, EURC, FDUSD, and others, means payment platforms must manage multiple currencies and conversion pathways.\n  * Support for stablecoin-to-stablecoin and fiat-to-stablecoin FX\n  * Dynamic pricing and routing tools to optimize costs across venues and partners\n  * Automated reconciliation tools that map on-chain flows to internal ledgers or ERP systems",
              "Leading platforms integrate these capabilities with:\n  * Policy controls for approved currencies and corridors\n  * Reporting systems for audit and compliance needs\n  * Real-time visibility into wallet-level balances and flows\n\n## Risks and Challenges of Integrating Stablecoins into Payment Infrastructure\nWhile stablecoins offer speed, transparency, and programmable features that make them an attractive addition to modern payment systems, their integration introduces several structural and operational challenges. For payment firms and institutions, understanding and addressing these risks is essential to unlocking the full benefits of stablecoin-based payments.\n### 1. Regulatory Compliance and AML Requirements\nStablecoins exist at the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology, creating complexities for teams. Anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CTF), Know Your Customer (KYC), and Travel Rule requirements apply, but their enforcement varies widely across jurisdictions.\n  * Unlike centralized financial rails, blockchain-based stablecoin transactions are typically pseudonymous and irreversible, complicating regulatory enforcement.\n  * Firms must implement robust KYC/KYB procedures, monitor wallet activity in real time, and ensure compliance with global sanctions frameworks such as OFAC.\n  * Key vulnerabilities include on/off-ramps, unhosted wallets, and jurisdictional mismatches, which often fall into regulatory gray areas.\n  * Many regulators have responded with frameworks requiring enhanced due diligence, user verification, and pre-transaction compliance checks.\n  * The new FATF Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to collect and disclose specific customer data when transacting digital assets over a particular value threshold. Global jurisdictions currently have different disclosure and threshold requirements with varied enforcement."

Visa announced a stablecoin prefunding pilot through Visa Direct at SIBOS 2025, aimed at enabling faster business transactions. Tether unveiled USAT, a U.S.-based stablecoin designed to strengthen its presence in the U.S. market. Additionally, nine major European banks, including ING and UniCredit, have collaborated to explore or issue a new stablecoin, showcasing the growing interest from traditional financial institutions..\n## The Infrastructure Layer: What It Takes to Support Stablecoin Payments\nMaking stablecoin payments work for e-commerce requires more than just a blockchain. It needs a sophisticated technology stack that connects digital assets to the traditional financial world in a secure and compliant way.\nSeveral components are essential for building a robust system for stablecoin payments:\n  * Businesses need a safe place to hold their digital assets. must include enterprise-grade custody solutions, like multi-party computation (MPC) wallets, which protect funds from theft and unauthorized access. The settlement layer ensures that transactions are cleared and finalized reliably.\n  * For merchants to accept stablecoins, they need easy-to-integrate tools. Payment gateways and APIs act as the bridge, allowing e-commerce platforms to connect to blockchain networks without needing to build complex systems from scratch.\n  * To operate legally, payment providers must adhere to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. The best infrastructure for stablecoin payments integrates these compliance checks directly into the transaction flow, ensuring every payment is screened."

But behind the scenes, the platform is orchestrating on-chain transfers in real time.\nBecause this is a direct connection, you\u2019ll have to handle custody\u2014hot wallets for day-to-day flows and cold storage for reserves. Our team has recently helped a implement an effective treasury management mechanism for maintaining appropriate liquidity levels of stablecoin and cryptocurrencies traded on the platform. It allows them to on/off-ramp crypto, enforce security, and automate transfer policies between different wallets.\nCompliance also sits squarely on your side. Every inbound and outbound transfer should be screened against sanctions lists and blockchain analytics tools to prevent illicit flows. One way to do this is via smart contracts.Most centralized stablecoins have embedded logic for on-chain checks. You can program automatic sender/receiver blacklist checks or a command to add or remove addresses from the blacklist based on the off-chain screening you do (e.g., as part of your general KYC/KYB process). Some stablecoins\u2014USDT, USDC, and BUSD\u2014also give functionality to destroy or seize tokens from blacklisted addresses.",

They were necessary in the early days, but have become increasingly cumbersome (and to an extent unnecessary) in the digital finance age.\nStablecoin payments flow over blockchains, which are credibly neutral, auditable, composable, and designed to scale globally. Meaning you can keep full audit trails and add custom controls to prevent fraud or KYC\u2014all while benefiting from an already existing and widely adopted technology, linking people everywhere, just like an email.\nFor individuals, it means accessible, instant, and transparent money movement. For businesses, that translates into better cash flow predictability, smoother working capital management, and far fewer reconciliation headaches.\nAnd this opens up a new pane of use cases.\nThe global remittances stood at last year, with one billion people using some money transfer service. But the experience is far from great. Fees are high, and transfers take a long time to get routed.\nStablecoins eliminate the chain of correspondent banks by moving value directly on-chain, enabling transfers in seconds at a fraction of the cost of traditional remittance services."

          "answer": "**Report: Should the United States Adopt Stablecoin as an Official Digital Currency?**\n\n---\n\n### **1. Introduction**\n\nStablecoins are digital currencies pegged to stable assets such as the U.S. dollar or Treasury securities. Adopting a stablecoin as an **official U.S. digital currency** would mark a major transformation in how money circulates, how the Federal Reserve implements policy, and how payments are processed nationwide. Evaluating this decision demands a balanced understanding of three interrelated domains: **economic implications**, **regulatory and policy frameworks**, and **technological feasibility**. Each carries opportunities for innovation and risk\u2014particularly when integrating blockchain features with a deeply interconnected financial system.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Economic Implications**  \n(From Child 1)\n\nEconomically, an official U.S. stablecoin could **increase efficiency and inclusivity** within the financial system. It would allow **instant settlement and lower transaction costs** by removing intermediaries, potentially accelerating domestic and international payments [1][2][3]. Transparency through blockchain could enhance auditability and reduce reconciliation errors, while programmable \u201csmart contracts\u201d could automate transactions and reduce administrative overhead [1][3][4].  \n\nHowever, the economic transformation would not be without risk. Stablecoin integration could **disrupt liquidity management** in money and Treasury markets, especially if large redemptions triggered instability or forced asset sales [3][4]. The **Federal Reserve\u2019s traditional tools** for controlling liquidity and interest rates might become more complex to deploy in a tokenized environment [1]. Furthermore, as global adoption grows, a U.S. stablecoin might **reinforce dollar dominance** internationally while provoking foreign policy tension around monetary sovereignty [5]. Economically, the benefits hinge on stability and careful oversight: while inclusive and efficient, the system could magnify volatility if poorly designed or governed.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Regulatory and Policy Framework**  \n(From Child 2)\n\nFrom a regulatory standpoint, the U.S. currently faces a **fragmented and overlapping structure** involving the Federal Reserve, Treasury, OCC, FDIC, FinCEN, and various state agencies [1][2][3][4]. This dual federal/state system leads to inconsistency in compliance standards, reserve requirements, and redemption policies. Proposed reforms, such as those under the GENIUS Act, aim to define \u201cpayment stablecoins\u201d as a new category of instrument separate from securities and commodities, thereby consolidating jurisdiction under banking regulators [3].  \n\nComparatively, other jurisdictions like the **EU (MiCA framework)** and **Japan\u2019s Payment Services Law** have implemented clearer, more centralized systems mandating full reserve backing, redemption guarantees, and single-agency oversight [1][2][6]. For the U.S. to follow suit, it would need to **harmonize regulatory oversight**, establish a **unified federal charter** for issuers under the OCC, and guarantee **1:1 reserves with transparent attestation** practices [1][2][6]. Moreover, **cross-border regulatory harmonization** would be critical to avoid arbitrage and to strengthen global interoperability. In short, without substantial reform, the regulatory terrain remains the largest barrier to stablecoin adoption in the U.S.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Technological and Infrastructure Feasibility**  \n(From Child 3)\n\nTechnologically, adopting a national stablecoin is **feasible, but infrastructure dependent**. The core technologies exist: secure multiparty computation (MPC) wallets, real-time reserve monitoring, audited smart contracts, and API-based integration for automated compliance [Child 1]. The infrastructure can support **cross-border interoperability**, **programmable compliance enforcement**, and **real-time transaction screening**, all critical for a regulated digital currency system.  \n\nHowever, integration with **existing banking infrastructures** poses challenges. While APIs could link blockchain systems to bank payment networks, large-scale adoption would require modernization of legacy systems and uniform cryptographic identity standards [Child 2]. Additionally, cybersecurity, privacy preservation, and consistent compliance monitoring are essential to maintain public confidence and resilience. Thus, stablecoin deployment is technologically achievable, but would require phased rollouts and upgrades across public and private channels [Child 1][Child 2].\n\n---\n\n### **5. Synthesis and Evaluation**\n\nTaken together, the findings across the three analyses show interdependent trade-offs. Economically, a stablecoin could **enhance payment efficiency and inclusion** [Child 1]; yet, **fragmented regulation** threatens to offset these gains unless a unified framework is adopted [Child 2]. Technologically, the foundations for secure and interoperable systems exist but demand modernization and policy coordination [Child 3].  \n\nIn practice, **regulatory clarity and institutional reform** would catalyze private-sector investment and infrastructure upgrades, improving both technical and economic readiness. Conversely, premature adoption\u2014before harmonized reserve requirements, AML/KYC interoperability, and monetary policy safeguards\u2014could amplify financial risks and compromise stability.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Conclusion**\n\nBased on the integrated evidence, the United States **should not immediately adopt stablecoin as an official digital currency**, but should **progressively develop and pilot** such a system under unified regulatory oversight.  \n\n- Economically, adoption promises clear gains in efficiency and inclusion, but also systemic risks to liquidity management and monetary control [Child 1].  \n- Regulatively, the U.S. must first establish consistent federal authority, standardized reserve frameworks, and international coordination, following the models of the EU and Japan [Child 2].  \n- Technologically, stablecoin deployment is feasible but contingent on infrastructure modernization and cybersecurity assurance [Child 3].  \n\nA staged, regulated approach\u2014beginning with limited federal pilots, robust supervisory reforms, and infrastructure upgrades\u2014would position the U.S. to realize the benefits of stablecoin innovation while managing associated risks.  \n\n**Recommendation:** Pursue a **phased adoption strategy**, focused first on building a consistent policy and technological foundation before full-scale implementation as the nation\u2019s official digital currency.\n\n---\n\n**Citations:** [1][2][3][4][5][6], [Child 1][Child 2]"

              "Stablecoins offer users several advantages. For starters, they are designed to maintain a stable value, making them less volatile than other cryptocurrencies. They are also programmable, which means they can be automatically managed and controlled. This makes them a relatively reliable medium of exchange within the blockchain universe.\n\u201cStablecoins are a digital, on-chain form of fiat money. They are easy to self-custody and transact, and they are also fast, particularly in the context of cross-border money movement. One could even consider them a better form than fiat, as they can move quicker and less expensively across existing financial infrastructure in certain circumstances,\u201d Worthington said. As such, they are well-suited for the traditional financial services system, where the movement of cash needs to keep pace with transactions that are increasingly executed outside of usual business hours.\nOn the flip side, stablecoins could pose a threat to financial stability. For instance, stablecoins could have significant run risks, in which a large group of investors redeem their holdings simultaneously. \u201cThe collapse of TerraUSD in May 2022 highlights just how quickly a run can occur, in an asset class that trades 24/7,\u201d Ho remarked. The effects of a massive liquidation could spill over to other markets, destabilizing the traditional banking system.\nIn addition, the [Bank for International Settlements (BIS)](https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2025e3.htm) posits that stablecoins fall short on three key tests for money:\n  * Stablecoins that are traded in secondary markets might be exchanged at a slight deviation from par with the fiat currency they are pegged to.\n  * The issuer\u2019s balance sheet cannot be expanded at will, and any additional supply of stablecoins would require full upfront payment by its holders.",
              "In addition, the bill establishes strict reserve requirements, mandating that each stablecoin be backed one-to-one with U.S. dollars, short-term Treasuries and other high-quality assets. However, it is unclear whether non-bank stablecoin issuers will have access to the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, which is critical when it comes to addressing run risks.\n\u201cClearly, these developments are still very much in their nascent phase. But one thing is for certain \u2014 there is more to come as the industry continues to explore product innovation to integrate stablecoins into the traditional financial system,\u201d Ho said. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early to know how this will play out, but it could potentially challenge how we think about liquidity in the money markets over the longer term.\u201d \nListen to our latest episode from Making Sense: How stablecoins are reshaping global finance\nIn this episode, Kenneth Worthington, a Brokers, Asset Managers and Exchanges equity analyst at J.P. Morgan, is joined by Teresa Ho, head of U.S. Short Duration Strategy, to explore the dynamic world of stablecoins. Together, they break down what stablecoins are, how they work and why they\u2019re gaining so much attention in today\u2019s financial landscape. The discussion covers how stablecoins differ from deposits and money market funds, the impact of recent legislation such as the GENIUS Act, as well as what all this could mean for the future of finance."

There\u2019s some disintermediation in the sense of the shift in the curve of total demand for Treasury assets.\nWhile short-term repos against long-term Treasuries likely don\u2019t transfer much of the duration risk of long-term Treasuries to the stablecoin, some of it could remain\u2014such as when 30-year bond prices fell by \u22488% in a week in March 2020 (particularly if stablecoin disclosure requirements are such that markets can see the collateral exposure).\nThe greater financial stability risk here is tying the supply of funding in money markets to crypto market cap. When cryptoasset market cap goes up, the supply of stablecoins needs to grow\u2014and vice versa.\nThat means that when crypto assets fall, money market funding is .

And certainly less so if it happens alongside a systemic event.\n\u201cDeposits in insured depository institutions\u201d is a common, unfortunate phrase, because it implies the institution is insured\u2014rather than deposits up to $250,000. (Yes, in a systemiccrisis, there are mechanisms by which larger amounts can be protected.)\nWe saw the risks to the stablecoin itself of holding reserves in banks when USDC was trading at less than 90 cents on the dollar while SVB\u2019s depositors\u2019 fate was uncertain; when they were rescued, redeeming USDC still faced  of USDC\u2019s bank deposit partners prior to March 2023 is surreal in hindsight\nHowever, this dynamic only turns stablecoins into a financial stability risk if they grow tremendously, such as along the lines of the Standard Chartered estimates.",
              "The greater financial stability risk here, even at current stablecoin market caps, is akin to that noted for Treasury-backed repos: the tying of senior financial system funding (deposits in this case) to crypto market cap. That it\u2019s typically been mid-sized banks servicing crypto means stablecoin (and other crypto) deposits can represent a material part of the funding profile (and the market\u2019s view of their )\u2014again, particularly if the stablecoin market grows.\nAnd, to the extent the stablecoin market grows by coming into its own as a retail payment product, stablecoins would be effectively gathering insured (stable) deposits and , uninsured deposits concentrated in the banks servicing these clients.\nBitcoin, commodities, foreign commercial paper, whatever. Ironically, this is the one with the least financial stability risk if the stablecoin market remains around its current size and with current transaction purposes, which are, so far,  beyond participating in the crypto ecosystem. Risky assets forming the backing reserve has the least financial stability risk because stablecoin market cap can ebb and flow dramatically in this world and only affect the markets for risk assets, rather than systemically important funding markets.\nIf, however, nonbank stablecoins become a $1T+ market used for mainly real-economy transactions, then there\u2019s financial stability risk in the  losing any money, and you don\u2019t want this risky stuff backing any par liabilities that aren\u2019t issued by a regulated bank. Avoiding the risks in holding these kinds of assets has seemed to be Congress\u2019s primary motivation since it began drafting stablecoin bills.

These include the following:\n  * Delays in settlement of one to three business days are common when using traditional payment rails, especially when sending payments cross-border.\n  * Traditional payment processing typically involves multiple intermediaries (for example, correspondent banks and clearing houses); as a result, this process can generate multiple fees.\n  * Complex legacy infrastructure can obscure the routing and status of payments, especially during international transfers.\n  * Payment systems reliant on the traditional banking system usually only operate during business hours, which do not include weekends and holidays.\n  * Since much of the traditional payments infrastructure relies on banks, many people are underserved or excluded by KYC regulations and face other access hurdles such as the need for a state-issued ID or multiple proofs of residence.",

              "## How do stablecoins impact cross-border business payments compared to traditional methods? \nStablecoins most clearly outperform traditional payments when it comes to cross-border transactions.\nInternational wire transfers move via the network. A payment might pass through five or more correspondent banks, each taking a cut and delaying settlement. Funds can spend up to a week in transit with little visibility into where they are at any given moment. Costs add up quickly through up-front charges, extra fees per intermediary, and a percentage in FX spread. To mitigate them, companies often prefund accounts abroad, which ties up working capital. In some markets, local cards or banks simply can\u2019t connect internationally, which excludes entire customer segments.\nA stablecoin transfer removes the intermediaries, goes directly from sender to recipient, and is visible in real time on a public ledger. Settlement takes minutes, and blockchain costs are low. Contractors or vendors in can receive digital dollars even without a US bank account. In countries with volatile currencies, stablecoins can hold the steady value that local systems can\u2019t provide.\nStablecoins can reduce costs, open up new customer bases, and remove the opacity that has long plagued international money movement.\n## What are the compliance and regulatory considerations for stablecoins compared to traditional payments? \nTraditional payment networks follow mature rulebooks. Banks enforce Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, card networks build in consumer protections, and regulators have had decades to refine oversight. Banks and processors typically handle compliance.",
              "Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to a real-world asset, often a fiat currency such as the US dollar (USD) or , and are designed to hold steady value. One , for example, is designed to always equal roughly one dollar because it\u2019s backed by USD reserves. Businesses use stablecoins because they combine crypto\u2019s speed and reach with fiat\u2019s predictability.\nA typical payment works like this: a customer sends stablecoins from their digital wallet to the business\u2019s wallet and settlement occurs within minutes. There are no bank cutoff times and no pending statuses. Companies can keep the tokens for future payments or instantly convert them into local currency through a provider like .\n## What are the traditional payment methods in business? \nBusinesses still regularly move money through familiar networks: cards, bank transfers, and\u2014to a lesser extent\u2014cash or checks. Traditional networks are well known and universal but are generally slower, subject to higher fees, and restricted by banking hours. Here\u2019s a closer look at each method:\n  * These transactions depend on like Visa and Mastercard, with issuing banks, acquiring banks, and processors in the mix. The purchase feels instant to the customer, but businesses usually wait 1\u20133 days for settlement and pay a percentage of the transaction amount plus a flat fee.\n  * Making transfers through your bank is inexpensive but can take days. Wire transfers are faster but involve higher fees and sometimes hidden foreign exchange markups. Payments that are routed through multiple correspondent banks can take up to a week.\n  * While cash and checks are still used in some markets, they\u2019re costly to handle and painfully slow to clear.",
              "## How do stablecoin payments work for businesses compared to traditional payments? \nFundamentally, both and traditional payments do the same thing: they move value from the customer to the business. But stablecoins are an internet-native payment method with instant finality, while traditional methods rely on legacy institutions, intermediaries, and multiday settlement. Here\u2019s how each payment type works.\nA business provides a digital wallet address. The customer sends the agreed amount. Within minutes, the tokens settle on a blockchain and land in the business\u2019s wallet. The transfer is visible on a public network and it can\u2019t be reversed once it\u2019s confirmed. There are no bank intermediaries or cutoff times for processing. The business can hold stablecoins to pay suppliers or hedge against local volatility, or it can instantly convert them to local currency through an exchange or processor.\nCard flows run through layers, from the payment processor to the to the card network to the issuing bank. The business receives authorization instantly, but funds settle in batches a few days later. Direct deposits are slower still: domestic wire transfers can be same-day, but international ones often take days and pass through multiple correspondent banks. Some of these systems allow reversals (e.g., chargebacks on cards).\n## How do stablecoins compare to traditional payments on speed and settlement? \nStablecoins settle at internet speed. A transfer usually clears within seconds or minutes at any time of day, any day of the year. There are no cutoff times and no bank holidays. The payment is final once it\u2019s confirmed on the chain and it\u2019s irreversible like cash payment.\nTraditional systems are comparatively sluggish. Cards and take 1\u20133 business days.

              "Stablecoins: An Alternative Payment Method for Merchants?\nA new wave of payment innovation is upon us, and it is fueled, at least in part, by digital-first consumers\u2019 and merchants\u2019 concerns about the rising costs of traditional payment methods. Stablecoins, which are digital assets capable of being redeemed for a fixed amount of monetary value, stand out as one such innovative payment method that reduces friction by allowing lower costs and faster settlement for merchants, all without the need to rely on traditional payment card networks. There\u2019s a rumor that several large merchants are exploring issuing their own stablecoins as an alternative payment method to reduce acceptance costs. And the [recently passed Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/insights/newsletters/2025/07/newsletters-practices-dcb-digital-currency-blockchain-q2-2025) provides a regulatory regime that could expand the adoption of stablecoins as alternative pay.",
              "A key driver to the adoption of stablecoins as an alternative payment is the elimination of the costs inherent in accepting traditional payment cards. Most merchants pay transaction and interchange fees \u2014 which may vary depending on the type of merchant, the type of transaction (e.g., card present or not present), and the card type \u2014 as a condition to acceptance of traditional payment cards (e.g., Amex, Mastercard, and Visa). Merchants\u2019 obligation to honor all cards, coupled with surcharging restrictions, have left merchants with little flexibility when it comes to acceptance costs, unless the merchant has a separate incentive arrangement with a card payment network to reduce acceptance costs. Because stablecoins operate on blockchain networks, direct transactions between a merchant and a customer can occur with minimal or no involvement from traditional financial institutions, which will eliminate the need for many acceptance fees and potentially introduce other inherent cost savings for merchants (e.g., reserve requirements and chargeback risks). \nBecause of their use of blockchain technology, stablecoins also significantly reduce settlement times associated with traditional payment rails by \n  * bypassing intermediaries in the clearing process, including many of the players in the current payment infrastructure (e.g., networks, issuing banks, acquiring banks, processors); \n  * offering 24-7 availability, reducing delays based on time zones, weekends, and holidays; and\n  * reducing reconciliation time due to the use of a public ledger.",
              "Stablecoins, therefore, satisfy the increasing demand for instant settlement, particularly in an increasingly global marketplace. \nEven with these benefits, however, the lack of a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins may impede wider adoption by merchants and consumers alike.\n## The Promise of the GENIUS Act\nThe GENIUS Act, which establishes the first federal regulatory framework specifically for the issuance and use of payment stablecoins, passed in the Senate and the House with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Trump on July 18, 2025. Among other requirements, the GENIUS Act requires issuers to provide a full reserve for dollar-backed stablecoins and to provide monthly public disclosures and audited financial statements. Stablecoin issuers will also be subject to the Bank Secrecy Act for anti-money laundering and related purposes and would be subject to oversight by federal or state regulators. \nThe passage of the GENIUS Act represents a significant step forward with the broader adoption of stablecoins, and blockchain more generally, across the payments space. Payment providers like PayPal and Stripe already support stablecoin transactions, and other platforms are expected to soon follow. And while merchants may be initially hesitant to embrace this alternative payment method, any up-front investment required to integrate this technology will be substantially outweighed by the benefits of stablecoins, which present the opportunity to improve both the customer experience and the merchant\u2019s bottom line.\nWe practice in every fintech vertical, including payments, deposits, lending, digital assets, and alternative finance. \n_This informational piece, which may be considered advertising under the ethical rules of certain jurisdictions, is provided on the understanding that it does not constitute the rendering of legal advice or other professional advice by Goodwin or its lawyers.

              "Stablecoins offer users several advantages. For starters, they are designed to maintain a stable value, making them less volatile than other cryptocurrencies. They are also programmable, which means they can be automatically managed and controlled. This makes them a relatively reliable medium of exchange within the blockchain universe.\n\u201cStablecoins are a digital, on-chain form of fiat money. They are easy to self-custody and transact, and they are also fast, particularly in the context of cross-border money movement. One could even consider them a better form than fiat, as they can move quicker and less expensively across existing financial infrastructure in certain circumstances,\u201d Worthington said. As such, they are well-suited for the traditional financial services system, where the movement of cash needs to keep pace with transactions that are increasingly executed outside of usual business hours.\nOn the flip side, stablecoins could pose a threat to financial stability. For instance, stablecoins could have significant run risks, in which a large group of investors redeem their holdings simultaneously. \u201cThe collapse of TerraUSD in May 2022 highlights just how quickly a run can occur, in an asset class that trades 24/7,\u201d Ho remarked. The effects of a massive liquidation could spill over to other markets, destabilizing the traditional banking system.\nIn addition, the [Bank for International Settlements (BIS)](https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2025e3.htm) posits that stablecoins fall short on three key tests for money:\n  * Stablecoins that are traded in secondary markets might be exchanged at a slight deviation from par with the fiat currency they are pegged to.\n  * The issuer\u2019s balance sheet cannot be expanded at will, and any additional supply of stablecoins would require full upfront payment by its holders."

          "answer": "**Economic Implications of Adopting a Stablecoin as an Official Digital Currency in the U.S.**\n\n**Introduction**  \nA stablecoin is a type of digital currency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset such as the U.S. dollar or short-term government securities. If adopted as an official digital currency, a U.S. stablecoin would become a formal component of the nation\u2019s monetary architecture, bridging blockchain innovation with traditional finance. This policy step could transform how money circulates, how the Federal Reserve manages monetary policy, and how efficiently payment systems operate. This report examines the potential macroeconomic and systemic effects, as well as impacts on payment efficiency and inclusivity.\n\n**Financial Stability and Monetary Policy Implications**  \nIntroducing an official U.S. stablecoin could improve overall financial efficiency by speeding up transactions, lowering costs, and increasing the transparency of financial operations[1]. By integrating with Treasury and money markets, such a stablecoin could also bring stability to the demand for short-term securities, potentially reducing volatility in these important funding markets[2]. However, this integration would fundamentally shift liquidity dynamics and the way government funding conditions are managed.\n\nThe primary risks include liquidity and redemption challenges\u2014if large-scale redemptions occur, they could force asset sales, raise yields, and amplify broader financial stress[3][4]. Embedding a stablecoin framework within the Federal Reserve could mitigate some of these run risks but might blur operational boundaries between monetary policy execution and payment management[1]. Meanwhile, the global use of a U.S. stablecoin could enhance the dollar\u2019s international dominance; yet, it might provoke reactions from other nations concerned about currency sovereignty and cross-border regulatory oversight[5]. Overall, while the Federal Reserve could gain more granular visibility into money movement, its traditional policy tools might face new complexities in controlling liquidity and interest rates.\n\n**Payment System Efficiency and Financial Inclusivity**  \nFrom a payments perspective, an official stablecoin offers clear benefits. It would enable near-instant settlement, as blockchain transactions process continuously without dependence on banking hours or intermediaries[1][2]. Transaction costs would likely fall due to the elimination of multiple middlemen and lower foreign exchange spreads[1][2][3]. The distributed ledger design ensures all transactions are recorded transparently, enhancing verification processes and reducing reconciliation errors[1][2][3].  \nFurthermore, programmable smart contracts could automate payments, further improving operational efficiency for both individuals and institutions[1][3][4]. A major social benefit would be increased financial inclusivity\u2014people without traditional bank accounts could engage in digital payments via mobile wallets, empowering both unbanked and underbanked populations[1][2]. However, these gains would require investments in digital infrastructure and data protection to safeguard user privacy and system reliability.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nIn sum, designating a stablecoin as the U.S. official digital currency would carry both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, it promises a more efficient, inclusive, and transparent financial system. On the other, it introduces systemic risks that could complicate liquidity management and blur the limits of monetary policy authority. Policymakers would need to balance the potential for lower transaction costs and faster payments against the imperative of preserving financial stability and regulatory clarity. If well-designed and embedded under prudent oversight, a U.S. stablecoin could enhance economic resilience and innovation\u2014but without careful calibration, it might also magnify volatility and constrain traditional policy tools.\n\n**References:** [1][2][3][4][5]"

              ". In all of these arenas, banks and nonbanks will compete, and the question of whether federal and state standards are actually equivalent figures to be a live question for years to come. Even where banks, nonbanks, and state charters will be subject to equivalent stablecoin issuance regulatory regimes, banks and bank holding companies will be starting from a place of heightened regulatory restrictions \u2014 with supervision, capital, liquidity, management, activity, and affiliate transaction requirements that nonbanks do not have. Moreover, nonbank digital assets companies may have more experience and technical know-how in blockchain markets and applications that make them better suited to many roles within the payment stablecoin ecosystem. And, of course, banks, as depository institutions, may operate as service providers to payment stablecoin issuers, for example, as providers of deposit reserves and custody services, while developing other new services to, and partnerships with, digital asset companies and other nonbanks. Finally, it appears that agency rulemaking will play a significant role in the stablecoin regulatory landscape in the coming months and years, and we expect affected parties will seek to make their voices heard through rulemaking and congressional oversight.",

              "Stablecoins present macro considerations as well. For one, their increased use in money laundering and terrorist financing poses risks to national security. In addition, increased holdings of stablecoins by the public could potentially draw down bank deposits and thereby limit the efficacy of monetary policy. On the other hand, if issuers hold cash reserves as deposits and steer new cash into banks, such as from unbanked or foreign populations, stablecoin uptake may increase deposits and enhance the transmission of monetary policy. The composition of reserves also has implications for public finance\u2014U.S. Treasury securities, not cash, [are currently the favored reserve asset](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2025/04/stablecoins-and-crypto-shocks-an-update/) of the largest stablecoin issuers, who are already as significant holders of Treasury bills as the largest U.S. money market funds. Continued stablecoin growth could therefore bolster demand for government debt, not to mention the global dominance of the dollar, which is overwhelmingly the peg of choice among tokens currently in circulation.\n## How are stablecoins regulated in the US?",
              "In July 2025, Congress passed the , which [establishes a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/stablecoins-issues-for-regulators-as-they-implement-genius-act/). Similar to the U.S.\u2019s dual banking system, stablecoin issuers may apply for approval from either federal or (if total issuance is below $10 billion) state regulators in states where such regulation exists. Issuers must back their stablecoins one-to-one with reserves of cash or other permitted assets\u2014such as Treasury securities, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, government money market funds, bank deposits, or tokenized versions of the same\u2014and must report monthly on the composition of their reserves. Issuers will also be subject to federal anti-money laundering regulations. Their stablecoins, which cannot pay interest, must be redeemable for a fixed monetary value. The law designates the Treasury\u2019s Comptroller of the Currency as the federal regulator for nonbank issuers, whereas bank subsidiaries that wish to issue stablecoins will be regulated by the applicable state or federal bank regulators. State and federal regulators have until July 2026 to finalize implementation rules, including stablecoins\u2019 tax characterization, standards for foreign stablecoins sold in the U.S., and policies regarding conflicts of interest for stablecoin issuers, an issue of public debate [given the Trump family\u2019s growing business in crypto assets](https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/09/02/trump-world-liberty-financial-crypto-blockchain-token-wealth-bitcoin/). The law does not cover what it terms \u201cnon-payment stablecoins,\u201d which include algorithmic stablecoins, and remain in the purview of state regulators.",
              "Previously, all stablecoins were regulated and supervised as money transmitters, primarily at the state level. Many state governments [have applied existing rules, and some have passed new laws](https://stevenscenter.wharton.upenn.edu/publications-50-state-review/), to subject issuers and exchangers of crypto assets to regulations for consumer protection and financial soundness. Money transmitters are required to register with the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which in 2013 clarified that reporting requirements for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) [apply equally to the transmission of crypto assets](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/guidance/application-fincens-regulations-persons-administering). Banks, for their part, needed special permission under Biden administration policies to custody crypto assets, hold reserves for stablecoin issuers as deposits, and participate in blockchains, but the Comptroller of the Currency [reversed this policy in March 2025](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-16.html).\nIn 2015, the New York Division of Financial Services\u2014an early mover on crypto regulation\u2014began requiring businesses engaged in any of several activities involving crypto assets to and comply with standards including capital requirements, AML programs, and consumer protection. New York first approved the issuance of stablecoins by licensees in 2018, and in 2022 [clarified that licensees issuing U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins must hold full reserves](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20220608_issuance_stablecoins) of highly safe and liquid assets, publish monthly attestations of reserve adequacy by independent accountants, and redeem stablecoins for reserves in a timely fashion under clearly disclosed policies."

All issuers fall under the Bank Secrecy Act, making AML/CFT and sanctions compliance non-negotiable.\n  * Payment stablecoins are carved out from securities and commodities law, removing them from SEC and CFTC jurisdiction and squarely placing oversight with banking regulators.",
              "The impact on the market has been immediate Coinbase, Circle, and other US-linked issuers are seen as compliance winners, while offshore or under-collateralised tokens face significant pressure. There is reason to think the Treasury could benefit too: mandatory T-bill reserves mean stablecoin issuers may become major buyers of government debt, reinforcing dollar demand globally. Critics, however, warn of financial-stability spillovers \u2014 if redemptions force mass Treasury sales, yields could spike.\nThe EU introduced its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) in 2024. It sets out a licensing regime for issuers of \u201casset-referenced tokens\u201d and \u201ce-money tokens\u201d, with strict requirements on capital, governance, and reserve management. MiCA also allows regulators to restrict non-euro stablecoins if their use exceeds 1 million transactions and EUR 200 million per day, a safeguard aimed at protecting monetary sovereignty. While the regime creates compliance costs, it also offers legal certainty, potentially boosting adoption among institutional users. For global issuers, however, the euro-centric design presents strategic challenges.\n## United Kingdom: Integrating into FSMA\nThe UK is in the process of bringing stablecoins under existing payments and e-money legislation via amendments to the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA), with draft rules under consultation. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will oversee compliance, while the Bank of England will supervise systemic stablecoins. The Treasury has made clear that privately issued stablecoins can play a role in payments, provided they meet operational resilience and redemption standards. This pragmatic approach aligns with the UK\u2019s ambition to be a digital finance hub, but details of secondary legislation and supervisory intensity remain to be tested.",
              "These themes reflect regulators\u2019 balancing act: encouraging innovation while safeguarding monetary stability.\nStablecoins remain a small section of the wider cryptocurrency market, but recent regulatory developments give reason to think their share may grow. Whilst cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are speculative assets, stablecoins\u2019 reduced volatility makes them more viable as a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account.\nNew rules generally raise barriers to entry. Smaller issuers may exit or partner with regulated institutions, while larger players with balance-sheet capacity consolidate market share. This mirrors patterns seen in e-money and payments regulation over the past decade.\nBanks and established PSPs are entering the stablecoin arena, either by issuing tokens directly or by providing custody and reserve services. This could erode the first-mover advantage of crypto-native firms and tilt the market towards regulated incumbents.\nMiCA\u2019s daily transaction cap on non-euro stablecoins could limit the use of USD-backed coins in Europe, potentially fragmenting money flow. Conversely, the clarity provided by the framework may encourage the development of euro-denominated alternatives. With the GENIUS Act, the US has removed much of the regulatory uncertainty that previously pushed innovation abroad. While smaller issuers may still find compliance burdens heavy, larger players now have a clearer pathway to operate domestically.\nThe lack of harmonisation complicates cross-border payments. A stablecoin fully compliant in Singapore may fall foul of MiCA caps or US banking rules. For multinational PSPs, this means higher legal complexity, compliance costs, and operational risk."

Stablecoins have also long been a lynchpin of cryptocurrency transactions, allowing users to move relatively easily from cryptocurrency to \u201cfiat\u201d through a stablecoin and then back into a different cryptocurrency.\nUse of stablecoins in connection with cryptocurrency transactions has been highly successful. In 2024, total stablecoin transfer volume was US$27.6 trillion, almost all of it used for digital asset transactions, and its market capitalization grew to US$150 billion. However, adoption of these digital assets for cross-border transactions or for retail payments has been slow, due in large part to uncertainty as to how stablecoins would be regulated. Recently, however, the regulatory landscape has become much clearer, particularly in the United States, paving the way for widespread adoption of stablecoins. In this chapter, we provide some background on stablecoins, and then an analysis of the current state of stablecoin regulation in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and Hong Kong.",

The law also provides for recognition of foreign-issued stablecoins if they are subject to regulatory and supervisory requirements that are \u201ccomparable\u201d to those applicable to PPSIs, as determined by the Treasury Secretary upon a recommendation from each other member of the SCRC.\nSignificantly, if a payment stablecoin is not issued by a PPSI, then it cannot be: (i) treated as cash or cash equivalent for accounting purposes; (ii) eligible as cash or cash equivalent margin or collateral for broker-dealers, swap dealers, and certain other intermediaries; or (iii) accepted as a settlement asset to facilitate wholesale payments between banking organizations.\nUnder the GENIUS Act, so-called \u201cdigital asset service providers\u201d (, digital asset intermediaries, exchanges and custodians) will be generally prohibited from offering or selling payment stablecoins that are not issued by a PPSI beginning on July 18, 2028. In addition, they are prohibited from offering, selling or otherwise making available a payment stablecoin issued by a foreign stablecoin issuer unless such issuer has the technological capability to comply, and will comply, with the terms of any lawful order to seize, freeze, burn, or prevent the transfer of outstanding stablecoins, among other requirements.\n### Principal requirements for licensed stablecoin issuers\nThe GENIUS Act sets forth a number compliance and other requirements for stablecoin issuers.

Binance Holdings Ltd., No. 1:23-cv-01599 (D.D.C. June 28, 2024), ECF No. 248.\nSignificant variation exists in state-level regulation of stablecoins. Across the country, money transmission laws apply to stablecoin-related activities. However, some states, such as New York, offer specific guidance or entire regulatory regimes tailored for stablecoins. New York pioneered the BitLicense in 2015, which operates as a license and charter-based system for digital assets. \nSuch a license is required to conduct a digital asset business in New York. In June 2022, New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) released guidance on issuing U.S. dollar\u2013backed stablecoins. \nIndustry Guidance, Adrienne A. Harris, Superintendent of Fin. Servs., N.Y. Dep\u2019t of Fin. Servs., [Guidance on the Issuance of U.S. Dollar\u2013Backed Stablecoins](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20220608_issuance_stablecoins) (June 8, 2022).\nThe guidance applies to U.S. dollar\u2013backed stablecoin issuers licensed under a BitLicense or chartered as limited-purpose trust companies under New York banking law. The guidance creates \u201crecommendations or principles\u201d related to redeemability, reserves, and attestation (confirmation of accounting statements). Stablecoin issuers must hold at least a 1:1 ratio of reserves segregated from other assets, and the reserves must be highly liquid.",
              "The reserves are subject to NYDFS approval and may only be comprised of \u201cU.S. Treasury bills acquired by the Issuer three months or less from their respective maturities\u201d; \u201cReverse repurchase agreements fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes, and/or U.S. Treasury bonds on an overnight basis\u201d; \u201cGovernment money-market funds\u201d; or \u201cDeposit accounts at U.S. state or federally chartered depository institutions.\u201d Issuers must adopt clear redemption policies that allow for timely redemption (not more than two full business days) at par value. Moreover, stablecoin issuers must release public attestations monthly that a third-party accountant verifies. NYDFS issued these requirements as guidance, not rules. However, the guidance states that \u201c[i]ssuers that currently issue U.S. dollar\u2013backed stablecoins under DFS supervision are expected to come into compliance with this Guidance within three months of the date hereof.\u201d \nAlthough there are many differences in jurisdictional approaches to stablecoin regulation, some common regulatory principles emerge:\n  1. Stablecoin issuances require explicit regulatory approval by the appropriate regulator.\n  2. Reserves must be liquid and stable, ensuring that they can cover all issued stablecoins on a 1:1 basis.\n  3. Stablecoin payment services must align with existing financial regulations, offering protections akin to traditional currency-based payment systems. \nCryptocurrency companies in the U.S. are already subject to all state-based money-service business laws and must register as a money services business (MSB) in any state in which they operate.",

Many stablecoins have experienced market price fluctuation.\n  * Some foreign jurisdictions have passed laws regulating stablecoins. The EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) categorizes stablecoins into electronic money tokens (EMTs) and asset-referenced tokens (ARTs). The UK framework categorizes stablecoin payments as hybrid or pure.\n  * The U.S. lacks comprehensive federal legislation, but certain existing regulations apply. Significant variation exists in state-level regulation of stablecoins. New York pioneered the BitLicense in 2015, which operates as a license and charter-based system for digital assets.\n  * Common principles include the following: stablecoin issuances require explicit regulatory approval; reserves must be liquid and stable, ensuring that they can cover all issued stablecoins on a 1:1 basis; and stablecoin payment services must align with existing financial regulations."

Singapore\u2019s framework requires exclusive local issuance for regulated status, while Hong Kong\u2019s regime asserts extraterritorial jurisdiction over HKD-pegged stablecoins globally.\nThe UK\u2019s developing framework appears most aligned with U.S. principles, though final rules remain pending.\nJapan requires institutional partnerships between issuers and banks or trust companies, representing a more restrictive model. Switzerland maintains a guidance-based approach offering flexibility but less legal certainty.\nThe GENIUS Act\u2019s comparable regime provisions may open opportunities for regulatory reciprocity, particularly with jurisdictions adopting similar prudential standards. However, initial determinations will likely prove restrictive given the unanimous approval requirement and high U.S. standards.\nSection 15 of the GENIUS Act further directs the Federal Reserve and Treasury to pursue reciprocal agreements with foreign jurisdictions, indicating congressional intent to eventually harmonize global stablecoin standards beyond the narrow comparable regime framework.\n## Other Key Takeaways for Market Participants\nExisting Stablecoin Issuers should immediately assess their path to compliance, determining whether federal or state licensing best suits their business model. Reserve portfolios require realignment to permitted assets, and operational infrastructure needs significant enhancement to meet disclosure and technical requirements.\nFinancial Institutions should evaluate opportunities in stablecoin issuance, leveraging existing regulatory relationships and infrastructure advantages.

          "answer": "**Report: Regulatory Challenges and Policy Frameworks for U.S. Stablecoin Adoption**\n\n**Introduction**  \nStablecoins\u2014digital assets pegged to stable reserve assets like the U.S. dollar\u2014present opportunities for faster payments, enhanced financial inclusion, and innovation in digital finance. However, their proliferation also poses systemic and regulatory challenges, including financial stability risks, consumer protection concerns, and uncertainty over jurisdictional oversight. In the U.S., achieving broad adoption hinges on developing a coherent, comprehensive regulatory and policy framework to address these concerns while fostering innovation.\n\n---\n\n**Regulatory Oversight**  \nThe emerging U.S. regulatory model, formalized under the proposed GENIUS Act, envisions a multi-agency structure for stablecoin supervision. The U.S. Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) would serve as the primary federal overseers [1][2]. The OCC would supervise federally chartered entities and qualified payment stablecoin issuers, while the Federal Reserve and FDIC would oversee insured depository institutions and set prudential standards for their stablecoin subsidiaries [1].  \n\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) would continue enforcing anti\u2013money laundering and counter\u2013terrorism financing provisions under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) [2][3]. State regulators\u2014such as the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)\u2014would maintain oversight of smaller or state-licensed issuers through money transmitter licensing and reserve requirement regimes [4]. This creates a dual oversight model that blends federal consistency with state-level consumer protection.\n\n---\n\n**Legislative Gaps and Statutory Reforms**  \nA key statutory evolution under the GENIUS Act involves the reclassification of \u201cpayment stablecoins.\u201d This reform would clarify that such instruments are not securities or commodities, thereby excluding them from SEC and CFTC jurisdiction and consolidating supervision within banking regulators [3]. This delineation aims to remove overlapping oversight and reduce regulatory arbitrage.  \n\nNonetheless, challenges persist. Uniform reserve standards, redemption rights, and consistent capital requirements across both bank and nonbank issuers require further legislative specification. Similarly, while the BSA framework applies to stablecoin transactions, enforcement capabilities for decentralized or algorithmic variants remain ambiguous.\n\n---\n\n**International Comparison and Lessons**  \nIn contrast to the United States, other major jurisdictions have established more centralized and uniform regulatory approaches:\n\n- **European Union (MiCA framework):** The EU implements a single licensing regime under the European Banking Authority and member-state supervisors. MiCA mandates full reserve backing, capital and governance requirements, environmental disclosures, and clearly defined redemption rights [EU comparison]. Compared with the U.S. dual-tier model, the EU framework offers stronger integration with existing financial infrastructure and pan-European licensing that reduces regulatory fragmentation [1][6].\n\n- **Japan (Payment Services Providers Law):** Japan\u2019s Financial Services Agency (FSA) centralizes oversight of stablecoin issuance, restricting it to licensed banks, trust companies, and money transmitters [2]. Full fiat-backed reserves, redemption guarantees at par value, and explicit registration and AML/KYC obligations for intermediaries ensure high consumer confidence [2][3][6]. Japan\u2019s approach contrasts sharply with the U.S. federal-state dynamic, providing more direct accountability under a single national supervisor.\n\nThese international examples demonstrate the benefits of consolidated regulatory authority, consistent reserve and redemption policies, and clear legal classification of stablecoins as digital equivalents of fiat money rather than speculative assets.\n\n---\n\n**Key Challenges and Policy Recommendations**  \nSynthesizing the U.S. and international perspectives highlights the core regulatory challenges impeding widespread stablecoin adoption:\n\n1. **Fragmented Oversight:** Multiple U.S. regulators\u2014federal and state\u2014create overlapping jurisdiction and compliance burdens [1][2][4].  \n2. **Unclear Legal Classification:** The current uncertainty over whether stablecoins are securities, commodities, or payment instruments inhibits market confidence [3].  \n3. **Inconsistent Standards:** Varied reserve, capital, and redemption frameworks across issuers prevent interoperability and uniform consumer protection [1][2].  \n4. **Limited Global Coordination:** Without equivalence regimes like those under MiCA, cross-border operations face regulatory uncertainty [1][5][6].\n\n**Policy Framework Path Forward:**  \n- Establish a unified federal charter for payment stablecoin issuers under the OCC to ensure consistent prudential oversight.  \n- Mandate 1:1 reserve backing and periodic attestations, modeled after MiCA and Japan\u2019s PSP standards.  \n- Clarify federal-state regulatory boundaries to minimize redundancy, similar to Japan\u2019s single-agency structure.  \n- Develop reciprocal supervisory agreements with the EU and Japan to support cross-border compliance and mutual recognition [1][6].  \n- Incorporate technological resilience, cybersecurity standards, and open-access protocols into the regulatory design to future-proof policy implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**  \nFor stablecoins to achieve mainstream adoption in the United States, policymakers must resolve the existing fragmentation in oversight and align statutory reforms with clear, globally harmonized standards. Lessons from MiCA and Japan\u2019s PSP approach demonstrate the value of coherent national frameworks that integrate consumer protection, financial stability, and innovation under one regulatory umbrella. The U.S. will benefit from adopting a similar unified model\u2014anchored in transparency, interoperability, and risk-based oversight\u2014to promote safe and sustainable stablecoin growth within the broader financial system [1][2][3][4][5][6]."

Stablecoins offer speed, transparency and 24/7 settlement, but they also come with regulatory requirements and operational risks. Industry leaders embed compliance from day one integrating KYC/AML checks, travel-rule data sharing, and transaction monitoring directly into their payment stacks.\nIn practice, \u201cstablecoin compliance\u201d means meeting the same regulatory standards as traditional finance: rigorous identity verification, on-chain transaction scrutiny, and adherence to global laws. By prioritizing compliance early, businesses earn the trust of banks and regulators and unlock the full potential of blockchain-based enterprise payments.\nBuilding trust with stablecoins requires addressing several core requirements:\n  * \u2014 Verified onboarding of wallet users. Enterprises must use robust identity checks (government IDs, biometrics, proof-of-address) and link those credentials to blockchain addresses. Some solutions now offer \u201con-chain KYC,\u201d where cryptographic attestations of a user\u2019s verified identity are anchored on-chain without exposing personal data. This lets compliant users transact permissionlessly while signaling their KYC status to smart contracts. As Fireblocks notes, firms should implement workflows that \u201cverify identities through documentation and biometrics\u201d and perform dynamic risk assessments (behavioral analysis, device fingerprinting, geolocation checks) during onboarding.",
              "Secure custody builds confidence with regulators and partners. It also safeguards the business itself: as McKinsey notes, losing keys or reserve control can undermine the entire stablecoin project, even if the blockchain protocol is sound.\n## Smart Contracts, APIs and Integration\nA compliant stablecoin infrastructure also relies on . Smart contracts must be securely written and audited, and enterprise systems (bank ledgers, ERP, CRM) need API connectivity to the crypto rails.\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n_Diagram of enterprise smart contract architecture showing modular compliance hooks and API integration with payment systems (Source: Kaleido)_\n  * Every token contract or payment contract should undergo a rigorous security review before deployment. Auditors can verify that the contract has no logic errors and properly incorporates compliance checks. For example, a contract might include functions or modifiers that automatically block transfers involving non-verified addresses or blacklisted wallets. Embedding such checks at the code level can a transaction at the moment it violates policy.\n  * Architect the system so that KYC/AML components are modular and pluggable. For instance, a payment API might call out to an external compliance engine before executing any transaction. This way, updates to global sanctions lists or local regulations can be integrated without redesigning the whole system.\n  * Use APIs and middleware to connect stablecoins with existing corporate treasury and payment systems. An enterprise-ready ledger should translate stablecoin transactions into the company\u2019s accounting system, update accounts payable/receivable, and trigger corporate controls (just like a SWIFT message would). This ensures stablecoins become a first-class asset in the enterprise finance stack."

              "The smart contract architecture of stablecoins extends beyond basic token functionality to include specialized features required for stability maintenance and regulatory compliance. Advanced stablecoin implementations incorporate features such as pause functionality for emergency situations, blacklist capabilities for regulatory compliance and upgrade \nmechanisms that allow issuers to modify contract behavior while maintaining token continuity. \nMulti-signature controls represent critical security features in stablecoin smart contracts, requiring multiple authorized parties to approve significant actions such as token minting, contract upgrades or emergency pauses. These controls help prevent single points of failure and provide additional security layers that are particularly important for institutional adoption and regulatory compliance. \nThe transparency characteristics of blockchain technology create both opportunities and challenges for stablecoin operations. While all transactions are publicly visible and verifiable, providing unprecedented transparency into stablecoin flows and usage patterns, this visibility also creates privacy considerations for institutional users if the transactions are on public blockchains, as opposed to private blockchains, and potential compliance challenges in jurisdictions with strict financial privacy requirements. \nThe multi-chain nature of modern blockchain infrastructure has led to the deployment of major stablecoins across multiple networks, each with distinct technical characteristics and trade-offs. for example, operates on over ten different blockchain networks including Ethereum, Tron, Polygon and Avalanche, with each deployment requiring separate technical integration and risk assessment [12].",
              "Cross-chain bridge technology enables the transfer of stablecoins between different blockchain networks, but these bridges represent additional technical and security risks that must be evaluated in institutional risk management frameworks. Bridge exploits have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, highlighting the importance of understanding cross-chain risks when evaluating multi-chain stablecoin strategies. In addition, the interoperability of the cryptoasset ecosystem means that bridge functionality allows bad actors to use this feature to obfuscate stablecoin transactions before it is off-ramped to fiat.\nThe governance structures of stablecoin protocols determine how technical parameters are adjusted, upgrades are implemented and emergency responses are coordinated. These governance mechanisms represent critical components of stablecoin systems that directly impact their long-term stability and adaptability to changing market conditions. \nDecentralized governance through token voting enables community control over protocol parameters but may also introduce decision-making delays and coordination challenges during crisis situations. The balance between decentralization and operational efficiency represents an ongoing challenge for stablecoin protocol design and a key consideration for institutional evaluation. \nEmergency response mechanisms, including pause functionality and emergency governance procedures, provide critical safeguards for stablecoin systems during extreme market conditions or security incidents. Understanding these mechanisms and their activation procedures is essential for institutional risk management and contingency planning."

For more recent commentary by Nellie Liang, read \nStablecoins continue to grow, and use cases are increasing. The vast majority are tied to the U.S. dollar, but the U.S. lacks a strong, consistent, and coherent regulatory framework. I describe below some essential features of a regulatory framework for the U.S. that would both support financial innovation and reduce serious risks, many of which were highlighted in in 2021 by the President\u2019s Working Group. Current financial regulations, mainly a diverse set of state money transmitter licensing requirements, are inadequate for significant stablecoins that operate across state and national borders, raise new and unique illicit finance risks, and threaten monetary and financial stability.\nStablecoins function as \u201cdigital cash\u201d issued by a private firm that is recorded and transferred on a blockchain rather than on the books and records of a commercial bank or central bank. The market value of stablecoins has grown from less than $20 billion in 2019 to more than $230 billion on a global basis in early 2025. Stablecoins currently are used mainly for trading crypto assets, although there is growing use of USD-based stablecoins in countries with less stable domestic currencies. Evidence points to increased use for terrorist financing and money laundering.",
              "to increase competition and efficiency of payments and capital markets activities as well as to support the global role of the dollar and U.S. national security. Stablecoins could make payments more efficient and available in real time as consumers increasingly demand faster, cheaper payments and businesses aim for efficiencies. For instance, blockchain rails could increase efficiency and innovation in cross-border payments and corporate treasury management as well as in merchant payments. The upside is greater if tokenization of securities becomes more widespread, since stablecoins would be a natural means of payment for securities transactions that are executed on-chain.\nBut stablecoins come with risks. From a financial stability perspective, they could be subject to runs if their value is not truly stable, and they could undermine the safety of payments if their operations are not robust to a range of operational and cyber threats. And their potential to scale rapidly because of network effects could increase risks to credit intermediation and monetary policy transmission if insured depository institutions lose significant deposits to stablecoins, or could lead to excessive concentration of power if stablecoins are issued by commercial firms. In addition, stablecoins present new and significant illicit financing risks since values can be transferred quickly across borders if actors are able to exploit weaknesses in international anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards. \nTo address the risks that stablecoins pose, a regulatory framework should include seven essential features:",
              "1. Reserve assets of a stablecoin issuer need to be ultra-safe and liquid if stablecoins are to function as money issued by a private firm. Because stablecoins do not have deposit insurance or access to a lender of last resort, they need to be backed by safe and liquid assets, like cash, Treasury bills, and central bank reserves, so they can offer convertibility at par. If assets with either credit or counterparty risk were to be permitted, the stablecoin issuer should be required to hold more capital and liquidity for those risks. Private money backed by risky assets with inadequate capital would be vulnerable to destabilizing runs and lose its ability to function as a medium of exchange.\n  2. Stablecoin issuers\u2019 activities should be limited to issuance and redemption (and ancillary activities), and issuers that achieve significant size should be subject to prudential federal regulations for capital, liquidity, and risk management calibrated to its limited activities. An issuer also should be subject to strong operational standards to ensure payment finality and reliability and its resilience to crypto, cyber, and other threats. In addition, stablecoin issuers should be subject to consumer protection rules that apply to similar payment products and services. At a minimum, the qualifications and integrity of an applicant should be considered when financial regulators consider granting a charter, either for a nonbank or a subsidiary of a depository institution.\n  3. Reserve assets of a stablecoin should be segregated and prioritized in bankruptcy, so that holders can still access their payment stablecoins if a stablecoin issuer were to fail. Clear rights to immediate redemption are needed for stablecoins of a failing issuer to prevent payment disruptions even as the issuer\u2019s liabilities are settled in bankruptcy over a longer period."

They could reshape how the government pays contractors. If adopted, these tools could be used to:\n  * Deliver real-time payments to vendors and subrecipients\n  * Cut foreign exchange costs for international projects\n  * Speed up disbursements for grants or disaster relief\n  * Maintain transparent, traceable records that meet audit requirements\n\nThis shift also helps preserve the dollar\u2019s global standing.

              "## How Payment Firms and Institutions Embed Stablecoins\nIntegrating stablecoins into a payments stack requires more than just adding a token, it means engaging with the underlying systems that make secure, compliant, and scalable digital asset operations possible. For firms building stablecoin-powered flows, success depends on a coordinated of custody, network access, APIs, and reconciliation systems.\nNot every institution begins with full-stack . Many start by partnering with third parties to access the rails. But over time, as internal expertise and regulatory clarity grow, firms move toward more direct control of custody, execution, and treasury. This transition, from C, is increasingly measured in months, not years.\nPlatforms that anticipate this journey, and architect for it early, gain the speed, margin, and resilience advantages that come from owning the payment flow.Here are four foundational components:\n### 1. Custody and Wallet Infrastructure\nStablecoins need to be securely held before they can move. Most payment firms implement either custodial or self-custodial wallet models, depending on their regulatory posture, internal expertise, and desired control.\n  * rely on regulated third parties to store assets and manage private keys.\n  * offers greater control but also requires robust key management, policy enforcement, and operational safeguards.\n\n  * Segregated wallets for clients or use cases\n  * Granular access control to mitigate operational risk\n  * Pre-transaction simulation and approval workflows\n  * Compatibility with internal ledgering and treasury systems",
              "Wallet orchestration is also essential, especially for platforms managing both corporate treasury and end-user balances within the same environment.\nStablecoin transactions settle on blockchain networks, each with distinct trade-offs in speed, cost, and ecosystem compatibility.\n  * \u2013 well-supported, highly secure, but relatively expensive\n  * , , \u2013 cost-effective and fast, often favored in emerging markets\n  * , , \u2013 optimized for specific geographies or use cases\n\n  * (signing, gas fees, execution)\n  * , as stablecoins often exist across multiple networks\n  * Interoperability tools to reduce fragmentation and support \n\nFirms often select multiple blockchains to balance reliability with regional cost-efficiency and latency needs.\n### 3. APIs for Checkout and Settlement\nTo make stablecoins usable at scale, they must plug directly into familiar payment and treasury workflows. This is typically done through APIs that abstract blockchain complexity and connect on-chain assets with front-end interfaces or back-office systems.\n  * Real-time merchant settlement or mass payouts\n  * Internal disbursements (e.g., payroll, affiliate commissions)\n\n  * Integrated conversion (e.g., auto-swap to fiat)\n  * Regulatory and KYC/KYB workflows behind the scenes\n\nSome firms embed these APIs into proprietary platforms; others rely on third-party orchestration to simplify implementation and compliance.\n### 4. Multi-Stablecoin Support, FX Management, and Reconciliation\nThe proliferation of fiat-backed stablecoins, USDC, PYUSD, EURC, FDUSD, and others, means payment platforms must manage multiple currencies and conversion pathways.\n  * Support for stablecoin-to-stablecoin and fiat-to-stablecoin FX\n  * Dynamic pricing and routing tools to optimize costs across venues and partners\n  * Automated reconciliation tools that map on-chain flows to internal ledgers or ERP systems",
              "Leading platforms integrate these capabilities with:\n  * Policy controls for approved currencies and corridors\n  * Reporting systems for audit and compliance needs\n  * Real-time visibility into wallet-level balances and flows\n\n## Risks and Challenges of Integrating Stablecoins into Payment Infrastructure\nWhile stablecoins offer speed, transparency, and programmable features that make them an attractive addition to modern payment systems, their integration introduces several structural and operational challenges. For payment firms and institutions, understanding and addressing these risks is essential to unlocking the full benefits of stablecoin-based payments.\n### 1. Regulatory Compliance and AML Requirements\nStablecoins exist at the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology, creating complexities for teams. Anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CTF), Know Your Customer (KYC), and Travel Rule requirements apply, but their enforcement varies widely across jurisdictions.\n  * Unlike centralized financial rails, blockchain-based stablecoin transactions are typically pseudonymous and irreversible, complicating regulatory enforcement.\n  * Firms must implement robust KYC/KYB procedures, monitor wallet activity in real time, and ensure compliance with global sanctions frameworks such as OFAC.\n  * Key vulnerabilities include on/off-ramps, unhosted wallets, and jurisdictional mismatches, which often fall into regulatory gray areas.\n  * Many regulators have responded with frameworks requiring enhanced due diligence, user verification, and pre-transaction compliance checks.\n  * The new FATF Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to collect and disclose specific customer data when transacting digital assets over a particular value threshold. Global jurisdictions currently have different disclosure and threshold requirements with varied enforcement."

Visa announced a stablecoin prefunding pilot through Visa Direct at SIBOS 2025, aimed at enabling faster business transactions. Tether unveiled USAT, a U.S.-based stablecoin designed to strengthen its presence in the U.S. market. Additionally, nine major European banks, including ING and UniCredit, have collaborated to explore or issue a new stablecoin, showcasing the growing interest from traditional financial institutions..\n## The Infrastructure Layer: What It Takes to Support Stablecoin Payments\nMaking stablecoin payments work for e-commerce requires more than just a blockchain. It needs a sophisticated technology stack that connects digital assets to the traditional financial world in a secure and compliant way.\nSeveral components are essential for building a robust system for stablecoin payments:\n  * Businesses need a safe place to hold their digital assets. must include enterprise-grade custody solutions, like multi-party computation (MPC) wallets, which protect funds from theft and unauthorized access. The settlement layer ensures that transactions are cleared and finalized reliably.\n  * For merchants to accept stablecoins, they need easy-to-integrate tools. Payment gateways and APIs act as the bridge, allowing e-commerce platforms to connect to blockchain networks without needing to build complex systems from scratch.\n  * To operate legally, payment providers must adhere to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. The best infrastructure for stablecoin payments integrates these compliance checks directly into the transaction flow, ensuring every payment is screened."

Our team has recently helped a implement an effective treasury management mechanism for maintaining appropriate liquidity levels of stablecoin and cryptocurrencies traded on the platform. It allows them to on/off-ramp crypto, enforce security, and automate transfer policies between different wallets.\nCompliance also sits squarely on your side. Every inbound and outbound transfer should be screened against sanctions lists and blockchain analytics tools to prevent illicit flows. One way to do this is via smart contracts.Most centralized stablecoins have embedded logic for on-chain checks. You can program automatic sender/receiver blacklist checks or a command to add or remove addresses from the blacklist based on the off-chain screening you do (e.g., as part of your general KYC/KYB process). Some stablecoins\u2014USDT, USDC, and BUSD\u2014also give functionality to destroy or seize tokens from blacklisted addresses.",

They were necessary in the early days, but have become increasingly cumbersome (and to an extent unnecessary) in the digital finance age.\nStablecoin payments flow over blockchains, which are credibly neutral, auditable, composable, and designed to scale globally. Meaning you can keep full audit trails and add custom controls to prevent fraud or KYC\u2014all while benefiting from an already existing and widely adopted technology, linking people everywhere, just like an email.\nFor individuals, it means accessible, instant, and transparent money movement. For businesses, that translates into better cash flow predictability, smoother working capital management, and far fewer reconciliation headaches.\nAnd this opens up a new pane of use cases.\nThe global remittances stood at last year, with one billion people using some money transfer service. But the experience is far from great. Fees are high, and transfers take a long time to get routed.\nStablecoins eliminate the chain of correspondent banks by moving value directly on-chain, enabling transfers in seconds at a fraction of the cost of traditional remittance services."

It draws upon findings regarding the foundational technical requirements for a secure and scalable U.S. official stablecoin and the capacity for integration with existing banking and payment systems. The goal is to determine whether current technologies and infrastructures can support such a deployment or whether substantial improvements are required.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Technological Infrastructure**\n\nThe deployment of a U.S. official stablecoin would demand an advanced and resilient technological foundation. Key requirements include a **secure wallet infrastructure**, featuring multiparty computation (MPC) wallets and real-time reconciliation systems to safeguard assets and align holdings with institutional frameworks [Child 1]. Robust **reserve and liquidity management systems** are needed to ensure a 1:1 backing in high-quality liquid assets with transparent, third-party audits and legally segregated reserves [Child 1].  \n\nFurther, the architecture must include **compliance and monitoring capabilities**, such as automated Travel Rule enforcement, AML/KYT screening, and continuous auditing to meet regulatory expectations [Child 1]. **Governance mechanisms**, including multisignature authorization controls and emergency response systems, would provide operational accountability. Finally, the infrastructure would need **cross-border interoperability and multi-chain deployment**, with integration into multiple blockchain networks and continuous monitoring to mitigate interconnected risks [Child 1].\n\n---\n\n### **2. Security and Scalability Needs**\n\nStablecoin deployment must balance high levels of security with system scalability. **Smart contract and integration security** forms a major pillar, requiring rigorously audited contracts that incorporate programmable compliance and enable seamless API-based enterprise integration [Child 1]. **KYC and privacy-preserving protocols** supported by cryptographic attestations ensure compliant identity management without compromising user data privacy [Child 1].  \n\nFrom a scalability standpoint, **compliance-aware interoperability layers** enable real-time, cross-border transactions that could operate at the scale of national and global payment systems. This combination of compliance automation, cryptographic security, and modular smart contract design sets a feasible\u2014though technologically demanding\u2014foundation for stablecoin adoption in regulated contexts [Child 1].\n\n---\n\n### **3. Integration with Existing Systems**\n\nIntegration of an official stablecoin into current financial systems would leverage a **layered architecture** connecting blockchain networks with regulated custody systems and traditional banking rails via APIs [Child 2]. Custody frameworks would include both custodial and self-custodial models, ensuring proper asset segregation, secure key management, and real-time reconciliation with existing internal ledgers [Child 2].  \n\n**APIs act as functional bridges** between blockchain and conventional systems by facilitating stablecoin payments, fiat conversions, and automated settlements while enabling inbuilt compliance checks such as AML and KYC [Child 2]. Blockchain transparency, coupled with enhanced monitoring, would allow financial institutions to integrate compliance protocols linking on-chain transactions to verified identities [Child 2]. Moreover, **banking on/off-ramps** supporting real-time liquidity transfer between fiat and digital forms would be essential for smooth operation. This infrastructure suggests partial feasibility\u2014key integration points exist today, but system-wide interoperability, especially between legacy banking software and blockchain-based settlement, would require phased upgrades [Child 2].\n\n---\n\n### **4. Overall Technological Feasibility**\n\nCombining both technical and infrastructural perspectives, stablecoin adoption is **feasible but contingent on further development**. The **core technologies**\u2014secure wallets, audited smart contracts, governance systems, compliance automation, and cross-chain interoperability\u2014are well understood and have functional predecessors in the private sector [Child 1]. Meanwhile, **banking integration infrastructure**, including APIs and reconciliation frameworks, already enables digital payment interoperability in limited contexts [Child 2].  \n\nHowever, broad-scale deployment would necessitate **modernization of banking infrastructure**, broader adoption of cryptographic identity standards, and **regulatory technology harmonization** to ensure seamless interoperation between digital and fiat systems. Therefore, while technically achievable in the near term, large-scale, society-wide stablecoin integration would depend on progressive infrastructure alignment and policy-backed technological evolution.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**  \nFrom a technological and infrastructural standpoint, stablecoin adoption is **technically feasible but infrastructure-dependent**. The necessary security, scalability, and compliance frameworks exist in concept and partial implementation. Yet full feasibility\u2014especially integration into the national payment ecosystem\u2014will rely on continued modernization of financial infrastructure, regulatory innovation, and cross-system interoperability enhancements [Child 1][Child 2]."

              "Stablecoins offer users several advantages. For starters, they are designed to maintain a stable value, making them less volatile than other cryptocurrencies. They are also programmable, which means they can be automatically managed and controlled. This makes them a relatively reliable medium of exchange within the blockchain universe.\n\u201cStablecoins are a digital, on-chain form of fiat money. They are easy to self-custody and transact, and they are also fast, particularly in the context of cross-border money movement. One could even consider them a better form than fiat, as they can move quicker and less expensively across existing financial infrastructure in certain circumstances,\u201d Worthington said. As such, they are well-suited for the traditional financial services system, where the movement of cash needs to keep pace with transactions that are increasingly executed outside of usual business hours.\nOn the flip side, stablecoins could pose a threat to financial stability. For instance, stablecoins could have significant run risks, in which a large group of investors redeem their holdings simultaneously. \u201cThe collapse of TerraUSD in May 2022 highlights just how quickly a run can occur, in an asset class that trades 24/7,\u201d Ho remarked. The effects of a massive liquidation could spill over to other markets, destabilizing the traditional banking system.\nIn addition, the [Bank for International Settlements (BIS)](https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2025e3.htm) posits that stablecoins fall short on three key tests for money:\n  * Stablecoins that are traded in secondary markets might be exchanged at a slight deviation from par with the fiat currency they are pegged to.\n  * The issuer\u2019s balance sheet cannot be expanded at will, and any additional supply of stablecoins would require full upfront payment by its holders.",
              "In addition, the bill establishes strict reserve requirements, mandating that each stablecoin be backed one-to-one with U.S. dollars, short-term Treasuries and other high-quality assets. However, it is unclear whether non-bank stablecoin issuers will have access to the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, which is critical when it comes to addressing run risks.\n\u201cClearly, these developments are still very much in their nascent phase. But one thing is for certain \u2014 there is more to come as the industry continues to explore product innovation to integrate stablecoins into the traditional financial system,\u201d Ho said. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early to know how this will play out, but it could potentially challenge how we think about liquidity in the money markets over the longer term.\u201d \nListen to our latest episode from Making Sense: How stablecoins are reshaping global finance\nIn this episode, Kenneth Worthington, a Brokers, Asset Managers and Exchanges equity analyst at J.P. Morgan, is joined by Teresa Ho, head of U.S. Short Duration Strategy, to explore the dynamic world of stablecoins. Together, they break down what stablecoins are, how they work and why they\u2019re gaining so much attention in today\u2019s financial landscape. The discussion covers how stablecoins differ from deposits and money market funds, the impact of recent legislation such as the GENIUS Act, as well as what all this could mean for the future of finance."

There\u2019s some disintermediation in the sense of the shift in the curve of total demand for Treasury assets.\nWhile short-term repos against long-term Treasuries likely don\u2019t transfer much of the duration risk of long-term Treasuries to the stablecoin, some of it could remain\u2014such as when 30-year bond prices fell by \u22488% in a week in March 2020 (particularly if stablecoin disclosure requirements are such that markets can see the collateral exposure).\nThe greater financial stability risk here is tying the supply of funding in money markets to crypto market cap. When cryptoasset market cap goes up, the supply of stablecoins needs to grow\u2014and vice versa.\nThat means that when crypto assets fall, money market funding is . This is likely manageable in \u201cnormal\u201d times for, though less so if the stablecoin market does indeed grow substantially. And certainly less so if it happens alongside a systemic event.\n\u201cDeposits in insured depository institutions\u201d is a common, unfortunate phrase, because it implies the institution is insured\u2014rather than deposits up to $250,000. (Yes, in a systemiccrisis, there are mechanisms by which larger amounts can be protected.)\nWe saw the risks to the stablecoin itself of holding reserves in banks when USDC was trading at less than 90 cents on the dollar while SVB\u2019s depositors\u2019 fate was uncertain; when they were rescued, redeeming USDC still faced  of USDC\u2019s bank deposit partners prior to March 2023 is surreal in hindsight\nHowever, this dynamic only turns stablecoins into a financial stability risk if they grow tremendously, such as along the lines of the Standard Chartered estimates.",
              "The greater financial stability risk here, even at current stablecoin market caps, is akin to that noted for Treasury-backed repos: the tying of senior financial system funding (deposits in this case) to crypto market cap. That it\u2019s typically been mid-sized banks servicing crypto means stablecoin (and other crypto) deposits can represent a material part of the funding profile (and the market\u2019s view of their )\u2014again, particularly if the stablecoin market grows.\nAnd, to the extent the stablecoin market grows by coming into its own as a retail payment product, stablecoins would be effectively gathering insured (stable) deposits and , uninsured deposits concentrated in the banks servicing these clients.\nBitcoin, commodities, foreign commercial paper, whatever. Ironically, this is the one with the least financial stability risk if the stablecoin market remains around its current size and with current transaction purposes, which are, so far,  beyond participating in the crypto ecosystem. Risky assets forming the backing reserve has the least financial stability risk because stablecoin market cap can ebb and flow dramatically in this world and only affect the markets for risk assets, rather than systemically important funding markets.\nIf, however, nonbank stablecoins become a $1T+ market used for mainly real-economy transactions, then there\u2019s financial stability risk in the  losing any money, and you don\u2019t want this risky stuff backing any par liabilities that aren\u2019t issued by a regulated bank. Avoiding the risks in holding these kinds of assets has seemed to be Congress\u2019s primary motivation since it began drafting stablecoin bills.

These include the following:\n  * Delays in settlement of one to three business days are common when using traditional payment rails, especially when sending payments cross-border.\n  * Traditional payment processing typically involves multiple intermediaries (for example, correspondent banks and clearing houses); as a result, this process can generate multiple fees.\n  * Complex legacy infrastructure can obscure the routing and status of payments, especially during international transfers.\n  * Payment systems reliant on the traditional banking system usually only operate during business hours, which do not include weekends and holidays.\n  * Since much of the traditional payments infrastructure relies on banks, many people are underserved or excluded by KYC regulations and face other access hurdles such as the need for a state-issued ID or multiple proofs of residence.",
              "In addition, the creation of domestic payment systems (often unique to continents and even to individual markets) has led to many siloed systems and proprietary networks, making true global integration of payments difficult to achieve (Exhibit 2).\nImage description: A table compares legacy payment rails and stablecoin across speed, cost, cross-border, automation and programmability, security, transparency, settlement risks, and availability. Overall, stablecoins offer transformative capabilities that address key limitations of legacy payment systems, such as increased speed; lower costs; borderless, minimal, or nonexistent foreign transaction fees; and 24/7 operations. End of image description.\nOn top of these perennial issues, there has been a proliferation of needs, including merchant settlements, business-to-business payments, cross-border payments, retail remittances, and automated payments (for example, from government). As a result, demand has grown in the past decade for more-responsive, real-time, low-cost, secure, and inclusive global payment solutions.\nSome incumbents historically may have hesitated to pursue innovative payment systems in part because they might disrupt existing revenue lines. Competition among financial institutions has stymied efforts to collaborate, while a lack of standardization and consistent international regulations has prevented the emergence of a modern, global system. However, we believe such incumbents should continue to innovate, even if this might compete with existing revenue streams. Value drivers of existing legacy payment systems, such as ubiquity of acceptance and consumer protections, suggest they are not about to disappear.",

              "## How do stablecoins impact cross-border business payments compared to traditional methods? \nStablecoins most clearly outperform traditional payments when it comes to cross-border transactions.\nInternational wire transfers move via the network. A payment might pass through five or more correspondent banks, each taking a cut and delaying settlement. Funds can spend up to a week in transit with little visibility into where they are at any given moment. Costs add up quickly through up-front charges, extra fees per intermediary, and a percentage in FX spread. To mitigate them, companies often prefund accounts abroad, which ties up working capital. In some markets, local cards or banks simply can\u2019t connect internationally, which excludes entire customer segments.\nA stablecoin transfer removes the intermediaries, goes directly from sender to recipient, and is visible in real time on a public ledger. Settlement takes minutes, and blockchain costs are low. Contractors or vendors in can receive digital dollars even without a US bank account. In countries with volatile currencies, stablecoins can hold the steady value that local systems can\u2019t provide.\nStablecoins can reduce costs, open up new customer bases, and remove the opacity that has long plagued international money movement.\n## What are the compliance and regulatory considerations for stablecoins compared to traditional payments? \nTraditional payment networks follow mature rulebooks. Banks enforce Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, card networks build in consumer protections, and regulators have had decades to refine oversight. Banks and processors typically handle compliance.",
              "Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to a real-world asset, often a fiat currency such as the US dollar (USD) or , and are designed to hold steady value. One , for example, is designed to always equal roughly one dollar because it\u2019s backed by USD reserves. Businesses use stablecoins because they combine crypto\u2019s speed and reach with fiat\u2019s predictability.\nA typical payment works like this: a customer sends stablecoins from their digital wallet to the business\u2019s wallet and settlement occurs within minutes. There are no bank cutoff times and no pending statuses. Companies can keep the tokens for future payments or instantly convert them into local currency through a provider like .\n## What are the traditional payment methods in business? \nBusinesses still regularly move money through familiar networks: cards, bank transfers, and\u2014to a lesser extent\u2014cash or checks. Traditional networks are well known and universal but are generally slower, subject to higher fees, and restricted by banking hours. Here\u2019s a closer look at each method:\n  * These transactions depend on like Visa and Mastercard, with issuing banks, acquiring banks, and processors in the mix. The purchase feels instant to the customer, but businesses usually wait 1\u20133 days for settlement and pay a percentage of the transaction amount plus a flat fee.\n  * Making transfers through your bank is inexpensive but can take days. Wire transfers are faster but involve higher fees and sometimes hidden foreign exchange markups. Payments that are routed through multiple correspondent banks can take up to a week.\n  * While cash and checks are still used in some markets, they\u2019re costly to handle and painfully slow to clear.",
              "## How do stablecoin payments work for businesses compared to traditional payments? \nFundamentally, both and traditional payments do the same thing: they move value from the customer to the business. But stablecoins are an internet-native payment method with instant finality, while traditional methods rely on legacy institutions, intermediaries, and multiday settlement. Here\u2019s how each payment type works.\nA business provides a digital wallet address. The customer sends the agreed amount. Within minutes, the tokens settle on a blockchain and land in the business\u2019s wallet. The transfer is visible on a public network and it can\u2019t be reversed once it\u2019s confirmed. There are no bank intermediaries or cutoff times for processing. The business can hold stablecoins to pay suppliers or hedge against local volatility, or it can instantly convert them to local currency through an exchange or processor.\nCard flows run through layers, from the payment processor to the to the card network to the issuing bank. The business receives authorization instantly, but funds settle in batches a few days later. Direct deposits are slower still: domestic wire transfers can be same-day, but international ones often take days and pass through multiple correspondent banks. Some of these systems allow reversals (e.g., chargebacks on cards).\n## How do stablecoins compare to traditional payments on speed and settlement? \nStablecoins settle at internet speed. A transfer usually clears within seconds or minutes at any time of day, any day of the year. There are no cutoff times and no bank holidays. The payment is final once it\u2019s confirmed on the chain and it\u2019s irreversible like cash payment.\nTraditional systems are comparatively sluggish. Cards and take 1\u20133 business days. International wire transfers can take five days or more, especially if they route through multiple correspondent banks. Even a same-day domestic wire transfer is subject to bank cutoff times."

Stablecoins, which are digital assets capable of being redeemed for a fixed amount of monetary value, stand out as one such innovative payment method that reduces friction by allowing lower costs and faster settlement for merchants, all without the need to rely on traditional payment card networks. There\u2019s a rumor that several large merchants are exploring issuing their own stablecoins as an alternative payment method to reduce acceptance costs. And the [recently passed Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/insights/newsletters/2025/07/newsletters-practices-dcb-digital-currency-blockchain-q2-2025) provides a regulatory regime that could expand the adoption of stablecoins as alternative pay.",
              "A key driver to the adoption of stablecoins as an alternative payment is the elimination of the costs inherent in accepting traditional payment cards. Most merchants pay transaction and interchange fees \u2014 which may vary depending on the type of merchant, the type of transaction (e.g., card present or not present), and the card type \u2014 as a condition to acceptance of traditional payment cards (e.g., Amex, Mastercard, and Visa). Merchants\u2019 obligation to honor all cards, coupled with surcharging restrictions, have left merchants with little flexibility when it comes to acceptance costs, unless the merchant has a separate incentive arrangement with a card payment network to reduce acceptance costs. Because stablecoins operate on blockchain networks, direct transactions between a merchant and a customer can occur with minimal or no involvement from traditional financial institutions, which will eliminate the need for many acceptance fees and potentially introduce other inherent cost savings for merchants (e.g., reserve requirements and chargeback risks). \nBecause of their use of blockchain technology, stablecoins also significantly reduce settlement times associated with traditional payment rails by \n  * bypassing intermediaries in the clearing process, including many of the players in the current payment infrastructure (e.g., networks, issuing banks, acquiring banks, processors); \n  * offering 24-7 availability, reducing delays based on time zones, weekends, and holidays; and\n  * reducing reconciliation time due to the use of a public ledger.",
              "Stablecoins, therefore, satisfy the increasing demand for instant settlement, particularly in an increasingly global marketplace. \nEven with these benefits, however, the lack of a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins may impede wider adoption by merchants and consumers alike.\n## The Promise of the GENIUS Act\nThe GENIUS Act, which establishes the first federal regulatory framework specifically for the issuance and use of payment stablecoins, passed in the Senate and the House with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Trump on July 18, 2025. Among other requirements, the GENIUS Act requires issuers to provide a full reserve for dollar-backed stablecoins and to provide monthly public disclosures and audited financial statements. Stablecoin issuers will also be subject to the Bank Secrecy Act for anti-money laundering and related purposes and would be subject to oversight by federal or state regulators. \nThe passage of the GENIUS Act represents a significant step forward with the broader adoption of stablecoins, and blockchain more generally, across the payments space. Payment providers like PayPal and Stripe already support stablecoin transactions, and other platforms are expected to soon follow. And while merchants may be initially hesitant to embrace this alternative payment method, any up-front investment required to integrate this technology will be substantially outweighed by the benefits of stablecoins, which present the opportunity to improve both the customer experience and the merchant\u2019s bottom line.\nWe practice in every fintech vertical, including payments, deposits, lending, digital assets, and alternative finance. \n_This informational piece, which may be considered advertising under the ethical rules of certain jurisdictions, is provided on the understanding that it does not constitute the rendering of legal advice or other professional advice by Goodwin or its lawyers.

              "Stablecoins offer users several advantages. For starters, they are designed to maintain a stable value, making them less volatile than other cryptocurrencies. They are also programmable, which means they can be automatically managed and controlled. This makes them a relatively reliable medium of exchange within the blockchain universe.\n\u201cStablecoins are a digital, on-chain form of fiat money. They are easy to self-custody and transact, and they are also fast, particularly in the context of cross-border money movement. One could even consider them a better form than fiat, as they can move quicker and less expensively across existing financial infrastructure in certain circumstances,\u201d Worthington said. As such, they are well-suited for the traditional financial services system, where the movement of cash needs to keep pace with transactions that are increasingly executed outside of usual business hours.\nOn the flip side, stablecoins could pose a threat to financial stability. For instance, stablecoins could have significant run risks, in which a large group of investors redeem their holdings simultaneously. \u201cThe collapse of TerraUSD in May 2022 highlights just how quickly a run can occur, in an asset class that trades 24/7,\u201d Ho remarked. The effects of a massive liquidation could spill over to other markets, destabilizing the traditional banking system.\nIn addition, the [Bank for International Settlements (BIS)](https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2025e3.htm) posits that stablecoins fall short on three key tests for money:\n  * Stablecoins that are traded in secondary markets might be exchanged at a slight deviation from par with the fiat currency they are pegged to.\n  * The issuer\u2019s balance sheet cannot be expanded at will, and any additional supply of stablecoins would require full upfront payment by its holders."

              ". In all of these arenas, banks and nonbanks will compete, and the question of whether federal and state standards are actually equivalent figures to be a live question for years to come. Even where banks, nonbanks, and state charters will be subject to equivalent stablecoin issuance regulatory regimes, banks and bank holding companies will be starting from a place of heightened regulatory restrictions \u2014 with supervision, capital, liquidity, management, activity, and affiliate transaction requirements that nonbanks do not have. Moreover, nonbank digital assets companies may have more experience and technical know-how in blockchain markets and applications that make them better suited to many roles within the payment stablecoin ecosystem. And, of course, banks, as depository institutions, may operate as service providers to payment stablecoin issuers, for example, as providers of deposit reserves and custody services, while developing other new services to, and partnerships with, digital asset companies and other nonbanks. Finally, it appears that agency rulemaking will play a significant role in the stablecoin regulatory landscape in the coming months and years, and we expect affected parties will seek to make their voices heard through rulemaking and congressional oversight.",
              "3.

              "Payment stablecoin issuers that are subsidiaries of insured depository institutions generally will be regulated by the federal banking agency that supervises the parent depository institution. Other permitted issuers, including federal branches of foreign banking organizations and uninsured national banks, will be regulated by the OCC.

Nonbank entities could apply to the OCC for permission to issue payment stablecoins as a \u201cfederal qualified payment stablecoin issuer\u201d and, if successful, would be supervised by the OCC.

              "Stablecoins present macro considerations as well. For one, their increased use in money laundering and terrorist financing poses risks to national security. In addition, increased holdings of stablecoins by the public could potentially draw down bank deposits and thereby limit the efficacy of monetary policy. On the other hand, if issuers hold cash reserves as deposits and steer new cash into banks, such as from unbanked or foreign populations, stablecoin uptake may increase deposits and enhance the transmission of monetary policy. The composition of reserves also has implications for public finance\u2014U.S. Treasury securities, not cash, [are currently the favored reserve asset](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2025/04/stablecoins-and-crypto-shocks-an-update/) of the largest stablecoin issuers, who are already as significant holders of Treasury bills as the largest U.S. money market funds. Continued stablecoin growth could therefore bolster demand for government debt, not to mention the global dominance of the dollar, which is overwhelmingly the peg of choice among tokens currently in circulation.\n## How are stablecoins regulated in the US?",
              "In July 2025, Congress passed the , which [establishes a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/stablecoins-issues-for-regulators-as-they-implement-genius-act/). Similar to the U.S.\u2019s dual banking system, stablecoin issuers may apply for approval from either federal or (if total issuance is below $10 billion) state regulators in states where such regulation exists. Issuers must back their stablecoins one-to-one with reserves of cash or other permitted assets\u2014such as Treasury securities, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, government money market funds, bank deposits, or tokenized versions of the same\u2014and must report monthly on the composition of their reserves. Issuers will also be subject to federal anti-money laundering regulations. Their stablecoins, which cannot pay interest, must be redeemable for a fixed monetary value. The law designates the Treasury\u2019s Comptroller of the Currency as the federal regulator for nonbank issuers, whereas bank subsidiaries that wish to issue stablecoins will be regulated by the applicable state or federal bank regulators. State and federal regulators have until July 2026 to finalize implementation rules, including stablecoins\u2019 tax characterization, standards for foreign stablecoins sold in the U.S., and policies regarding conflicts of interest for stablecoin issuers, an issue of public debate [given the Trump family\u2019s growing business in crypto assets](https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/09/02/trump-world-liberty-financial-crypto-blockchain-token-wealth-bitcoin/). The law does not cover what it terms \u201cnon-payment stablecoins,\u201d which include algorithmic stablecoins, and remain in the purview of state regulators.",
              "Previously, all stablecoins were regulated and supervised as money transmitters, primarily at the state level. Many state governments [have applied existing rules, and some have passed new laws](https://stevenscenter.wharton.upenn.edu/publications-50-state-review/), to subject issuers and exchangers of crypto assets to regulations for consumer protection and financial soundness. Money transmitters are required to register with the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which in 2013 clarified that reporting requirements for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) [apply equally to the transmission of crypto assets](https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/guidance/application-fincens-regulations-persons-administering). Banks, for their part, needed special permission under Biden administration policies to custody crypto assets, hold reserves for stablecoin issuers as deposits, and participate in blockchains, but the Comptroller of the Currency [reversed this policy in March 2025](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-16.html).\nIn 2015, the New York Division of Financial Services\u2014an early mover on crypto regulation\u2014began requiring businesses engaged in any of several activities involving crypto assets to and comply with standards including capital requirements, AML programs, and consumer protection. New York first approved the issuance of stablecoins by licensees in 2018, and in 2022 [clarified that licensees issuing U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins must hold full reserves](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20220608_issuance_stablecoins) of highly safe and liquid assets, publish monthly attestations of reserve adequacy by independent accountants, and redeem stablecoins for reserves in a timely fashion under clearly disclosed policies."

All issuers fall under the Bank Secrecy Act, making AML/CFT and sanctions compliance non-negotiable.\n  * Payment stablecoins are carved out from securities and commodities law, removing them from SEC and CFTC jurisdiction and squarely placing oversight with banking regulators.",
              "The impact on the market has been immediate Coinbase, Circle, and other US-linked issuers are seen as compliance winners, while offshore or under-collateralised tokens face significant pressure. There is reason to think the Treasury could benefit too: mandatory T-bill reserves mean stablecoin issuers may become major buyers of government debt, reinforcing dollar demand globally. Critics, however, warn of financial-stability spillovers \u2014 if redemptions force mass Treasury sales, yields could spike.\nThe EU introduced its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) in 2024. It sets out a licensing regime for issuers of \u201casset-referenced tokens\u201d and \u201ce-money tokens\u201d, with strict requirements on capital, governance, and reserve management. MiCA also allows regulators to restrict non-euro stablecoins if their use exceeds 1 million transactions and EUR 200 million per day, a safeguard aimed at protecting monetary sovereignty. While the regime creates compliance costs, it also offers legal certainty, potentially boosting adoption among institutional users. For global issuers, however, the euro-centric design presents strategic challenges.\n## United Kingdom: Integrating into FSMA\nThe UK is in the process of bringing stablecoins under existing payments and e-money legislation via amendments to the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA), with draft rules under consultation. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will oversee compliance, while the Bank of England will supervise systemic stablecoins. The Treasury has made clear that privately issued stablecoins can play a role in payments, provided they meet operational resilience and redemption standards. This pragmatic approach aligns with the UK\u2019s ambition to be a digital finance hub, but details of secondary legislation and supervisory intensity remain to be tested.",
              "These themes reflect regulators\u2019 balancing act: encouraging innovation while safeguarding monetary stability.\nStablecoins remain a small section of the wider cryptocurrency market, but recent regulatory developments give reason to think their share may grow. Whilst cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are speculative assets, stablecoins\u2019 reduced volatility makes them more viable as a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account.\nNew rules generally raise barriers to entry. Smaller issuers may exit or partner with regulated institutions, while larger players with balance-sheet capacity consolidate market share. This mirrors patterns seen in e-money and payments regulation over the past decade.\nBanks and established PSPs are entering the stablecoin arena, either by issuing tokens directly or by providing custody and reserve services. This could erode the first-mover advantage of crypto-native firms and tilt the market towards regulated incumbents.\nMiCA\u2019s daily transaction cap on non-euro stablecoins could limit the use of USD-backed coins in Europe, potentially fragmenting money flow. Conversely, the clarity provided by the framework may encourage the development of euro-denominated alternatives. With the GENIUS Act, the US has removed much of the regulatory uncertainty that previously pushed innovation abroad. While smaller issuers may still find compliance burdens heavy, larger players now have a clearer pathway to operate domestically.\nThe lack of harmonisation complicates cross-border payments. A stablecoin fully compliant in Singapore may fall foul of MiCA caps or US banking rules. For multinational PSPs, this means higher legal complexity, compliance costs, and operational risk."

Stablecoins have also long been a lynchpin of cryptocurrency transactions, allowing users to move relatively easily from cryptocurrency to \u201cfiat\u201d through a stablecoin and then back into a different cryptocurrency.\nUse of stablecoins in connection with cryptocurrency transactions has been highly successful. In 2024, total stablecoin transfer volume was US$27.6 trillion, almost all of it used for digital asset transactions, and its market capitalization grew to US$150 billion. However, adoption of these digital assets for cross-border transactions or for retail payments has been slow, due in large part to uncertainty as to how stablecoins would be regulated. Recently, however, the regulatory landscape has become much clearer, particularly in the United States, paving the way for widespread adoption of stablecoins. In this chapter, we provide some background on stablecoins, and then an analysis of the current state of stablecoin regulation in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and Hong Kong.",

The law also provides for recognition of foreign-issued stablecoins if they are subject to regulatory and supervisory requirements that are \u201ccomparable\u201d to those applicable to PPSIs, as determined by the Treasury Secretary upon a recommendation from each other member of the SCRC.\nSignificantly, if a payment stablecoin is not issued by a PPSI, then it cannot be: (i) treated as cash or cash equivalent for accounting purposes; (ii) eligible as cash or cash equivalent margin or collateral for broker-dealers, swap dealers, and certain other intermediaries; or (iii) accepted as a settlement asset to facilitate wholesale payments between banking organizations.\nUnder the GENIUS Act, so-called \u201cdigital asset service providers\u201d (, digital asset intermediaries, exchanges and custodians) will be generally prohibited from offering or selling payment stablecoins that are not issued by a PPSI beginning on July 18, 2028. In addition, they are prohibited from offering, selling or otherwise making available a payment stablecoin issued by a foreign stablecoin issuer unless such issuer has the technological capability to comply, and will comply, with the terms of any lawful order to seize, freeze, burn, or prevent the transfer of outstanding stablecoins, among other requirements.\n### Principal requirements for licensed stablecoin issuers\nThe GENIUS Act sets forth a number compliance and other requirements for stablecoin issuers. These requirements will be central to the evaluation of license applications.\n#### _Reserve, redemption, and disclosure requirements_"

Binance Holdings Ltd., No. 1:23-cv-01599 (D.D.C. June 28, 2024), ECF No. 248.\nSignificant variation exists in state-level regulation of stablecoins. Across the country, money transmission laws apply to stablecoin-related activities. However, some states, such as New York, offer specific guidance or entire regulatory regimes tailored for stablecoins. New York pioneered the BitLicense in 2015, which operates as a license and charter-based system for digital assets. \nSuch a license is required to conduct a digital asset business in New York. In June 2022, New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) released guidance on issuing U.S. dollar\u2013backed stablecoins. \nIndustry Guidance, Adrienne A. Harris, Superintendent of Fin. Servs., N.Y. Dep\u2019t of Fin. Servs., [Guidance on the Issuance of U.S. Dollar\u2013Backed Stablecoins](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20220608_issuance_stablecoins) (June 8, 2022).\nThe guidance applies to U.S. dollar\u2013backed stablecoin issuers licensed under a BitLicense or chartered as limited-purpose trust companies under New York banking law. The guidance creates \u201crecommendations or principles\u201d related to redeemability, reserves, and attestation (confirmation of accounting statements). Stablecoin issuers must hold at least a 1:1 ratio of reserves segregated from other assets, and the reserves must be highly liquid.",
              "The reserves are subject to NYDFS approval and may only be comprised of \u201cU.S. Treasury bills acquired by the Issuer three months or less from their respective maturities\u201d; \u201cReverse repurchase agreements fully collateralized by U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes, and/or U.S. Treasury bonds on an overnight basis\u201d; \u201cGovernment money-market funds\u201d; or \u201cDeposit accounts at U.S. state or federally chartered depository institutions.\u201d Issuers must adopt clear redemption policies that allow for timely redemption (not more than two full business days) at par value. Moreover, stablecoin issuers must release public attestations monthly that a third-party accountant verifies. NYDFS issued these requirements as guidance, not rules. However, the guidance states that \u201c[i]ssuers that currently issue U.S. dollar\u2013backed stablecoins under DFS supervision are expected to come into compliance with this Guidance within three months of the date hereof.\u201d \nAlthough there are many differences in jurisdictional approaches to stablecoin regulation, some common regulatory principles emerge:\n  1. Stablecoin issuances require explicit regulatory approval by the appropriate regulator.\n  2. Reserves must be liquid and stable, ensuring that they can cover all issued stablecoins on a 1:1 basis.\n  3. Stablecoin payment services must align with existing financial regulations, offering protections akin to traditional currency-based payment systems. \nCryptocurrency companies in the U.S. are already subject to all state-based money-service business laws and must register as a money services business (MSB) in any state in which they operate.",

Many stablecoins have experienced market price fluctuation.\n  * Some foreign jurisdictions have passed laws regulating stablecoins. The EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) categorizes stablecoins into electronic money tokens (EMTs) and asset-referenced tokens (ARTs). The UK framework categorizes stablecoin payments as hybrid or pure.\n  * The U.S. lacks comprehensive federal legislation, but certain existing regulations apply. Significant variation exists in state-level regulation of stablecoins. New York pioneered the BitLicense in 2015, which operates as a license and charter-based system for digital assets.\n  * Common principles include the following: stablecoin issuances require explicit regulatory approval; reserves must be liquid and stable, ensuring that they can cover all issued stablecoins on a 1:1 basis; and stablecoin payment services must align with existing financial regulations."

Singapore\u2019s framework requires exclusive local issuance for regulated status, while Hong Kong\u2019s regime asserts extraterritorial jurisdiction over HKD-pegged stablecoins globally.\nThe UK\u2019s developing framework appears most aligned with U.S. principles, though final rules remain pending.\nJapan requires institutional partnerships between issuers and banks or trust companies, representing a more restrictive model. Switzerland maintains a guidance-based approach offering flexibility but less legal certainty.\nThe GENIUS Act\u2019s comparable regime provisions may open opportunities for regulatory reciprocity, particularly with jurisdictions adopting similar prudential standards. However, initial determinations will likely prove restrictive given the unanimous approval requirement and high U.S. standards.\nSection 15 of the GENIUS Act further directs the Federal Reserve and Treasury to pursue reciprocal agreements with foreign jurisdictions, indicating congressional intent to eventually harmonize global stablecoin standards beyond the narrow comparable regime framework.\n## Other Key Takeaways for Market Participants\nExisting Stablecoin Issuers should immediately assess their path to compliance, determining whether federal or state licensing best suits their business model. Reserve portfolios require realignment to permitted assets, and operational infrastructure needs significant enhancement to meet disclosure and technical requirements.\nFinancial Institutions should evaluate opportunities in stablecoin issuance, leveraging existing regulatory relationships and infrastructure advantages. Banks may also benefit from providing custody services for reserves and stablecoins, subject to appropriate risk management."

              "# How to Build a Compliant Stablecoin Infrastructure for Enterprise Use\nBuilding a compliant stablecoin infrastructure is essential for enterprises exploring blockchain payments. Stablecoins offer speed, transparency and 24/7 settlement, but they also come with regulatory requirements and operational risks. Industry leaders embed compliance from day one integrating KYC/AML checks, travel-rule data sharing, and transaction monitoring directly into their payment stacks.\nIn practice, \u201cstablecoin compliance\u201d means meeting the same regulatory standards as traditional finance: rigorous identity verification, on-chain transaction scrutiny, and adherence to global laws. By prioritizing compliance early, businesses earn the trust of banks and regulators and unlock the full potential of blockchain-based enterprise payments.\nBuilding trust with stablecoins requires addressing several core requirements:\n  * \u2014 Verified onboarding of wallet users. Enterprises must use robust identity checks (government IDs, biometrics, proof-of-address) and link those credentials to blockchain addresses. Some solutions now offer \u201con-chain KYC,\u201d where cryptographic attestations of a user\u2019s verified identity are anchored on-chain without exposing personal data. This lets compliant users transact permissionlessly while signaling their KYC status to smart contracts. As Fireblocks notes, firms should implement workflows that \u201cverify identities through documentation and biometrics\u201d and perform dynamic risk assessments (behavioral analysis, device fingerprinting, geolocation checks) during onboarding.",
              "Secure custody builds confidence with regulators and partners. It also safeguards the business itself: as McKinsey notes, losing keys or reserve control can undermine the entire stablecoin project, even if the blockchain protocol is sound.\n## Smart Contracts, APIs and Integration\nA compliant stablecoin infrastructure also relies on . Smart contracts must be securely written and audited, and enterprise systems (bank ledgers, ERP, CRM) need API connectivity to the crypto rails.\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n_Diagram of enterprise smart contract architecture showing modular compliance hooks and API integration with payment systems (Source: Kaleido)_\n  * Every token contract or payment contract should undergo a rigorous security review before deployment. Auditors can verify that the contract has no logic errors and properly incorporates compliance checks. For example, a contract might include functions or modifiers that automatically block transfers involving non-verified addresses or blacklisted wallets. Embedding such checks at the code level can a transaction at the moment it violates policy.\n  * Architect the system so that KYC/AML components are modular and pluggable. For instance, a payment API might call out to an external compliance engine before executing any transaction. This way, updates to global sanctions lists or local regulations can be integrated without redesigning the whole system.\n  * Use APIs and middleware to connect stablecoins with existing corporate treasury and payment systems. An enterprise-ready ledger should translate stablecoin transactions into the company\u2019s accounting system, update accounts payable/receivable, and trigger corporate controls (just like a SWIFT message would). This ensures stablecoins become a first-class asset in the enterprise finance stack."

Advanced stablecoin implementations incorporate features such as pause functionality for emergency situations, blacklist capabilities for regulatory compliance and upgrade \nmechanisms that allow issuers to modify contract behavior while maintaining token continuity. \nMulti-signature controls represent critical security features in stablecoin smart contracts, requiring multiple authorized parties to approve significant actions such as token minting, contract upgrades or emergency pauses. These controls help prevent single points of failure and provide additional security layers that are particularly important for institutional adoption and regulatory compliance. \nThe transparency characteristics of blockchain technology create both opportunities and challenges for stablecoin operations. While all transactions are publicly visible and verifiable, providing unprecedented transparency into stablecoin flows and usage patterns, this visibility also creates privacy considerations for institutional users if the transactions are on public blockchains, as opposed to private blockchains, and potential compliance challenges in jurisdictions with strict financial privacy requirements. \nThe multi-chain nature of modern blockchain infrastructure has led to the deployment of major stablecoins across multiple networks, each with distinct technical characteristics and trade-offs. for example, operates on over ten different blockchain networks including Ethereum, Tron, Polygon and Avalanche, with each deployment requiring separate technical integration and risk assessment [12].",
              "Cross-chain bridge technology enables the transfer of stablecoins between different blockchain networks, but these bridges represent additional technical and security risks that must be evaluated in institutional risk management frameworks. Bridge exploits have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, highlighting the importance of understanding cross-chain risks when evaluating multi-chain stablecoin strategies. In addition, the interoperability of the cryptoasset ecosystem means that bridge functionality allows bad actors to use this feature to obfuscate stablecoin transactions before it is off-ramped to fiat.\nThe governance structures of stablecoin protocols determine how technical parameters are adjusted, upgrades are implemented and emergency responses are coordinated. These governance mechanisms represent critical components of stablecoin systems that directly impact their long-term stability and adaptability to changing market conditions. \nDecentralized governance through token voting enables community control over protocol parameters but may also introduce decision-making delays and coordination challenges during crisis situations. The balance between decentralization and operational efficiency represents an ongoing challenge for stablecoin protocol design and a key consideration for institutional evaluation. \nEmergency response mechanisms, including pause functionality and emergency governance procedures, provide critical safeguards for stablecoin systems during extreme market conditions or security incidents. Understanding these mechanisms and their activation procedures is essential for institutional risk management and contingency planning."

The vast majority are tied to the U.S. dollar, but the U.S. lacks a strong, consistent, and coherent regulatory framework. I describe below some essential features of a regulatory framework for the U.S. that would both support financial innovation and reduce serious risks, many of which were highlighted in in 2021 by the President\u2019s Working Group. Current financial regulations, mainly a diverse set of state money transmitter licensing requirements, are inadequate for significant stablecoins that operate across state and national borders, raise new and unique illicit finance risks, and threaten monetary and financial stability.\nStablecoins function as \u201cdigital cash\u201d issued by a private firm that is recorded and transferred on a blockchain rather than on the books and records of a commercial bank or central bank. The market value of stablecoins has grown from less than $20 billion in 2019 to more than $230 billion on a global basis in early 2025. Stablecoins currently are used mainly for trading crypto assets, although there is growing use of USD-based stablecoins in countries with less stable domestic currencies. Evidence points to increased use for terrorist financing and money laundering.",
              "to increase competition and efficiency of payments and capital markets activities as well as to support the global role of the dollar and U.S. national security. Stablecoins could make payments more efficient and available in real time as consumers increasingly demand faster, cheaper payments and businesses aim for efficiencies. For instance, blockchain rails could increase efficiency and innovation in cross-border payments and corporate treasury management as well as in merchant payments. The upside is greater if tokenization of securities becomes more widespread, since stablecoins would be a natural means of payment for securities transactions that are executed on-chain.\nBut stablecoins come with risks. From a financial stability perspective, they could be subject to runs if their value is not truly stable, and they could undermine the safety of payments if their operations are not robust to a range of operational and cyber threats. And their potential to scale rapidly because of network effects could increase risks to credit intermediation and monetary policy transmission if insured depository institutions lose significant deposits to stablecoins, or could lead to excessive concentration of power if stablecoins are issued by commercial firms. In addition, stablecoins present new and significant illicit financing risks since values can be transferred quickly across borders if actors are able to exploit weaknesses in international anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards. \nTo address the risks that stablecoins pose, a regulatory framework should include seven essential features:",
              "1. Reserve assets of a stablecoin issuer need to be ultra-safe and liquid if stablecoins are to function as money issued by a private firm. Because stablecoins do not have deposit insurance or access to a lender of last resort, they need to be backed by safe and liquid assets, like cash, Treasury bills, and central bank reserves, so they can offer convertibility at par. If assets with either credit or counterparty risk were to be permitted, the stablecoin issuer should be required to hold more capital and liquidity for those risks. Private money backed by risky assets with inadequate capital would be vulnerable to destabilizing runs and lose its ability to function as a medium of exchange.\n  2. Stablecoin issuers\u2019 activities should be limited to issuance and redemption (and ancillary activities), and issuers that achieve significant size should be subject to prudential federal regulations for capital, liquidity, and risk management calibrated to its limited activities. An issuer also should be subject to strong operational standards to ensure payment finality and reliability and its resilience to crypto, cyber, and other threats. In addition, stablecoin issuers should be subject to consumer protection rules that apply to similar payment products and services. At a minimum, the qualifications and integrity of an applicant should be considered when financial regulators consider granting a charter, either for a nonbank or a subsidiary of a depository institution.\n  3. Reserve assets of a stablecoin should be segregated and prioritized in bankruptcy, so that holders can still access their payment stablecoins if a stablecoin issuer were to fail. Clear rights to immediate redemption are needed for stablecoins of a failing issuer to prevent payment disruptions even as the issuer\u2019s liabilities are settled in bankruptcy over a longer period."

They could reshape how the government pays contractors. If adopted, these tools could be used to:\n  * Deliver real-time payments to vendors and subrecipients\n  * Cut foreign exchange costs for international projects\n  * Speed up disbursements for grants or disaster relief\n  * Maintain transparent, traceable records that meet audit requirements\n\nThis shift also helps preserve the dollar\u2019s global standing. By backing stablecoins with U.S. assets, the government increases global demand for Treasuries and reinforces dollar dominance."

              "## How Payment Firms and Institutions Embed Stablecoins\nIntegrating stablecoins into a payments stack requires more than just adding a token, it means engaging with the underlying systems that make secure, compliant, and scalable digital asset operations possible. For firms building stablecoin-powered flows, success depends on a coordinated of custody, network access, APIs, and reconciliation systems.\nNot every institution begins with full-stack . Many start by partnering with third parties to access the rails. But over time, as internal expertise and regulatory clarity grow, firms move toward more direct control of custody, execution, and treasury. This transition, from C, is increasingly measured in months, not years.\nPlatforms that anticipate this journey, and architect for it early, gain the speed, margin, and resilience advantages that come from owning the payment flow.Here are four foundational components:\n### 1. Custody and Wallet Infrastructure\nStablecoins need to be securely held before they can move. Most payment firms implement either custodial or self-custodial wallet models, depending on their regulatory posture, internal expertise, and desired control.\n  * rely on regulated third parties to store assets and manage private keys.\n  * offers greater control but also requires robust key management, policy enforcement, and operational safeguards.\n\n  * Segregated wallets for clients or use cases\n  * Granular access control to mitigate operational risk\n  * Pre-transaction simulation and approval workflows\n  * Compatibility with internal ledgering and treasury systems",
              "Wallet orchestration is also essential, especially for platforms managing both corporate treasury and end-user balances within the same environment.\nStablecoin transactions settle on blockchain networks, each with distinct trade-offs in speed, cost, and ecosystem compatibility.\n  * \u2013 well-supported, highly secure, but relatively expensive\n  * , , \u2013 cost-effective and fast, often favored in emerging markets\n  * , , \u2013 optimized for specific geographies or use cases\n\n  * (signing, gas fees, execution)\n  * , as stablecoins often exist across multiple networks\n  * Interoperability tools to reduce fragmentation and support \n\nFirms often select multiple blockchains to balance reliability with regional cost-efficiency and latency needs.\n### 3. APIs for Checkout and Settlement\nTo make stablecoins usable at scale, they must plug directly into familiar payment and treasury workflows. This is typically done through APIs that abstract blockchain complexity and connect on-chain assets with front-end interfaces or back-office systems.\n  * Real-time merchant settlement or mass payouts\n  * Internal disbursements (e.g., payroll, affiliate commissions)\n\n  * Integrated conversion (e.g., auto-swap to fiat)\n  * Regulatory and KYC/KYB workflows behind the scenes\n\nSome firms embed these APIs into proprietary platforms; others rely on third-party orchestration to simplify implementation and compliance.\n### 4. Multi-Stablecoin Support, FX Management, and Reconciliation\nThe proliferation of fiat-backed stablecoins, USDC, PYUSD, EURC, FDUSD, and others, means payment platforms must manage multiple currencies and conversion pathways.\n  * Support for stablecoin-to-stablecoin and fiat-to-stablecoin FX\n  * Dynamic pricing and routing tools to optimize costs across venues and partners\n  * Automated reconciliation tools that map on-chain flows to internal ledgers or ERP systems",
              "Leading platforms integrate these capabilities with:\n  * Policy controls for approved currencies and corridors\n  * Reporting systems for audit and compliance needs\n  * Real-time visibility into wallet-level balances and flows\n\n## Risks and Challenges of Integrating Stablecoins into Payment Infrastructure\nWhile stablecoins offer speed, transparency, and programmable features that make them an attractive addition to modern payment systems, their integration introduces several structural and operational challenges. For payment firms and institutions, understanding and addressing these risks is essential to unlocking the full benefits of stablecoin-based payments.\n### 1. Regulatory Compliance and AML Requirements\nStablecoins exist at the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology, creating complexities for teams. Anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CTF), Know Your Customer (KYC), and Travel Rule requirements apply, but their enforcement varies widely across jurisdictions.\n  * Unlike centralized financial rails, blockchain-based stablecoin transactions are typically pseudonymous and irreversible, complicating regulatory enforcement.\n  * Firms must implement robust KYC/KYB procedures, monitor wallet activity in real time, and ensure compliance with global sanctions frameworks such as OFAC.\n  * Key vulnerabilities include on/off-ramps, unhosted wallets, and jurisdictional mismatches, which often fall into regulatory gray areas.\n  * Many regulators have responded with frameworks requiring enhanced due diligence, user verification, and pre-transaction compliance checks.\n  * The new FATF Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to collect and disclose specific customer data when transacting digital assets over a particular value threshold. Global jurisdictions currently have different disclosure and threshold requirements with varied enforcement."

              "This growing appeal is why major players are taking notice. For example, the Worldpay stablecoin pilot signaled a major step toward mainstream adoption, demonstrating how established payment giants are exploring digital assets. \nIn 2025, several notable stablecoin launches further underscored this trend. Visa announced a stablecoin prefunding pilot through Visa Direct at SIBOS 2025, aimed at enabling faster business transactions. Tether unveiled USAT, a U.S.-based stablecoin designed to strengthen its presence in the U.S. market. Additionally, nine major European banks, including ING and UniCredit, have collaborated to explore or issue a new stablecoin, showcasing the growing interest from traditional financial institutions..\n## The Infrastructure Layer: What It Takes to Support Stablecoin Payments\nMaking stablecoin payments work for e-commerce requires more than just a blockchain. It needs a sophisticated technology stack that connects digital assets to the traditional financial world in a secure and compliant way.\nSeveral components are essential for building a robust system for stablecoin payments:\n  * Businesses need a safe place to hold their digital assets. must include enterprise-grade custody solutions, like multi-party computation (MPC) wallets, which protect funds from theft and unauthorized access. The settlement layer ensures that transactions are cleared and finalized reliably.\n  * For merchants to accept stablecoins, they need easy-to-integrate tools. Payment gateways and APIs act as the bridge, allowing e-commerce platforms to connect to blockchain networks without needing to build complex systems from scratch.\n  * To operate legally, payment providers must adhere to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. The best infrastructure for stablecoin payments integrates these compliance checks directly into the transaction flow, ensuring every payment is screened."

              "At the far end of the spectrum lies direct on-chain integration. In this case, you connect straight to blockchain network(s) in bypass of intermediaries.\nEffectively, you build your own wallet infrastructure and plug into the network. From the user\u2019s perspective, it looks just like depositing or withdrawing fiat. But behind the scenes, the platform is orchestrating on-chain transfers in real time.\nBecause this is a direct connection, you\u2019ll have to handle custody\u2014hot wallets for day-to-day flows and cold storage for reserves. Our team has recently helped a implement an effective treasury management mechanism for maintaining appropriate liquidity levels of stablecoin and cryptocurrencies traded on the platform. It allows them to on/off-ramp crypto, enforce security, and automate transfer policies between different wallets.\nCompliance also sits squarely on your side. Every inbound and outbound transfer should be screened against sanctions lists and blockchain analytics tools to prevent illicit flows. One way to do this is via smart contracts.Most centralized stablecoins have embedded logic for on-chain checks. You can program automatic sender/receiver blacklist checks or a command to add or remove addresses from the blacklist based on the off-chain screening you do (e.g., as part of your general KYC/KYB process). Some stablecoins\u2014USDT, USDC, and BUSD\u2014also give functionality to destroy or seize tokens from blacklisted addresses.",
              "Technically, this model requires operating blockchain nodes (or using API providers like or ) to detect deposits, assemble ERC-20 transfers, sign them securely, and reconcile on-chain balances with the platform\u2019s internal ledger. Every movement on-chain must have a matching record in the system\u2019s database\u2014similar to how banks reconcile accounts\u2014to maintain trust and accuracy.

The process is often intricate, but it\u2019s critical for compliance and future market scalability.\nIf fiat conversion is also part of the flow, you\u2019ll also need to find a partner to mint or redeem stablecoins. Likewise, you\u2019ll need to integrate with the banking rails in the target markets for fiat currency ramp-on (user top-ups) and ramp-off (user payouts).\nThe upside of running your own on-chain processing is obvious: minimal vendor fees, complete control over settlement logic, and the ability to design stablecoin flows exactly as your product demands.\nThe trade-off? High engineering complexity, regulatory exposure, and operational risk. You\u2019ll have to:",
              "This wave of favorable stablecoin regulations gives institutions the clarity they need to move from pilots to full-scale stablecoin adoption.\n## Stablecoins step in where banks fall short\nStablecoins fill in the gaps long overlooked by global banking systems: middlemen who used to manage local partnerships, fraud, and operations. They were necessary in the early days, but have become increasingly cumbersome (and to an extent unnecessary) in the digital finance age.\nStablecoin payments flow over blockchains, which are credibly neutral, auditable, composable, and designed to scale globally. Meaning you can keep full audit trails and add custom controls to prevent fraud or KYC\u2014all while benefiting from an already existing and widely adopted technology, linking people everywhere, just like an email.\nFor individuals, it means accessible, instant, and transparent money movement. For businesses, that translates into better cash flow predictability, smoother working capital management, and far fewer reconciliation headaches.\nAnd this opens up a new pane of use cases.\nThe global remittances stood at last year, with one billion people using some money transfer service. But the experience is far from great. Fees are high, and transfers take a long time to get routed.\nStablecoins eliminate the chain of correspondent banks by moving value directly on-chain, enabling transfers in seconds at a fraction of the cost of traditional remittance services."
