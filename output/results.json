  "writeup": "Recommendation: Conditional yes \u2014 support a substantial increase in federal social services for persons living in poverty, provided package\u2011level net federal cost estimates and feasible implementation/financing plans are produced and vetted.\n\n- One\u2011line rationale: Large unmet needs and consistent evidence that cash, nutrition, health\u2011coverage, and early\u2011childhood investments produce measurable poverty\u2011reduction and wellbeing gains, but credible fiscal sizing and implementation safeguards are missing and must be resolved before permanent national scale\u2011up (synthesis draws on node_2; fiscal/implementation caveats from node_3 and node_6) [1][2][3].\n\n- Top three conditions for support\n  1. Robust package\u2011level fiscal vetting: require gross and net federal cost estimates with sensitivity ranges and explicit modeled offsets (health savings, lifetime\u2011earnings effects) before permanent commitments (gap repeatedly identified; no package net estimates available in supplied material) (nodes: node_2; node_6; node_1_gap0...) [1][2][3].  \n  2. Phased pilots and waiver strategy: begin with targeted, time\u2011limited federal seed grants and state demonstrations (1115/1915/1332 or conditional grants) to test delivery, measure offsets, and limit short\u2011term federal/state fiscal cliffs (implementation guidance from node_3; political tactics from node_3_gap0) [2][3][4].  \n  3. Measurement and capacity investments up\u2011front: fund stratified per\u2011enrollee cost measurement, EHR/workflow integration, workforce training/coaching, and rigorous evaluation infrastructure to reveal true marginal costs and realize potential share\u2011in\u2011savings (implementation priorities from node_7; measurement guidance from node_3_gap0) [2][3][4].\n\n- Quick summary of expected benefits and primary risks\n  - Expected benefits: reduced poverty and material hardship, improved food security and health access, and measurable child\u2011development gains\u2014especially from cash transfers, SNAP, Medicaid coverage, and early\u2011childhood investments (evidence synthesized in node_5 and node_2) [1][2][3].  \n  - Primary risks: absent package\u2011level net fiscal estimates (no central net estimates in supplied materials), state administrative capacity shortfalls, churn/error risks during renewals, and political constraints on durable financing that can produce fiscal cliffs (nodes: node_6; node_3; node_7) [1][2][3].\n\n1. Synthesis of Key Findings\n\n1.1 Need and gaps in current federal supports (summary)\n- Scale and gaps: Major federal programs are large but incomplete: Medicaid (FY2020 federal spending \u2248 $649B; federal share \u2248 67%; enrollment \u2248 76M), SNAP (FY2024 spending \u2248 $99.8B; ~41.7M monthly participants; avg benefit \u2248 $187.20/month), refundable EITC (~$32B in 2019), and housing supports (~$29.9B in 2019) are headline anchors\u2014yet benefit levels, eligibility rules, and administrative fragmentation leave coverage and adequacy gaps (node_4; node_2) [1][2].  \n- Consequences: Persistent food insecurity, housing instability, unmet health and child\u2011care needs coexist with these programs, indicating unmet needs that justify additional federal action (node_2; node_4) [1][2].\n\n1.2 Measurable benefits of expansions (summary)\n- Empirical impacts: Expansions in cash transfers, nutrition assistance, health coverage, and early childhood programs reduce poverty and raise consumption/food security, with associated improvements in some health and child\u2011development outcomes (node_5; node_2) [1][2][3].  \n- Typical effect sizes & heterogeneity: Effect sizes vary by program design, benefit size, duration, conditionality, and context; some long\u2011run human\u2011capital gains are robust for cash and early\u2011childhood investments, while many gains attenuate when payments stop\u2014heterogeneity and uncertainty are substantial (node_5) [2][3].  \n- Uncertainty caveat: The supplied materials do not provide harmonized dollars\u2011per\u2011outcome metrics (e.g., $ per poverty\u2011point, $ per QALY) or package\u2011level effect syntheses\u2014so benefit magnitudes can be described qualitatively but not precisely quantified from the available sources (node_2; node_3) [1][3].\n\n1.3 Fiscal, implementation, and political constraints (summary)\n- Missing fiscal baseline: No package\u2011level gross/net federal cost estimates or quantified offsets (health/lifetime earnings) are present in the supplied materials; this analytic gap is central and material to any expansion decision (node_6; node_2) [1][3].  \n- Operational risks: State administrative capacity, high churn/renewal risk, potential fiscal cliffs from time\u2011limited matches, and administrative/IT/workforce constraints threaten fidelity and sustainability if scale\u2011up is rushed (node_7; node_3) [2][3][4].  \n- Political trade\u2011offs: Financing choices (permanent taxes vs. reallocated tax expenditures vs. temporary revenues or borrowing) have distinct distributional and political implications; absent yield/incidence data, political feasibility is uncertain and depends on sequencing, framing, and coalition building (node_3; node_3_gap0) [3][4].\n\n2. What Federal Programs Exist and Who They Serve (node: inventory)\n\n2.1 Major programs and their current scale\n- Medicaid: FY2020 federal spending \u2248 $649B; federal share \u2248 67%; enrollment \u2248 76M\u2014federal\u2013state match structure (FMAP) drives state exposure and uptake (node_4; node_3_gap0) [1].  \n- SNAP: FY2024 federal spending \u2248 $99.8B; average monthly participants \u2248 41.7M; avg benefit \u2248 $187.20/month (node_4) [2].  \n- Refundable EITC / SSI: refundable EITC \u2248 $32B (2019); SSI counts not fully enumerated in supplied material (node_4) [1].  \n- Housing supports: Housing Choice Vouchers/Public Housing federal spending \u2248 $29.9B (2019) (node_4) [1].  \n- Early childhood: Child Care & Development Fund median toddler base \u2248 $780/month (2019); consolidated federal totals and beneficiary counts for all early\u2011childhood programs not provided in supplied material (node_4) [1].\n\n2.2 Current spending and beneficiary counts (headline figures)\n- Headline anchors: Medicaid ~$649B (FY2020); SNAP ~$99.8B (FY2024); refundable EITC ~$32B (2019); housing ~$29.9B (2019). Per\u2011beneficiary and demographic reach vary by program and state; the supplied material includes limited per\u2011beneficiary averages but lacks full national per\u2011recipient cost tables for all programs (node_4; node_2) [1][2].\n\n3. Evidence on Impacts of Program Expansions (node: empirical effects)\n\n3.1 Cash transfers and refundable tax credits\n- Impacts: Reduce poverty incidence/intensity, raise consumption on essentials, and improve child outcomes in many settings; long\u2011run adult earnings and schooling gains are strongest for well\u2011designed cash and early\u2011childhood investments but vary by study (node_5; node_3) [2][3].  \n- Labor supply: Empirical labor\u2011supply responses are heterogeneous and typically modest in the supplied evidence; labor effects are program\u2011dependent and not central to the benefit case in the supplied sources (node_5) [2].\n\n3.2 Nutrition assistance (SNAP)\n- Impacts: Immediate improvements in food security and consumption; evidence of downstream health benefits in some longitudinal studies (node_5) [1][2]. Detailed cost\u2011offset estimates (healthcare spending reductions) are not provided in the assembled material.\n\n3.3 Health coverage expansions (Medicaid)\n- Impacts: Increased coverage leads to improved access and measurable health and mental\u2011health gains; evidence suggests potential financial protection and some mortality/access benefits in studied expansions, but the supplied materials do not present harmonized $/health metric conversions (node_5; node_2) [1][3].  \n\n3.4 Housing subsidies and homelessness prevention\n- Impacts: Vouchers and supports reduce housing instability and rent burden; evidence shows family and child benefits and complementarity with other supports, but per\u2011episode cost\u2011effectiveness estimates are not provided in the supplied material (node_5; node_2) [3].  \n\n3.5 Early\u2011childhood investments (care, preschool)\n- Impacts: Consistent evidence that early\u2011childhood programs can raise short\u2011 and long\u2011run educational and earnings outcomes for disadvantaged children, with some studies showing strong social returns; however, durability and generalizability vary by program and context, and scaling challenges are substantial (node_5; node_3) [2][3].  \n\n3.6 Cross\u2011program synergies and distributional impacts\n- Synergies: Combining cash, nutrition, health, and housing supports can amplify benefits (e.g., housing vouchers + cash + SNAP), especially for children in the lowest income strata (node_5; node_2) [2][3].  \n- Distributional nuance: The supplied evidence lacks full quantification of distributional impacts by quintile and geography; recommended reporting includes quintile\u2011 and state\u2011level incidence for any package (node_3_gap0; node_2) [3].\n\n4. Program\u2011level Cost\u2011effectiveness and Marginal Cost Evidence (node: cost\u2011effectiveness)\n\n4.1 Per\u2011beneficiary costs, marginal\u2011cost curves, and benefit\u2011per\u2011dollar metrics\n- Per\u2011beneficiary anchors (health/high\u2011cost contexts): supplied analyses report illustrative per\u2011beneficiary annual anchors \u2248 $48,000 (central for high\u2011cost predicted beneficiaries; median \u2248 $37,704) and \u2248 $7,000 for low\u2011cost beneficiaries (median \u2248 $3,406), with \u224825% of beneficiaries accounting for \u224869% of total costs\u2014figures come from cost\u2011concentration analyses in node_6/node_3 summaries [1].  \n- Limits: There are no harmonized marginal\u2011cost curves or $/outcome (e.g., $ per poverty\u2011point, $/QALY) metrics across program types in the supplied material; building these requires program\u2011level take\u2011up, unit costs, and modeled offsets (node_6; node_3_gap0) [1][3].\n\n4.2 Documented offsets and estimated savings\n- Evidence status: Behavioral elasticities and suggestive mechanisms imply potential offsets (e.g., reduced acute care use), but dollar\u2011quantified offsets/savings and timing are not present in the supplied sources; share\u2011in\u2011savings mechanisms are recommended where measurable short\u2011term savings are plausible (node_6; node_3) [3][4].  \n\n4.3 Key evidence gaps and sensitivity to assumptions\n- Major gaps: absence of package\u2011level net federal cost estimates, missing admin/build\u2011out cost estimates, unquantified offsets from improved health/earnings, and no revenue yield/incidence numbers for candidate financing options\u2014these drive wide sensitivity in any projection (node_6; node_2_gap0) [1][3].\n\n5. Fiscal Costs, Financing Options, and Distributional Trade\u2011offs (node: fiscal)\n\n5.1 Current knowledge: lack of package\u2011level net federal cost estimates\n- Status: The supplied materials do not include any package\u2011level net federal cost estimates or modeled offset arrays; analysts must produce gross and net estimates with sensitivity ranges as a precondition for permanent expansions (node_6; node_2_gap0) [3][1].\n\n5.2 Candidate financing options\n- Options overview: permanent tax increases (individual/corporate/wealth), reallocation of tax expenditures, targeted levies, temporary bridging revenues, borrowing/P3s for capital, use of share\u2011in\u2011savings or performance contracts, and federal allotments/conditional grants are candidate mechanisms\u2014each has distinct distributional and lifecycle trade\u2011offs (node_3_gap0; node_6) [3][4].  \n- Practical note: the supplied material contains no yield or incidence estimates for these options\u2014quantitative evaluation requires microsimulation and fiscal modeling (node_3_gap0) [3].\n\n5.3 Annual yields and distributional incidence (what to report)\n- Recommended reporting: for each financing option report annual yields, quintile\u2011level incidence, geographic incidence (state/territory), timing of revenues, and sensitivity ranges\u2014these are currently absent and required to evaluate trade\u2011offs (node_3_gap0) [3].\n\n5.4 Trade\u2011offs and political economy implications\n- Trade\u2011offs: Progressive tax financing aligns with durability but faces political resistance; reallocated tax expenditures can free funds but meet stakeholder opposition; temporary revenues are politically easier short term but risky for ongoing obligations; borrowing/P3s can smooth upfront needs for capital but raise lifecycle costs (node_3; node_6) [3][4].  \n- Political feasibility tactics: phased pilots, coalition building (providers, states, grassroots), and framing around targeting and offsets improve viability (node_3_gap0; node_3_gap0_node_3) [3][4].\n\n6. Implementation, Administrative Capacity, and Political Feasibility (node: implementation/politics)\n\n6.1 Federal\u2013state implementation structures and legal authorities\n- Key levers: FMAP formula (50% floor\u201483% cap), enhanced/time\u2011limited matches (e.g., ACA expansion ~90%), waivers (section 1115, 1915(c), 1332), grants vs. entitlements design, and enrollment/renewal rules materially shape federal exposure and state behavior (node_3_gap0; node_3_gap0_node_1) [1][2][3].\n\n6.2 Administrative capacity, churn, and operational barriers\n- Operational challenges: workforce shortages and burnout, insufficient training/coaching, weak organizational readiness, fragmented agency roles, IT/EHR/workflow barriers, and measurement/feedback gaps slow rollouts and raise admin costs\u2014piloting and up\u2011front measurement investments are critical mitigation strategies (node_7; node_3) [2][4].  \n\n6.3 Behavioral responses and equity considerations\n- Evidence gaps: the supplied materials do not supply comprehensive provider/client behavioral response estimates or disaggregated equity analyses; targeted empirical work and disaggregated monitoring are required to assess labor supply, take\u2011up, stigma, and subgroup effects (node_7; node_3_gap0) [2][3].\n\n6.4 Political\u2011feasibility lessons and case studies\n- Lessons: consortia and seed federal grants help overcome fragmentation; coalitions of providers, state champions, and grassroots groups are essential; safeguards are needed to avoid private\u2011partner co\u2011optation; phased, evidence\u2011driven sequencing with clear sustainability plans supports legislative buy\u2011in (node_3_gap0_node_3; node_3) [4][5][6].\n\n7. Integrating Evidence into a Policy Decision Framework (node: weighing trade\u2011offs)\n\n7.1 Criteria for deciding whether to scale up nationally\n- Required tests before national scale\u2011up:\n  - Package\u2011level net federal cost within acceptable fiscal ranges under alternative scenarios (with sensitivity to offsets).  \n  - Demonstrated implementation fidelity and manageable administrative error/churn in pilots.  \n  - Financing path with acceptable political and distributional properties (quintile and state incidence) (nodes: node_6; node_3_gap0) [3].\n\n7.2 Comparative assessment of program types\n- Relative ranking (based on available evidence and feasibility):\n  - Highest immediacy & implementation simplicity: federally administered cash transfers and SNAP expansions\u2014material immediate impacts and administrability are favorable (node_2; node_5) [2][3].  \n  - Medium: Medicaid/health coverage expansions\u2014large benefits but complex federal\u2013state match and legislative steps required (node_2; node_3_gap0) [1][3].  \n  - More complex & costly: housing and early\u2011childhood scale\u2011ups\u2014high potential long\u2011run returns but greater administrative complexity and slower timelines (node_5; node_3) [2][3].\n\n7.3 Example package options (prioritized bundles) and what must be modeled\n- Illustrative prioritized bundles (examples to be fully modeled):\n  1. Targeted cash + SNAP uplift for poorest households (model gross/net costs, take\u2011up, immediate poverty reduction, state impacts) (node_2; node_5).  \n  2. Early\u2011childhood expansion + workforce supports (model long\u2011run schooling/earnings returns, multi\u2011decadal PVs) (node_5; node_3).  \n  3. Housing voucher pilots + Medicaid wrap in high\u2011capacity states (pilot to test delivery and offsets) (node_3; node_2).  \n- Modeling needs: for each bundle compute gross federal costs by year, present\u2011value net cost with modeled offsets, quintile/state incidence, and sensitivity analyses (node_6; node_3_gap0) [3].\n\n8. Policy Sequencing and Recommended Actions\n\n8.1 Phase 1 \u2014 Immediate actions (pilots and analytic preconditions)\n- Launch targeted pilots and federal seed grants (prioritize cash transfers, SNAP expansions, and selected early\u2011childhood investments) in higher\u2011capacity states via waivers or conditional grants; mandate collection of per\u2011enrollee cost, outcomes, churn, and admin error data (node_3; node_7) [2][3].  \n- Require package\u2011level modeling: before any permanent national scale\u2011up, produce gross/net federal cost estimates with sensitivity ranges, modeled offsets (health, earnings), and quintile/state incidence (node_6; node_2_gap0) [3].\n\n8.2 Phase 2 \u2014 Conditional scale\u2011up rules\n- Pre\u2011specified triggers for national expansion: fidelity and outcome thresholds met in pilots, net federal costs within modeled acceptable ranges, and a financing plan with acceptable distributional footprints; extend temporary enhanced matches only with cliff\u2011mitigation measures and automatic review points (node_3_gap0_node_1) [3].\n\n8.3 Phase 3 \u2014 Full rollout and sustainment measures\n- If pilots and fiscal models are favorable, proceed to national scale\u2011up with: investments in workforce/IT, long\u2011term funding commitments (or legislated financing path), per\u2011enrollee cost reporting, and selective share\u2011in\u2011savings trials to capture offsets\u2014use federal allotments/conditional grants where long\u2011term federal exposure would otherwise be large (node_3; node_6) [3][4].\n\n9. Monitoring, Evaluation, and Pre\u2011specified Triggers\n\n9.1 Outcome metrics to track\n- Poverty rate, material hardship indicators (food security, housing stability), health outcomes, child development and schooling indicators, earnings (short\u2011 and long\u2011run) (node_5; node_3) [2][3].\n\n9.2 Implementation/performance metrics\n- Net federal cost (annual and PV), per\u2011enrollee cost, administrative error/overpayment rates, churn/renewal rates, state uptake and administrative capacity indicators (node_6; node_7) [3][4].\n\n9.3 Decision triggers and contingency rules\n- Pause/adjust if observed net federal cost growth materially exceeds modeled central projections (numeric thresholds to be specified once package models exist).  \n- Pause/adjust if administrative error/churn exceed pre\u2011specified benchmarks.  \n- Tie sunset/extension of enhanced matches to measured outcomes and fiscal stress indicators (node_3_gap0_node_1; node_3) [3].\n\n10. Uncertainties, Risks, and Decision Rules\n- Catalog of key uncertainties: fiscal offsets (health/earnings) magnitude and timing; marginal\u2011cost escalation with scale; behavioral responses (beneficiaries/providers); state heterogeneity in capacity and fiscal exposure; revenue yields and incidence for financing options (node_6; node_3; node_7) [1][3].  \n- Explicit decision rule: proceed from pilot \u2192 conditional scale only if (a) package\u2011level net federal costs (with sensitivity ranges) are within acceptable policy bounds and funded by a credible financing path, and (b) pilots demonstrate implementation fidelity and expected outcome attainment; otherwise pause or scale back (node_1_gap0_node_1_gap0_node_1) [3].\n\n11. Required Analytic Work and Data Needs (next steps)\n- Immediate analytic priorities:\n  1. Produce package\u2011level fiscal models: gross costs by year, PV net costs, sensitivity ranges, and modeled offsets (health and lifetime earnings) with documentation of behavioral/timing assumptions (node_6; node_2_gap0) [3].  \n  2. Compute harmonized cost\u2011effectiveness metrics: $ per schooling\u2011year, $ per QALY/DALY averted, PV net federal cost per outcome, stratified by income quintile and state (node_3_gap0_node_1) [3].  \n  3. Design and run pilots: 1115/1915(c)/1332 or conditional\u2011grant pilots stratified by state administrative capacity to measure churn, error, admin costs, and realized offsets (node_3; node_7) [2][3].  \n  4. Fiscal microsimulations: estimate annual yields and quintile incidence for candidate financing options to match revenue to net program cost (node_3_gap0) [3].  \n- Responsible analytic actors and timeline: CBO, Treasury, HHS, independent evaluators, and academic teams should coordinate; initial pilot and modeling work can be staged over 12\u201336 months to produce the preconditions for conditional scale\u2011up (node_3_gap0; node_1_gap0_node_1) [3].\n\n12. Appendices (to populate in full report)\n- A. Detailed program spending and beneficiary tables \u2014 baseline anchors provided in node_4 (Medicaid, SNAP, EITC, housing) but require updates and expansions for all programs [1][2].  \n- B. Summary of empirical studies and effect sizes \u2014 syntheses exist qualitatively in node_5; systematic effect\u2011size tables need to be compiled.  \n- C. Template specifications for package\u2011level fiscal models \u2014 include gross cost inputs, offset elasticities, admin/build\u2011out cost modules, and financing scenarios (per guidance in node_6).  \n- D. Pilot design templates and evaluation plans \u2014 stratify by state capacity, include fidelity supports and per\u2011enrollee cost measurement (node_7).  \n- E. Political\u2011feasibility case studies and legislative strategy notes \u2014 build from coalition and framing lessons in node_3_gap0_node_3.\n\nConclusion (aligning with root recommendation)\n- Conditional approval: The balance of evidence supports substantially increasing federal social services in principle because of large unmet needs and empirical benefits from cash, nutrition, health coverage, and early\u2011childhood investments (node_2; node_5) [1][2][3].

        "Published: Jul 30, 2015. Publicly Released: Aug 31, 2015. \nMore than 80 federal programs (including 6 tax expenditures) provide aid to people with low incomes, based on GAO's survey of relevant federal agencies. Medicaid (the largest by far), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) comprised almost two-thirds of fiscal year 2013 federal obligations of $742 billion for these programs. Aid is most often targeted to groups of the low-income population, such as people with disabilities and workers with children. Survey responses showed that criteria used to determine eligibility vary greatly; most common were variants of the federal poverty guidelines, based on the Census Bureau's official poverty measure.\nIn 2013, 48.7 million people (15.5 percent), including many households with children, lived in poverty in the United States, based on Census's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). This measure takes into account certain expenses and federal and state government benefits not included in the official poverty measure. The SPM is not used to determine program eligibility; however, it does provide more information than the official measure on household resources available to meet living expenses. In 2013, the SPM poverty threshold ranged from $21,397 to $25,639 for a family of four, depending on housing situations. Based on six mutually exclusive household types GAO developed, individuals in a household headed by a person with a disability or a single parent had the highest rates of poverty using the SPM, while childless or married parent households had larger numbers of people in poverty using the SPM.",
        "In 2012, the most recent year of data available, GAO estimated that 106 million people, or one-third of the U.S. population, received benefits from at least one or more of eight selected federal low-income programs: Additional Child Tax Credit, EITC, SNAP, SSI, and four others. Almost two-thirds of the eight programs' recipients were in households with children, including many married families. More than 80 percent of recipients also lived in households with some earned income during the year. Without these programs' benefits, GAO estimated that 25 million of these recipients would have been below the SPM poverty threshold. Of the eight programs, EITC and SNAP moved the most people out of poverty, however, the majority of recipients of each of the programs were estimated to have incomes above the SPM threshold, after accounting for receipt of benefits.\nResearch suggests that assistance from selected means-tested low-income programs can encourage people's participation in the labor force, but have mixed effects on the number of hours they work. Changes in certain low-income programs through the years, including the EITC, have enhanced incentives for people to join the labor force, according to studies. While workers who receive means-tested benefits face benefit reductions as their earnings rise, research shows that various factors limit how much people change their work behavior in response. For example, people may not be aware of such changing interactions in a complex tax and benefit system or be able to control the number of hours they work, according to studies. Research also shows that enhancing work incentives can create difficult policy trade-offs, including raising program costs or failing to provide adequate assistance to those in need.\n##  Why GAO Did This Study",
        "The federal government provides assistance aimed at helping people with low-incomes who may earn too little to meet their basic needs, cannot support themselves through work, or who are disadvantaged in other ways. With fiscal pressures facing the federal government and the demands placed on aid programs, GAO was asked to examine federal low-income programs.\nThis report (1) describes federal programs (including tax expenditures) targeted to people with low incomes, (2) identifies the number and selected household characteristics of people in poverty, (3) identifies the number, poverty status, and household characteristics of selected programs' recipients, and (4) examines research on how selected programs may affect incentives to work. For a list of low-income programs that were $100 million in obligations or more in fiscal year 2013, GAO consulted with the Congressional Research Service; surveyed and interviewed officials at relevant federal agencies; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency guidance. GAO also conducted analyses on low-income individuals using Census data on the SPM and official poverty measure and microsimulation data from the Urban Institute that adjusts for under-reporting of benefit receipt in Census survey data. To examine labor force effects, GAO reviewed economic literature. Selected low-income programs were large in dollars and helped meet a range of basic needs.\nGAO is not making new recommendations in this report. GAO clarified portions in response to comments from one agency.\nFor more information, contact Kay Brown at (202) 512-7215 or ."

        "In the half century since President Lyndon B. Johnson declared an unconditional War on Poverty, the Federal Government has invested in strategies that aim to relieve and prevent poverty. Partly as a result of these programs, and a large number of additions and reforms since then, between 1967 and 2012, poverty measured by a measure that accounts for tax and transfer payments 9.8 percentage points, or 38 percent. In 2013, income and nutrition assistance programs lifted 46 million people, including 10 million children, out of the poverty. Medicaid has also resulted in better health care for tens of millions of Americans. Another 16 million people have gained coverage the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage expansions, as of early 2015.\nInnovative economic research is increasingly finding that these programs have long-run benefits for the children in families that receive them. These studies often drawn upon large \u201cadministrative\u201d data sets that are collected in the process of running government programs. These data sources frequently allow researchers to track families over long periods of time with limited attrition, offer much larger sample sizes, and suffer from less missing data than major household surveys. These improvements in data quality have coincided with a \u201c\u201d in economics that has greatly expanded the use of randomized trials and \u201cquasi-experimental\u201d research designs that exploit natural experiments to estimate the causal impact of the programs.\nThe following is a selection of research in this area for five major current programs\u2014early education, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (SNAP), housing vouchers, and Medicaid\u2014plus one historical income support program.\n1.

        "Cash transfers (CTs), for all their evident success in relieving poverty, have been criticised for failing to incorporate transformative elements into their programme design. In recent years changes have been introduced into the design of CT programmes that go some way towards addressing this concern. This article critically engages the meaning of transformative social protection and introduces a collection of papers that examine whether and under what conditions cash transfers can be \u2018transformative\u2019. Among the issues addressed are whether CTs can be catalysts leading to positive changes, material, subjective and relational in the lives of poor people; what are the social effects of CTs for beneficiaries, their households and communities; and can they foster horizontal relationships within communities and vertical relationship with the state through developing forms of social accountability and citizenship engagement?\nWith the eradication of extreme poverty as a priority Millennium Development Goal, cash transfer programmes (CTPs) spread rapidly across the world to reach more than 750 million people in low and middle-income countries in the global south by 2010 (Arnold, Conway, & Greenslade, ). As new programmes multiplied, older ones expanded their coverage to reach significant numbers of targeted populations in the lowest decile. Driving the expansion of CTs was their widely acclaimed record of positive results. Evidence from across the world confirmed that well targeted, well designed social transfer programmes were an effective and affordable instrument for reducing the incidence and intensity of household poverty with measureable improvements in child health and educational attendance (Arnold et al., ; Cecchini & Madariaga, ; Fiszbein et al., ; Soares, Soares, Medeiros, & Guerreiro Os\u00f3rio, ). One commentator, echoing a commonly expressed view, went as far as to state that they were \u2018as close as you can come to a magic bullet in development\u2019.",
        "The articles in the first section of the Special Issue find that CTPs have largely positive outcomes including enhanced self esteem at the individual level, as well as enabling greater participation in social interaction. However in some cases there can be negative side effects of being part of the programme such as feelings of humiliation, stigma and shame due to reliance on the transfer for support. The article by Samuels and Stavropoulou discusses findings from the Transforming Cash Transfers project in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East; that by Attah et al. draws on evaluations of CTPs in east, west and southern Africa, while Adato et al. focus on a South African case study. There is evidence in all three articles of the effects of cash transfer programmes on psychosocial health and behaviour. Both Attah et al. and Samuels and Stavropoulou look at how psychosocial wellbeing affects both individuals and their relation to others. Attah et al. present findings from a mixed method evaluation of a cash transfer in Kenya, and from cross-country qualitative research from Ghana, Zimbabwe and Lesotho. They pay particular attention to the intrinsic and instrumental dimensions of psychosocial wellbeing showing that cash transfers can have positive impacts on psychosocial wellbeing leading to further positive impacts on educational performance, participation in social life and empowerment for decision-making."

        "Research has shown that poverty experienced during early childhood is associated with worse child, youth, and adult outcomes. Aspects of development affected by poverty early in life include learning, educational attainment, physical and mental health, and adult earnings. The negative effects of poverty may be particularly strong when it is experienced during early childhood, relative to later in childhood and in adolescence. Developmental theory suggests that family processes play an important role in explaining associations between income poverty and children\u2019s outcomes. However, the extent to which income support and anti-poverty initiatives causally affect family processes among families with low incomes is not well understood.\nMany longitudinal, non-experimental studies have established the cascading effects of economic hardship and low income, which contribute to parental psychological distress and reduce the quality of family relationships, parenting, and child outcomes. The goal of this randomized controlled study is to examine the extent to which a multi-year cash transfer program\u2014which provides an ~$4000 annual unconditional cash transfer, distributed monthly as a cash gift on a debit card to participants who had given birth (henceforth, mothers) and had prior-year household income below the federal poverty threshold\u2014affects economic hardship, maternal well-being, family relationships, and parenting across the first three years of life.",
        "Most conditional and unconditional cash transfer programs have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Experimental evaluations of these programs typically include some measures of economic well-being as well as physical and mental health, but few include measures of family processes. Systematic reviews of these international studies find that, on average, cash transfer programs improve food security and indicators of economic well-being as well as mental health. A recent meta-analysis of 45 conditional and unconditional cash transfer evaluations conducted in low- and middle-income countries found average effect sizes of +0.13 on adult subjective well-being and \u22120.07 on mental health problems (primarily depressive symptoms). In addition, most cash transfer programs either reduce intimate partner violence or do not affect it at all. Baranov et al.\u2019s meta-analysis found that cash transfer programs reduce intimate partner violence by 2\u20134% depending on the type of violence measured.",
        "However, systematic reviews suggest considerable heterogeneity in the estimated impacts of cash transfer programs on parent and child well-being, both across and within studies. McGuire et al.\u2019s meta-analysis found that unconditional cash transfers had larger impacts than conditional ones, and that impacts declined over time after the payments ended. Yet not all results are consistent\u2014an evaluation of a unconditional cash transfer program in Ecuador found that monthly cash transfers amounting to 10% of household income improved young children\u2019s development among families with the lowest incomes, but generated null to negative effects on maternal mental health among those same families. The same cash transfer in Ecuador reduced emotional violence in households for mothers with higher educational attainment, but not for mothers with lower educational attainment. Among mothers with lower educational attainment, if the mother\u2019s educational attainment was higher than her partner\u2019s, the cash transfer appeared to increase emotional violence."

        "#  Improving Lives Through Cash Transfers \nA cash transfer is a payment of money to a recipient, either as a one-time or a repeat payment. In humanitarian contexts, cash transfers are often used to alleviate poverty and provide assistance in emergencies and in economic development. Evidence demonstrates that cash transfer programs, growing around the globe since the mid-1990s, are a cost-effective way to improve the lives of poor households across many domains.\nThese programs can impact a wide range of development outcomes because recipients purchase food, invest in agriculture, improve their shelter, and pay for medical and education expenses. Cash transfers address poor households\u2019 severe budget constraints and investment needs ranging across education, health, household, and business.\n_Read about our work in:_\nCash transfer programs come in many designs that vary by conditionality, targeted population, size of grant, frequency of grant, and length of the program. They are one of the most studied development programs today with much evidence demonstrating their success, yet there remain questions about how variations in programs can affect their impact. Does adding resources or services to the cash transfers maximize their benefits? How can they be adapted for use in refugee camps or with migrant populations? \nAIR\u2019s extensive expertise in evaluating cash transfers provides a unique ability to assess commonalities and differences across cash transfer programs. AIR took this opportunity to synthesize findings across studies to identify lessons for designing cash transfer programming.\nWhile impact evaluations are an essential component for creating a rigorous evidence base on the effectiveness of cash transfer programs, mixed-methods evaluations of program design and implementation fidelity are critical to understand how cash transfer programs work.",
        "This program aims to reduce child poverty, improve child well-being, and promote access to basic services for families. It has three components: a regular cash transfer, distributed to the primary caregiver of children ages 0-2; a social behavior change communication package around positive nutrition and hygiene practices; and family support services for the most vulnerable program participants. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) Mozambique hired AIR and its partners to conduct a 24-month, longitudinal impact evaluation and process evaluation of this program\u2019s start-up phase.\nBased on the evidence that AIR generated, the Government of Mozambique decided to expand the \"cash and care\" model, aiming to reach 500,000 children for the period from 2022 to 2026 in 10 provinces. The expansion plan aims to cover approximately 20 percent of the children aged 0-2. \nAlthough the number of refugee children enrolled in school in Turkey has increased significantly in recent years, a number of obstacles mean nearly 40 percent of Syrian children living in Turkey remain out of school. UNICEF Turkey contracted with AIR to conduct a rigorous program evaluation of the Conditional Cash Transfer for Education for Syrians and Other Refugees, which provides bimonthly cash payments to eligible households and targeted support in the form of child protection outreach visits to households with children deemed to be most at risk. \nThe relationship between happiness and income is at the center of a vibrant debate, as emotional states are an important determinant of health and social behavior. This journal article discusses whether a government-run unconditional cash transfer paid directly to women in poor households had an impact on self-reported happiness.\n### Cash Transfers Explained: How Cash Empowers Poor Families in Zambia (Video)"

        "Cash transfer programs have emerged as potent tools for alleviating poverty and enhancing the living conditions of the most deprived households in developing nations. Such initiatives have now become integral components of social protection systems in many developing countries, including Pakistan. Evaluating the efficacy of these safety nets is crucial to comprehend their value in terms of public expenditure. This research employed a well-being index to gauge the impact of unconditional cash transfers on the socioeconomics of recipients. By employing three rounds of the BISP impact assessment survey conducted in 2011, 2016, and 2019. The study measured the overall impact of cash transfers on well-being by utilizing Principal Component Analysis in conjunction with a Difference-in-Differences Quasi-Experimental design over the years. The findings of the study indicate that between 2011 and 2016, the socioeconomic status declined for both treatment and control groups, but the reduction was less pronounced among those who received treatment compared to the control group with insignificant. From 2016 to 2019, there was a marginal positive increase in socioeconomic status, although it was of insignificance. Overall, the well-being of both the control and treatment groups decreased from 2011 to 2019, with a slightly more pronounced improvement observed in the treatment group. This trend suggests that the impact of the BISP unconditional cash transfer program had a limited effect on altering the well-being of the beneficiaries. The lack of substantial impact from the BISP\u2019s cash transfers on household well-being can be attributed to factors such as inflation, unemployment, economic slowdown, payment challenges, insufficient funding, and gaps between installments. The government of Pakistan should reconsider the substantial investment in BISP within the context of value for money",
        "### Similar content being viewed by others\nCash transfers have emerged as a powerful tool in reducing poverty and improving the wellbeing of the poorest households in developing countries (Baird et al. ). These transfers provide direct monetary assistance to low-income families with the primary objective of improving their income and increasing their consumption of essential commodities (Handa and Davis ). According to recent estimates, cash transfers have already benefitted approximately 718 million people in developing countries, with the numbers expected to rise in the coming years (De Groot et al. ).\nIn the short term, these transfers can provide resources that families can use to meet immediate needs like food and shelter, while in the long term, they can enable families to invest in education, health, and other productive activities to break out of the poverty cycle (Ayoo ). Cash transfers can also empower women, improve school attendance, and contribute to better nutrition and health outcomes, particularly in patriarchal societies where women have limited access to resources and decision-making (Sugiyama and Hunter ).\nCash transfer schemes are now an integral part of the social protection systems of many developing countries due to poverty and social well-being being significant obstacles to sustainable development. Education, health, and women\u2019s empowerment are particularly critical areas that need to be addressed (De Groot et al. ). Despite progress made over the past few decades, the challenges remain substantial. For instance, although more than one billion individuals were lifted out of extreme poverty between 1990 and 2011, 258 million children and youth worldwide are still out of school. Moreover, 828 million people in 2021 do not have sufficient food to eat (UNICEF ; WFP and UNICEF ).",
        "Additionally, this research investigates the differential impact of socioeconomic and cash transfers on household and beneficiaries\u2019 characteristics. The findings of this research are crucial for informing evidence-based policy analysis to scale up contributions to cash transfer programs. This is particularly relevant in the context of national government commitments to improving value for money, expanding coverage, ensuring financial sustainability, clarifying the level and type of impact, and adequately reflecting these in social wellbeing. Moreover, this research aims to take a strategic approach to providing technical assistance on national cash transfer systems, in line with the government\u2019s commitment to reducing poverty, improving health, education, and empowering women.\nIn the world, across 72 to 149 Social Safety Nets (SSN)/Social Assistance (SA) programs have been launched in various developing and developed nations to alleviate poverty, increase well-being, social development, and safeguard against economic shocks (Saleem and World Bank ). In developing nations, tailored interventions have long been used to reduce poverty and promote social well-being. Ivaschenko et al. () investigate trends in SSN programme coverage, spending, and programme performance throughout the world and find evidence of an increasing commitment to SSN/SA programmes, emphasizing their substantial contribution to poverty reduction efforts. However, they also stress the continuous difficulty of low programme coverage and benefits, implying that while these programmes have made achievements, more effort is needed to achieve meaningful poverty reduction."

        "The social safety net\u2019s disjointedness and complexity require needy families to interact multiple times with government agencies to access benefits. Some complexity is necessary to ensure only eligible families receive assistance. However, the myriad possible program and service combinations create a bureaucratic web that government officials and benefit recipients must navigate.\nThe largest share of safety-net spending goes to means-tested health insurance programs, including Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. According to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, total Medicaid spending in fiscal year (FY) 2020 topped $649 billion, of which the federal government supported 67 percent, and the program covered approximately 76 million individuals. Medicaid overshadows other safety-net spending and deserves its own reforms (covered in Chapter 5 of this volume).\nThe remaining major means-tested safety-net programs (including refundable credits paid under the EITC and CTC) cost taxpayers over $300 billion annually in just federal outlays, as Table 1 illustrates. Excluding health care, the largest programs in terms of recipients and dollars cover four areas: income support, food and nutrition assistance, childcare, and housing and energy assistance. Table 1 briefly describes major programs and their 2019 costs before significant increases related to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTable 1.

        "For medical services used by most Medicaid enrollees\u2014those who were not made eligible by the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\u2014the share of Medicaid costs paid by the federal government is specified by the federal medical assistance percentage rate (FMAP rate). The FMAP rate is determined by a formula that provides a higher rate of federal reimbursement for states with lower per capita income relative to the national average and a lower rate for higher-income states. By law, a state's FMAP rate can be no less than 50 percent and no more than 83 percent. The national average matching rate over the 2024\u20132032 period for services provided to those enrollees is projected to be 60 percent, with states contributing the remaining 40 percent. In 2021, federal spending governed by the FMAP formula was $397 billion, or about 75 percent of total federal Medicaid spending. Federal spending for states with FMAP rates set at the 50 percent floor accounted for 38 percent of that amount.",
        "The federal government's share of costs for medical services is considerably larger for enrollees who became eligible for Medicaid because of the optional expansion of eligibility under the ACA. That law allowed states to expand eligibility to all adults under age 65 (including parents and adults without dependent children) who have income below 138 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. (Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have adopted the expansion.) For those who are eligible as a result, the federal government's share of Medicaid costs is fixed at 90 percent and does not vary by state. That higher matching rate was made available\u2014even though those enrollees' health risks are typically lower than the health risks of some other eligible groups, such as the elderly and disabled\u2014in order to lower the financial cost to states of covering a group that had not generally been covered previously. In 2021, federal spending for services provided to those newly eligible enrollees was $99 billion, or about 20 percent of total federal Medicaid spending.",
        "The federal government's share of administrative expenses is also specified by statute and varies by the category of such costs, but not by state. The federal government's share of general administrative expenses is 50 percent; however, for 25 specified categories of administrative costs, the federal share ranges from about 70 percent to 100 percent. For example, the federal government pays 75 percent of the cost of employing skilled medical professionals for Medicaid administration, 75 percent of the cost of utilization review (the process of determining the appropriateness and medical necessity of various health care services), 90 percent of the cost of developing systems to manage claims and information, and 100 percent of the cost of prescription-drug monitoring programs. The overall average federal share for administrative expenses was 62 percent in 2021. That year, federal spending for Medicaid administration was $20 billion, or about 5 percent of total federal Medicaid spending.\nThis option consists of three alternatives, each of which would go into effect in October 2023.\n  * Under the first alternative, the federal government's share for all categories of administrative spending would be 50 percent.\n  * Under the second alternative, the 50 percent floor on the FMAP rate that applies to medical services for enrollees not made eligible by the ACA would be removed. Consequently, FMAP rates would fall below 50 percent for states with the highest per capita income. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this alternative would affect 13 states, and the new matching rates for those states would be between 4 percent and 49.75 percent.\n  * Under the third alternative, the federal share of medical expenditures for enrollees made eligible by the ACA would be based on the same FMAP formula that applies to all other enrollees."

        "# Eliminating the Medicaid Expansion Federal Match Rate: State-by-State Estimates\nThere are under consideration in Congress to significantly to help pay for an extension of expiring tax cuts. Medicaid is the primary program providing comprehensive health and long-term care to people living in the U.S. and accounts for nearly [$1 out of every $5](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-the-basics/) spent on health care. Medicaid is administered by states within broad federal rules and jointly funded by states and the federal government, meaning restrictions in federal Medicaid spending could leave states with about how to offset reductions. This analysis examines the potential impacts on states and Medicaid enrollees of one prominent proposal, which would eliminate the 90% federal match rate for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion, which currently covers over 20 million people. Key takeaways include:\n  * This analysis explores the impact of eliminating the ACA expansion match rate under two scenarios. The first assumes that states maintain Medicaid expansion coverage and pick up new expansion costs, resulting in a decrease of 10% (or $626 billion) in federal Medicaid spending and an increase of 17% (or $626 billion) in state Medicaid spending across all states over a 10-year period.\n  * The second scenario assumes that states drop the ACA Medicaid expansion in response to the elimination of the 90% federal match rate. This would result in a 25% (or $1.7 trillion) decrease in federal Medicaid spending and a 5% (or $186 billion) decrease in state Medicaid spending across all states over a 10-year period. This would also cut total Medicaid spending by nearly one-fifth (or $1.9 trillion), and nearly a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees (20 million people) would lose coverage.\n  * Only states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion would see any spending or enrollment impacts under this policy proposal, though changes vary by state.",
        "## What is the proposed policy change?\nStates that have implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion currently receive a 90%[federal match rate or \u201cFMAP\u201d](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-the-basics/)for adults covered through the expansion, meaning the federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion enrollees. The ACA expanded Medicaid coverage to nearly all adults with incomes up to 138% of the ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). However, a effectively made the decision to implement the Medicaid expansion an option for states. (including DC) have since adopted Medicaid expansion, and Medicaid expansion enrollees nearly a quarter of Medicaid enrollment (as of March 2024) and one-fifth of total Medicaid spending (as of FY 2023). The FMAP for services used by people eligible through traditional Medicaid is determined by a formula set in statute. The formula is designed so that the federal government provides a match rate of at least 50% and provides a higher match rate for states with lower average per capita income. For FY 2026, the traditional from 50% to 77%.\nThis analysis estimates the impact of eliminating the enhanced FMAP for adults in the Medicaid expansion. The analysis assumes that, starting in FY 2026, expenditures for people eligible in the Medicaid expansion would be matched at each state\u2019s traditional 2026 FMAP rate. Details regarding the design of this policy change have yet to be released, and the details of proposed legislation may differ from the assumptions made to complete this analysis. This is also only one of the various Medicaid policy changes that have been suggested and estimates would change if multiple policies were considered together.\n## What are the potential impacts on Medicaid spending and enrollment?",
        "This analysis does not make assumptions about specific state behavioral responses and instead examines the impact of eliminating the ACA expansion match rate under two scenarios. These scenarios are designed to illustrate the range of potential policy change effects; in practice, each state may respond to the policy change differently. While some states may choose to continue ACA Medicaid expansion coverage with substantially reduced federal funding, many likely would not given the extra spending that would be required. The analysis also excludes secondary effects such as people who lose coverage through the Medicaid expansion enrolling in Medicaid under other eligibility pathways or enrolling in private health coverage. The estimates presented here are not directly comparable to the from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) because CBO\u2019s estimates account for assumptions about state behavioral responses and other secondary effects.\n  * All expansion states pick up new expansion costs. Expansion enrollment and total spending would remain constant while costs shift from the federal government to the states.\n  * All states drop the ACA Medicaid expansion, resulting in changes to enrollment as well as total, federal, and state spending."

        "How does Medicaid expansion generate savings to offset such costs? Medicaid expansion allows states to access an enhanced federal match for some people who would otherwise be covered by traditional Medicaid (). Given that states pay between 25 percent and 50 percent of the cost for a traditional Medicaid beneficiary but only 10 percent of the cost for an expansion beneficiary, these savings can be substantial. States can save from 15 cents to 40 cents on every dollar of care it can shift to expansion (assuming 2020 expansion match rates).\nPrior research identifies several types of expansion beneficiaries who would likely receive traditional Medicaid in the absence of expansion. Some are people who would have been covered through specific Medicaid programs, such as Section 1115 waivers or the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program. Some are people who used to spend down assets or pursue a disability designation to qualify for Medicaid that now qualify for expansion. The populations affected vary from state to state, depending on the specifics of their traditional Medicaid programs.\nWhile researchers have a clear understanding of how expansion may reduce states\u2019 traditional Medicaid spending, calculating the magnitude of these savings is difficult. In expansion states, we only observe what happened with expansion \u2014 not what these states would have spent had they not expanded Medicaid."

        "Under the \u2019s 90 percent federal reimbursement percentage, $100 of financing gimmicks yields $900 in federal funds for the state. Under the average state\u2019s 60 percent federal reimbursement for traditional Medicaid recipients, $100 of financing gimmicks yields $150 in federal funds for the state. Money laundering for spending on the expansion population thus has a rate of return six times higher for the average state\u2014and more so for wealthier states that receive lower federal reimbursements for traditional recipients.\nThe federal government\u2019s near-total subsidization of the expansion group dramatically weakens states\u2019 incentives to enforce eligibility rules. When ineligible individuals receive benefits through the expansion group, states bear almost none of the cost. On the other hand, ineligible enrollment in Medicaid allows governors and state legislators to boast of reducing the uninsured rate, expanding health coverage for their constituents, and supporting local hospitals and insurers offering Medicaid plans. In essence, state policymakers reap the political benefits of allowing large numbers of ineligible enrollees in Medicaid while federal taxpayers foot the bill.\nDifferences in federal matching rates also create strong financial motives for states to classify individuals eligible for Medicaid under traditional pathways as expansion enrollees. For example, if the annual cost for a Medicaid enrollee is $10,000, states save $3,000 per year by placing them in the expansion group with a 90 percent federal match, compared to the 60 percent match for the traditional group. Research suggests that these types of reclassifications may be widespread, affecting millions of enrollees and substantially inflating federal spending on ."

        "As the foregoing suggests, strong matching requirements are the exception rather than the rule in federal grant programs. In fact, strong matching requirements present a tradeoff to federal policy-making officials. Many grants have the objective of providing a minimum floor of services across the nation and across all states or localities. From this perspective, strong matching requirements\u2014although prompting greater deliberation and oversight by state and local officials\u2014may also serve to discourage participation by these governments, thereby frustrating the provision of uniform minimum services throughout the country. The impacts of matching on grant participation can be particularly severe for fiscally hard-pressed entities for whom raising the nonfederal share constitutes a greater burden than for wealthier jurisdictions. Federal policy makers can adjust matching rates to reflect the differential fiscal capacity across the nation by varying the matching formula or by waiving matching for certain governments. Indeed, the federal Medicaid program allocates federal funds through a matching formula that provides a higher federal share to states with lower per capita incomes, as a proxy for fiscal capacity. However, for most programs, the matching rate is either lowered or eliminated, recognizing the importance that federal policy makers place on ensuring maximum participation in grant programs."

It will also provide recommendations for future research efforts, to be informed by key stakeholders, aimed at developing implementation practice capacity to improve the implementation of EBPs and client outcomes.\n##  Issues for Consideration in Implementation Practice\n### Challenges to implementation of evidence-based practices\nAlthough the promotion of EBPs in health services represented a critical advancement in behavioral health care, the well-intentioned push towards the use of EBPs often fails to close the gap between the best available research and practice. EBPs must be effectively matched to community needs, implemented with fidelity to the standards of the intervention, and integrated within regular practices, so they may be sustained over time to ensure better outcomes for consumers. An organization adopting an EBP without first considering implementation and its associated barriers may not be able to ensure effective outcomes among clients. To achieve positive outcomes, EBPs must not simply be implemented but implemented with quality. However, behavioral health organizations and practitioners face significant challenges to successful implementation. These include the following: (1) being able to access and understand research findings and interpret them for the needs of their clients, agency, and community; (2) being able to identify and select EBPs they can afford; (3) being able to do the actual work of implementing the EBP through staff training, instituting new policies, and negotiating new contracts; and (4) integrating these changes so these efforts can be sustained.",
        "Practitioners may also have difficulties in matching EBPs that are often developed with very narrow and specific populations, with their more diverse clientele. Those they serve may suffer from multiple, complex issues bridging mental and physical health concerns, historic disparities and discrimination, poverty, mobility, and education. A topic that has caused tension in the research community is the discussion of fidelity and adaption. While many argue that adaptations are necessary to meet the needs of a specific setting, others postulate that an EBP that has been adapted may compromise the core elements of the program and be less effective when compared to the original program. Although fidelity has become the \u201cgold standard\u201d for successful program implementation, it may not take into consideration how a program fits within a context. In addition, organizational characteristics such as readiness for change, climate, staffing, leadership, and funding can significantly impact the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of EBPs. Sustainability may require long-term commitments to facilitate change, including the support of new policies, procedures, and infrastructure enhancements. Supporting implementation and sustainability may require new partnerships and collaborations, sufficient funding, and ongoing problem-solving. illustrates the core challenges of translating implementation science into implementation practice.\nCore Challenges of Translating Implementation Science into Implementation Practice",
        "A significant amount of IS research is often conducted with limited collaboration or input from key stakeholders (i.e., clients, practitioners, and service organizations). This may result in an implementation strategy that does not take real-world barriers into consideration, that may be used incorrectly, and/or that is unable to be replicated. In order to develop tangible, applicable, and sustainable strategies for capacity building among practitioners and service organizations in implementation practice, it is essential that the strategies are created and tested in collaboration with the key stakeholders intended for its use.\nGiven these challenges and the lack of opportunity for formal training related to EBPs and IS, strategies are needed to build practice level capacity in service organizations for identifying, adopting, implementing, and sustaining EBPs. To influence professional practice, practitioners and service organizations must know how to (1) choose between competing theories, frameworks, models, and strategies of implementation; (2) must be able to determine which issues are most central to consider for their agency; (3) assess fit for their population; (4) acquire and/or allocated resources; (5) determine which approach(es) have the highest potential to produce successful implementation in their unique service setting; and (6) marshal resources to ensure continuation and continuity of the supports necessary for sustainability.\nThis capacity must address the organization\u2019s ability to adjust and account for changes at systems levels, within Federal and state regulations and licensing and funding requirements; at organizational levels, including considering the organization of programs, the structure of the organization, and its relation to other practitioners; and within the consumer community\u2014by building tolerance, trust, and acknowledging the expectations of consumers (see )."

        "Implementation of EBPs in poor school district settings poses a unique set of challenges. Under-resourced schools often utilize mental health teams comprising both school district and community mental health agency employees ([Markle, Splett, Maras, & Weston, 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4553241/#R53)). The use of multiple providers from different organizational contexts may lead to a fragmented system of care where goals may not be in alignment, and it is unclear who is responsible for presenting problems that traverse both academic and behavioral domains. With the fiscal challenges that poorer school districts face each year, staff is often extremely limited and competing priorities may exacerbate available staff shortage for implementation in these settings (). Support staff and other personnel often are not trained mental health providers, but given staff limitations, they may be responsible for implementation and may not see that as their role or priority ([Benjamin, Taylor, Goodin, & Creed, 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4553241/#R14)).",
        "Many school systems face significant reductions in public funds (; ) that significantly impact the ability to dedicate upfront resources for intervention materials, space, staff training and professional development. Structural and practical issues may be important to consider as well. For instance, shorter school class periods may hinder mental health teams attempts to follow an intervention manual that was initially developed for 60-minute outpatient sessions (e.g., ).\nBarriers to sustainment may arise in the (a) development of principal and other administrator support; (b) alignment of the intervention with school philosophy, goals, policies, and programs; (c) visibility of program outcomes to key stakeholders; and (d) development of support systems for implementers ().",
        "Schools in under-resourced school districts may be the focus of multiple new initiatives that often become fragmented and work at cross-purposes ([Ahram, Stembridge, Fergus, & Noguera, 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4553241/#R4)). This can affect implementation and sustainment of academic and non-academic best practices and contribute to negative attitudes toward the implementation of new initiatives, such as those related to the implementation of mental health EBPs (). This can be especially challenging when competing systems-level stakeholders are present, which may create a climate that is not conducive to long-term initiatives.\nFor example, as previously discussed, in one common school-based mental health approach schools contract with community behavioral health agencies to provide mental health teams to deliver services in the school setting (i.e., co-location; ). This is the approach implemented in most large US cities and in poor rural and suburban school districts. In the co-location approach, it is important to consider that agency leadership may vary in their support of EBP and their level of support often influences the resources and support available to mental health teams being asked to participate in EBP implementation. Community agencies may differ with school administrators on methodology of care, and negotiating these differences can be challenging."

        "Factors operating at the organizational domain (i.e., associated with the entity implementing the task-sharing intervention) were identified primarily as barriers. Studies cited several limited clinical resources as impeding implementation. From the clients\u2019 perspective, understaffed clinics had long waiting times and limited scheduling which reduced engagement, particularly for clients whose socioeconomic situation had constrained their availability to attend appointments. From the providers\u2019 perspective, providers in such clinics needed to manage large caseloads which may potentially lead to burnout or decreased quality of care. Physical space constraints in health clinics also posed a major barrier, such as limiting the ease of achieving privacy for private counseling sessions with users. The absence of these resources constrained effective, sustained client participation by limiting the frequency of appointments or by making clients more reluctant to meaningfully disclose concerns or conditions due to a lack of privacy.\nImplementation climate factors such as collaboration with other entities or healthcare workers on the ground in the delivery of interventions were found to be more successful. For instance, existing networks between providers facilitated referrals from task-sharing workers to specialists and other care providers [], but a relative lack of these types of networks made implementation more difficult []."

        "If outcomes are unsatisfactory and fidelity is low, then the first approach is to improve or modify implementation supports (e.g., more targeted staff recruitment and selection, increased skill-based training, and frequency and type of coaching) in order to improve fidelity (Webster-Stratton, Reinke, Herman, & Newcomer, in press). Or it may be necessary to review the organizational factors (e.g., time allocated for coaching, access to equipment needed for the intervention) and systemic constraints (e.g., licensure requirements that limit recruitment, billing constraints, inappropriate referrals) that may be making it difficult to achieve high fidelity. Making changes to address organizational and/or systems issues (e.g., funding, licensure, billing) often require considerable time and effort. Therefore, the implementation supports of selection, training, and coaching may need to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccompensate' for the organizational and systems barriers (Fixsen et al., 2005). For example, it may take time to address the funding constraints that make it difficult to fund coaching of staff. While attempts to fund the coaching are being pursued, it may be necessary to use more rigorous selection criteria to recruit more experienced staff or provide increased training to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccompensate' for the impact of funding on the provision of coaching.\nIn summary, this table brings home the point that both knowledge and measurement of the presence and strength of the core components (e.g., through fidelity and other measures), are required to interpret and respond to outcome data."

The most expensive failures stem from treating implementation as a one-time technical project rather than an ongoing organizational transformation requiring careful change management and continuous improvement.\n###  Which of the following has been a challenge during the implementation of EHRs?\nMajor challenges during EHR implementation include inadequate needs assessment, budget underestimation, insufficient staff training, poor data migration, workflow disruption, and security compliance issues. Behavioral health organizations particularly struggle with systems that don\u2019t accommodate their specialized documentation requirements and privacy regulations.\n###  What did hospitals do wrong when introducing electronic health records?\nHospitals often underestimated the complexity of by rushing needs assessments, failing to adequately train staff, and not properly optimizing clinical workflows. Many also neglected the critical change management aspects, leading to resistance from clinical staff and implementation of systems that increased rather than decreased documentation burden.",

Many entered the field motivated by direct patient care, not technological proficiency, making comprehensive training absolutely essential for successful adoption.\nImplementation failures frequently stem from:\n  * One-size-fits-all training approaches that don\u2019t address role-specific needs\n  * Insufficient training hours (industry benchmarks suggest 8-12 hours minimum per user)\n  * Training schedules that don\u2019t accommodate clinical workloads\n  * Lack of ongoing support and refresher opportunities after go-live\n  * Failure to address psychological resistance to technology adoption"

Such up-front \nfunding provides recognition for commitments that are embodied in \nbudgetary decisions and maintains governmentwide fiscal control. \nHowever, providing budget authority for the large up-front costs of \ncapital assets creates challenges in an era of resource constraints. \nAgencies have been authorized to use an array of approaches to obtain \ncapital assets without full, up-front budget authority. Our work \nidentified 10 alternative financing approaches used by one or more of \n13 agencies. These approaches, which are described in our letter, \n\n* incremental funding,\n* operating leases,\n* retained fees,\n* real property swaps, \n* sale-leasebacks,\n* lease-leasebacks,\n* public private partnerships,\n* outleases,\n* share-in-savings contracts, and\n* debt issuance.",

From an agency's \nperspective, meeting capital needs through alternative financing \napproaches (i.e., not full funding) can be very attractive because the \nagency can obtain the capital asset without first having to secure \nsufficient appropriations to cover the full cost of the asset. \nDepending on the financing approach, an agency may spread the asset \ncost over a number of years or may never even incur a monetary cost \nthat is recognized in the budget. In other words, alternative financing \napproaches can make it easier for agencies to meet mission capital \ndemands within the constraints of their appropriation. As we have \nreported in the past, however, from a governmentwide perspective the \ncosts associated with these financing approaches may be greater than \nwith full, up-front budget authority.

        "Community coalitions have increasingly been used as a vehicle to foster improvements in community health. A coalition is traditionally defined as \u201ca group of individuals representing diverse organizations, factions or constituencies who agree to work together to achieve a common goal\u201d (Feighery & Rogers, 1990). Community coalitions differ from other types of coalitions in that they include professional and grassroots members that are committed to working together to influence long-term health and welfare practices in their community (Butterfoss, 2007). Additionally, given their ability to leverage existing resources in the community and convene diverse organizations, community coalitions connote a type of collaboration that is considered to be sustainable over time (Butterfoss, Goodman, & Wandersman, 1993).\nFunders of community coalitions include governmental and non-governmental entities. The federal government often provides short-term initial funding to community coalitions to work toward important health goals that cannot be achieved by a single community organization. Foundations also frequently fund community coalitions and other collaborative partnerships to address key social issues. The presumption is that successful community coalitions will be able to identify new resources to continue their activities and to sustain their impacts in the community over time. Understanding the extent to which coalitions can be sustained post-funding will be important as the federal government continues to invest in innovative community-based strategies to improve the health outcomes of Americans.\n###  B. Purpose and Research Questions",
        "In addition, this literature review will serve as the foundation for developing a framework that may be used to assess the sustainability of community coalitions in the future. The conceptual framework will guide the ASPE study, which uses the experiences of the community coalitions funded by the Community Access Program (CAP)/Healthy Communities Access Program (HCAP) to explore sustainability.\nOne of the largest federal investments to strengthen local health care safety nets through community coalitions was the Community Access Program (CAP) and its successor, the Healthy Communities Access Program (HCAP). From 2000 through 2005, HCAP provided grants to local communities to strengthen the health care safety net that serves the uninsured and underinsured. Congressional funding for CAP began with a $25 million appropriation in the fiscal year (FY) 2000 budget that was used to make grants to 23 coalitions of community organizations and safety net providers. Additional funding provided to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for the program included approximately $500 million from FY 2001 through FY 2005. In total, HRSA awarded 260 grants in 45 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Funding for the program was ended in FY 2006.",
        "One of the ways in which CAP/HCAP distinguished itself from other federal safety net programs was by requiring collaboration. Namely, grants were given to consortia of local providers, rather than individual institutions. The program sought to overcome the fragmented nature of safety net care by bringing together the major players of a community and providing funds to address problems that could not be adequately addressed by individual providers or organizations. The CAP/HCAP-funded coalitions focused on activities such as service integration, expansion of the delivery system, cultural competency, provider education, community and patient education, disease detection and prevention, service integration, and new coverage plans for the uninsured, among others. \nUnderstanding the sustainability of community coalitions is particularly important today given new federal investments in clinical and community-based strategies through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. For example, $373 million of ARRA money will fund community consortia to address the leading causes of preventable death and disability under the Communities Putting Prevention to Work initiative. A more complete understanding of the factors that impede and facilitate coalition sustainability will assist successful coalitions to continue this important work after their initial federal funding ends. \nAn extensive review of the literature in the fields of public health and social sciences (particularly sociology, community psychology, and political science) was conducted in order to identify peer-reviewed articles, reports, and white papers. Boolean search techniques were utilized to conduct these searches\u2014maximizing the number of pertinent articles and minimizing extraneous material. References from relevant papers were used to identify additional sources. Exhibit 1.1 briefly summarizes the literature search strategy."

        "Political organizations possess various characteristics, such as composition, resources, objectives, strategies, and activities, which influence their functions and impact within political or governing systems at different scales. For instance, with their formal organizational structures, political parties frequently clash in electoral politics, striving to change or maintain seats of power in government, usually spanning the geography of a country and operating in the macro-political system (or, as referred to it in this article, the macro-system) (). Due to their often outsider status and informal organizational structures, social movements instead typically engage in extra-political activities like civil disobedience and demonstrations. If these activities succeed, they can draw national attention to their cause, impacting the broader macro-system as well ().\nThis article focuses on another informally structured category of political organization, namely advocacy coalitions. These are the backbone of the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), a policy process theory that studies how actors forge alliances to engage in and steer conflicts over policy and administrative issues. A defining characteristic of advocacy coalitions is that they seek to influence policy change and implementation in policy subsystems\u2014i.e., policy-specific subsets of the macro-system ().\nWhile the ACF scholarship continues to evolve and advance, opportunities always exist for further innovations and refinements. In this study, we examine and link two aspects of advocacy coalitions that have so far remained understudied: first, their involvement and mobilization at two levels of collective action (i.e., the macro-system and policy subsystems), and second, the possibility of deep core beliefs acting as the unifying force among members."

        "The cumulative evidence tends to support the propositions of the textbook Advocacy Coalition Theory. For example, empirical evidence has supported the argument for two or more stable coalitions when differences in policy core beliefs might escalate into conflict, but not without nuances and exceptions. In their study of U.S. automotive pollution control over 26 years, Zafonte and Sabatier () analyzed legislative testimonies at congressional hearings to find two advocacy coalitions, one for strict and the other for weak standards. They also observed changes in coalition composition for both coalitions and the emergence of a third coalition (pursuing moderate standards) over time. However, they also found little support for the expectation that policy core beliefs would be more stable than secondary beliefs. For studies of advocacy coalitions over time, Zafonte and Sabatier's findings are not unusual with the identification of stable coalitions with some members leaving, defecting, or joining over an extended period, and mixed results in the relative stability of the ACF's different belief system levels.\nOther studies have explored the mechanisms of coalition stability. For example, studies have examined how the devil shift contributes to coalition stability. Kingiri () used multiple methods (e.g., interviews and documents) to examine the biosafety subsystem in Kenya and found that the devil shift contributed to sustaining an advocacy coalition and limiting learning between coalitions."

        "### 2.2. State-created coalition opportunities\nCoalitions may also be initiated by those within the state who are seeking to advantage low-income marginalized groups. State-led collaborative engagements with civil society are longstanding and substantive (Evans, ; Ostrom, ). Political parties have sought alliances with civil society to strengthen new approaches to longstanding political and governance challenges (Hickey & Sen, ; Houtzager & Moore, ). Turning to city examples, Guti\u00e9rrez et al. () analyse how non-aligned politicians have used these approaches to reduce urban violence in Colombia: \nThe \u2018miracles\u2019 cannot be understood without dealing with urban politics and in particular with the ability of innovative politicians to successfully create viable transformational coalitions within the city. [\u2026] By comparing the differing trajectories of Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn, on the one hand, and Cali, on the other, we can focus on how and why coalitions make a difference. (p. 3136)\nGaventa and McGee () argue that \u2018alliances between social actors and champions of change inside the state are critical to make policy change happen\u2019 (p. 24). But policy changes that favour low-income groups are tricky to secure and hard to maintain. Brazilian policy councils were initiated to provide \u2018institutionalised spaces mediating among civil society organizations, city dwellers and the state\u2019 and councils used the enhanced participatory processes under the 1998 constitution to improve inclusion (Pimentel Walker & Friendly, , p. 436). However, a study in the two cities of S\u00e3o Paulo and Niter\u00f3i highlights that, although the councils have acted very much as multi-stakeholder coalitions (in terms of the definition given above), and have helped to address poverty through regularizing informal neighbourhoods, they have been used by real estate interests to marginalize low-income groups and secure municipal support for private-sector inner-city redevelopment (Pimentel Walker & Friendly, ).",
        "The interest of urban social movements in coalitions appears well founded. Evidence suggests that civil society state coalitions may support reform, making cities more politically inclusive, with more equitable outcomes. Coalitions have the potential to encourage cross-class collaboration (McAdam et al., ; Nelson, ), and improve democratic governance (Gaventa & McGee, ; McAdam et al., ). Coalitions appear to be effective \u2013 at least in part \u2013 because they change elite positions and priorities through deepening their understanding (framing) of disadvantaged groups (McAdam et al., ), resulting in more favourable politics (even if they are seen as oppositional groups) (Iraz\u00e1bal, ; Mouffe, ; Ramirez et al., ; Stone, ).",
        "Coalitional politics is being used by multiple urban social movements \u2013 and agencies that support their work \u2013 to address the scale and nature of disadvantage in towns and cities of the Global South. To advance our understanding about how coalitions might form and function effectively, this paper introduces and analyses four diverse exemplars that illustrate the approaches used. We find that coalitions have the potential to improve the relational capital of disadvantaged residents, increasing the legitimacy of their claims, advancing their interests and leading to pro-poor reforms. Coalitions enhance existing political opportunities and potentially improve the political opportunity structure. However, context matters, particularly the nature and extent of local democracy, and coalitions must operate in a space that is circumscribed and contested.\n\u6539\u9769\u8054\u76df\u5bf9\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8d21\u732e: \u57ce\u5e02\u793e\u4f1a\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u6559\u8bad\u3002. \u591a\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u793e\u4f1a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u90a3\u4e9b\u652f\u6301\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u673a\u6784, \u6b63\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8054\u76df\u653f\u6cbb\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u57ce\u9547\u4e2d\u52a3\u52bf\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u672c\u8d28\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u52a0\u6df1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8054\u76df\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u4f5c\u5730\u7406\u89e3, \u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5e76\u4e14\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u793a\u4f8b, \u4ee5\u8bf4\u660e\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e, \u8054\u76df\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6539\u5584\u5f31\u52bf\u5c45\u6c11\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8d44\u672c, \u589e\u52a0\u5176\u8bc9\u6c42\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u6027, \u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u5229\u76ca, \u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u7a77\u4eba\u7684\u6539\u9769\u3002\u6b64\u5916, \u8054\u76df\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u673a\u4f1a, \u5e76\u5177\u5907\u6539\u5584\u653f\u6cbb\u673a\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c, \u80cc\u666f\u5f88\u91cd\u8981, \u7279\u522b\u662f\u5730\u65b9\u6c11\u4e3b\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6, \u8054\u76df\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002"

        "Political feasibility is at the center of air-pollution policymaking in the developing world, affecting both the choices of policies and their implementation outcomes. Using India as a test case, we demonstrate how political considerations (e.g., public opinion, market structure, and government capacity) can be incorporated into quantitative models for environmental impact assessment. By examining a wide range of clean-air policies across the electricity, industrial, transportation, residential, and agricultural sectors, we find that policies with a great potential to mitigate air pollution can have varying degrees of political feasibility. Because some lower-feasibility policies also co-reduce carbon emissions (e.g., phasing out existing coal units), considering the effects of political feasibility is particularly important in achieving air-pollution and climate objectives simultaneously.",
        "Political-feasibility concerns are at the center of real-world air-pollution policymaking. Yet, these concerns are often not represented in leading decision-support tools that have been used for assessing policies' environmental impacts. Focusing on a wide range of clean-air policies in India, we assess their political-feasibility scores on the basis of public opinion, market, and institutional considerations and then incorporate these scores into the evaluation of environmental impacts by using an integrated assessment model (GAINS-South Asia). We demonstrate that although some policies with substantial potential to mitigate air pollution are also highly politically feasible (e.g., replacing solid fuels with cleaner fuels in households), others can be less politically feasible (e.g., banning agricultural waste burning). Because some clean-air policies co-reduce CO emissions and aerosols, considering varying degrees of political feasibility is particularly important in achieving air-pollution and climate objectives simultaneously because of its implications on the implementation scale and policy sequence."

        "Most earlier studies addressing factors contributing to Medicare costs (mostly defined as government payments) rely on relationships among geographic area means (e.g., ; [Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences 1999](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3165175/#b5); ;). Area-based analyses are particularly prone to bias from unmeasured demand or supply factors likely to confound relationships among area averages (Zuckerman et al. 2010). Moreover, beneficiaries within geographic areas are likely to have heterogeneous characteristics, within-area distributions of variables are likely to vary considerably across areas, and often will not be normally distributed (e.g., health status). As a result, associations among area means and ratios will likely deviate from those that would be estimated at the individual patient level (). Consequently, we estimate determinants of Medicare expenditures (costs) at the beneficiary level.\nAlthough no study can avoid specification bias by including all relevant variables, our study investigates a substantial number of both demand and supply-side variables, many of which were not included in previous work. Finally, we compare factors contributing to the costs of treating two sets of Medicare beneficiaries, based on their expected medical costs. It is important to understand how potential effects differ, because the factors that drive the utilization of high-cost beneficiaries are of greatest policy import.",
        "The 2006 average standardized medical cost for predicted high-cost beneficiaries was nearly U.S.$48,000, compared with about U.S.$7,000 for predicted low-cost patients (). (Median values were U.S.$37,704 and U.S.$3,406, respectively.) Overall, 69 percent of total costs were spent on the 25 percent classified as predicted high-cost beneficiaries. This is lower than the 85 percent typically reported for the 25 percent most costly beneficiaries because of our inability to perfectly predict high and low-cost users, the fact that we are using standardized costs, which truncates some outlier cases, and the exclusion of beneficiaries who received no Medicare services. Medicare payments were a higher percentage of total standardized costs among high-cost beneficiaries (88 versus 82 percent), reflecting greater use of Part A services. For instance, 79 and 84 percent of expenditures on hospitals and postacute care were incurred by predicted high-cost beneficiaries, respectively, compared with about 50 percent of physician service and outpatient costs. Inpatient and postacute care accounted for 63 percent of total costs of predicted high-cost beneficiaries, as compared with 34 percent for predicted low-cost beneficiaries.\nAnnual Standardized Costs and Medicare Payments among Predicted High- and Low-Cost Medicare Beneficiaries  \nMean Costs, Given Any Use | % of Total Costsin Category | Mean Costs, Given Any Use | % of Total Costs in Category | % of Costs Incurred by Predicted High-Cost Beneficiaries  \n\u201cOther\u201d includes clinical lab services, durable medical equipment, Part B drugs, hospice care, psychiatric facility care, and long-term care hospital care.\npresents multivariable results for predicted high-and low-cost beneficiaries. Along with model coefficients, we assess variables' relative importance by reporting elasticities for continuous variables and the coefficient as a percent of mean standardized costs for categorical variables.",
        "The Medicare fee difference variable generated the largest elasticities. Consistent with our hypothesis and previous research, higher relative fees are associated with greater service provision (; ;). The estimated elasticity is larger (0.41) among low-cost beneficiaries than among high-cost beneficiaries (0.23), suggesting physicians may exercise greater discretion in the treatment of healthier beneficiaries.\nAlthough models estimated over the entire sample of low- and high-cost patients explain two-thirds of the variation in beneficiaries' medical costs, several limitations should be noted. First, causal inferences should be made cautiously because the data are cross-sectional. Second, unobserved heterogeneity in the beneficiary population could be correlated with model variables and bias coefficients. Third, available data limit our ability to characterize all key features of local health care markets (e.g., level of care coordination). Fourth, there is no definitive way to define local healthcare markets and our use of counties for most market variables is driven by available data. Finally, the sample is only approximately representative of the elderly, non-ESRD Medicare beneficiaries because it excludes Medicare Advantage enrollees, new enrollees, and beneficiaries because use no physician services over an extended time period, and it uses an indirect sampling method.\nA final limitation is that our study focused only on costs, without considering effects on outcomes (for which claims data are not particularly suited). Though not reported here, we constructed mortality and ambulatory sensitive hospitalization rates (which are analyzed in another study). We did attempt to identify factors that were efficiency enhancing or diminishing by estimating parallel reduced-form models, but the results were ambiguous."

        "To measure this concept, one must measure costs, select appropriate outcome measures, determine whether and how to combine them, and compare state scores. Based on the methods used in the studies reviewed, a three-phased approach is recommended. First, MPR proposes to construct measures of costs per enrollee, stratified by enrollee categories. We also propose to standardize or adjust costs for factors that influence variation in state Medicaid spending that are clearly beyond state Medicaid agency control. Second, MPR would examine quality and access to care measures for which data is available across all or most states to assess whether variation in outcomes and variation in costs appear to be linked. Because the literature provides less guidance for Medicaid quality and other outcome measurement than for expenditure analyses, we will continue to seek input on appropriate outcome measures to be used. Third, MPR will assess alternate ways to rank and compare state performance on cost and outcome measures.\n##  Measuring Medicaid Spending and Costs\nCalculating per enrollee cost measures that support accurate cross-state comparisons requires several technical decisions, including: (1) how to stratify Medicaid enrollees to create reasonably similar comparison groups, (2) whether to examine costs for specific services and if so, how to identify service costs for enrollees in managed care plans, (3) whether to include or exclude costs that cannot be attributed to individual enrollees, such as administrative costs and disproportionate share hospital payments, and (4) how to adjust for factors that are beyond the control of state Medicaid agencies.",
        "Since the proportion of total enrollees in these groups varies by state, we could: (1) examine per enrollee expenditures separately for each of the subgroups, or (2) present only group-level (for example, aged) per enrollee expenditures, but standardize the measures so the proportion of enrollees within each subgroup (for example, aged/dual eligible, aged/not dual eligible) is held constant in assessing overall group level per enrollee expenditures. Because limited-benefit enrollees (for example, adults qualifying only for family planning services) account for a small proportion of Medicaid spending and receive very few services, we do not recommend including them in analyses of per enrollee expenditures.\nService Costs and Medicaid Managed Care. Measures of efficiency often focus on cost per unit of service. In the Medicaid context, this would mean comparing spending per enrollee for discrete service categories, such as hospital inpatient care, prescription drugs, nursing home care, and physician visits. But lower cost per service does not necessarily produce higher value in terms of better quality or other outcomes. In addition, from the purchaser\u2019s perspective, efficiency could result from a different of services provided to enrollees, which argues against analyzing costs at the unit of service level.",
        "For these reasons, we recommend (1) measuring state Medicaid spending for population subgroups for two broad categories of services---acute care and long-term-care---rather than for specific services, and (2) combining fee-for-service (FFS) and managed care populations in each of these two service categories, to the extent that enrollees in managed care organizations (MCOs) can be divided into those receiving primarily acute care versus long-term care services. This higher level of aggregation should produce useful comparisons across states about the efficiency or value obtained through the mix of services provided, and through greater or lesser use of capitated or other forms of managed care compared to fee-for-service payment and delivery models. It is also a practical decision; limitations in the availability of service-specific expenditure data for Medicaid managed care enrollees, whose care is paid on a capitation basis, would restrict detailed comparisons of per-service costs to a small subset of states with little managed care enrollment, or to the long-term care sector where managed care is not as prevalent.\n. Numerous studies and reports highlight large variation in the amount and proportion of total state Medicaid spending on DSH expenditures. However, since DSH payments, and other payments cannot be attributed to individual Medicaid enrollees, and DSH payments cover the cost of care for non-Medicaid, indigent individuals, we do not recommend including these costs in our analysis."

[] presented the first empirical estimate of the marginal cost per unit of health of the NHS in England, followed by similar estimates for Spain [], Australia [], Sweden [], The Netherlands [, ], South Africa [] and China []. The broad rationale for estimating the marginal cost per unit of health produced by the healthcare system in these reviewed studies was to guide health funding decisions. Where the true opportunity cost is unknown, that is, when decisions to fund a new health technology or intervention do not specify what is to be forgone, then an empirical estimate can provide the next best option to quantify the net health impact."

        "To what extent does the research on the long-run effects of the social safety net line up with these predictions? First, there is consistent evidence that social safety net investments during childhood lead to improved adult human capital and economic outcomes as well as health. Aizer (2016) examine an early 20th century cash welfare program and find that additional income in childhood leads to greater educational attainment, income, body weight, and life expectancy. Increased family resources during childhood through the Earned Income Tax Credit have been shown to increase children\u2019s cognitive outcomes (; , ) as well as educational attainment and employment in young adulthood (). While perhaps less mechanistically connected to the increase in resources from these near-cash programs, related work shows that public investments through Head Start preschools and Medicaid also lead to improvements in adult human capital and health. The evidence on the relative importance of exposure is more mixed. show the beneficial effects of Food Stamps on adult metabolic health derive from exposure prior to age five. Aizer (2016) provide suggestive evidence that the positive effects of cash welfare may be larger for children exposed at younger ages. , however, find that larger EITC payments during the teen years, rather than early childhood, drive the increases in educational attainment and earnings in young adulthood.\nAnother mechanism for long-run effects of Food Stamps is a reduction in stress. Recent work shows that lower socio-economic status may be causally related to stress hormones ( cortisol) and that additional resources may attenuate this relationship (; ; ). In turn, and document that in utero exposure to maternal stress has adverse impacts on children\u2019s short- and long-term outcomes."

        "Now that this brief has addressed core characteristics of cash transfer programs, what does the literature say about their effectiveness? This is a challenging question, because cash transfer programs are necessarily context-dependent ([Zhao et al., 2023 [Ch. 2]](https://utorontopress.com/9781487545178/cash-transfers-for-inclusive-societies/); ). Each program unfolds in a specific social context with unique eligibility criteria and disbursements, all of which influence generalizability. Moreover, the specific objectives of a program (e.g., reducing the number of nights spent homeless vs. improving child nutrition) inform its methods (e.g., cash plus housing vouchers vs. cash plus child healthcare access). \nNonetheless, researchers have reported on the general impacts of cash transfers by looking across many programs and summarizing findings using meta-analysis or systematic review. These studies have largely supported the efficacy of conditional and unconditional cash transfers in lifting individuals out of poverty and improving a range of positive outcomes.",
        "Conditional cash transfer programs have mostly been implemented in low- and middle-income countries, targeting families with young children. The short term effectiveness of these programs has been well established, with reviews showing that conditional cash transfers raise savings and investments by around 10-20% of the size of the transfer without reducing labor force participation (), positively influence household consumption by better balancing spending and saving (), and increase the use of preventative health services while improving objective and subjective health (). Regarding young children, conditional cash transfers lower rates of child labor, particularly for boys (), improve school enrollment and attendance (), increase the uptake of maternal and newborn health services (), and generally benefit child health by improving access to care, increasing child and maternal nutrition and immunizations, and reducing morbidity risk and household poverty (). Conditional cash transfers may be more effective in middle-income (vs. low-income) countries, as these countries more often have functional health systems that recipients can use their cash to access (; ).\nSome reviews have tried to estimate the longer-term effects of conditional cash transfers, asking whether these programs break intergenerational cycles of poverty. Evidence for this is considerably more mixed: conditional cash transfers appear to provide some important long-term impacts on schooling, but evidence for other outcomes is limited due to methodological challenges or weak/non-existent long-term impacts ().",
        "In sum, both conditional and unconditional cash transfers appear effective at improving a range of financial, health, and education outcomes. Conditional programs have a longer research history and are mostly conducted in low- and middle-income countries, whereas unconditional programs are relatively newer approaches favored by Western nations like the U.S. and Canada. Although most evidence is on individuals in poverty (rather than individuals experiencing homelessness), recent reviews suggest that programs are most beneficial for the poorest and most vulnerable recipients (Neighly et al., 2022). This suggests that these programs may be highly effective in helping people experiencing homelessness, and two pioneering programs in the U.S. and Canada are now directly testing these questions.\n## What are some examples of direct cash transfer programs targeting people experiencing homelessness?\nAs referenced earlier, , , and the maintain databases of active and past cash transfer programs. Honing in on Community Solutions\u2019 interests, this research brief describes two pilot cash transfer programs aimed at individuals experiencing homelessness, one in and one in the , as well as a related program using \u201cCentralized Diversion Funds\u201d in the .\n### New Leaf Project, Vancouver, B.C."

        "Further research is needed to better understand the characteristics of cash transfer programs that facilitate access to child care and support employment. While traditional economic theory predicts (and have suggested) that unconditional cash transfers will lead to a decline in labor force participation, more recent studies of the employment effects of the \u2014as well as a similar [child benefit program in Canada](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28556/w28556.pdf) that used real-world data and a \u2014found no evidence of a negative labor market response. Meanwhile, the decision to enter the labor force or increase the number of hours worked is complex for parents of young children. A [recent review of the research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9331-3) on child care use and labor force participation among parents of young children suggests that increased access to child care\u2014through reduced out-of-pocket costs or increased availability of public early care and education programs\u2014has positive impacts on maternal labor force participation and work hours; however, the findings also point to considerable variation across different family situations.\nAs this brief has illustrated, the evidence base indicates that cash transfers support infant and toddler development and address an ongoing need for American families with low incomes. Families with low incomes often need additional income support to meet their family\u2019s basic needs; cash transfers do this effectively by allowing families the how to spend their payments to reduce the stressors associated with having a low income and best support their children\u2019s development. To help federal, state, and local policymakers craft new\u2014and strengthen existing\u2014cash transfer initiatives that support infant and toddler development and well-being, we provide four policy recommendations.",
        "Policymakers should implement cash transfer programs as a supplement to existing social safety net programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, and housing subsidies. At present, most cash transfer programs like the EITC and expanded CTC are, alone, not sufficient to meet the full needs of families with infants and toddlers. Instead, they allow families the flexibility to meet needs that are unsupported by other parts of the social safety net. Policymakers should consider cash transfer programs to be one of several important tools in the poverty reduction toolbox and implement them as part of a comprehensive approach to poverty reduction. Furthermore, the impact of poverty reduction strategies such as cash transfers when used in combination with other strategies to lift families out of poverty. In order to effectively combine policy reduction strategies, policymakers should also ensure that, when implementing cash transfer programs, cash transfer benefits families\u2019 eligibility for other benefits.\nThis brief was a team effort.

        "## The Evidence on Cash Transfers\nWhile on the impact of cash transfers continues to build\u2014and there is still much to learn about what benefit amounts are effective, for whom, and in what contexts\u2014there is nonetheless a strong and compelling evidence base, laid out in this section, that cash transfers can effectively support the heathy development and well-being of young children and lay the foundation for improved outcomes throughout children\u2019s lifetimes. Indeed, a of a U.S. child allowance\u2014based on a systematic review of the evidence for the effects of cash transfers on child development and later outcomes\u2014found that a $1,000 increase in family income in one year for a single-parent family with one child generated social benefits five times greater than the initial investment (via reduced health care costs, crime, need for child protection services, etc.).\n### Cash transfers help parents with low incomes meet the essential needs of infants and toddlers.\nParents with low incomes who have infants and toddlers face barriers in meeting their children\u2019s essential needs, such as reliable nutrition and stable housing. The importance of for young children ; however, of all infants and toddlers nationally are growing up with low or very low food security, meaning that their families needed to reduce the quality and/or the quantity of food in their diets due to budgetary restrictions. , for young children is also linked to healthy child development, yet compared to infants and toddlers in families with higher incomes, those in families with low incomes were twice as likely to experience housing insecurity (4% and 2%, respectively) and three times as likely to live in crowded housing ( respectively), likely due to limited availability of ."

In\u2010kind transfers have demonstrable benefits for families (Ellen, ; McKernan, Ratcliffe, & Braga, ; Schwartz, Horn, Ellen, & Cordes, ; Shaefer & Gutierrez, ) and there is growing interest in the United States in combining these forms of assistance with conditional and unconditional cash payments (Gennetian, Shafir, Aber, & De Hoop, ; National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, ).\nCash transfer programs typically take one of three forms in the United States: (1) tax credits for lower\u2010income working families, including the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit; (2) payments to eligible households from industry\u2010related cash distributions, such as payments to Native American households from casino profits or to Alaska state residents from the trans\u2010Alaska oil pipeline and (3) and direct cash payments to low\u2010income and other vulnerable groups through guaranteed income programs.

The first three groups used various research designs and data sources; we describe the methods and scope and highlight key challenges to determining and interpreting causal effects.

TANF is a federal block grant program that gives funding to states to provide cash aid and other support to low-income families with children, with benefits that are time limited and accompanied by work requirements. More than half of TANF cases are child only\u2014that is, benefits are provided solely on the child\u2019s behalf. These cases are typically exempt from work requirements or time limits.\nSNAP offers monthly benefits to help households purchase food. The EITC is a refundable federal tax credit, and many states have supplemental EITCs that may or may not be refundable. These credits are typically accessible to working families with low-to-moderate incomes. The CTC is a tax credit provided to nearly all tax filers with dependent children. A portion of the credit is \u201crefundable,\u201d meaning families with little or no tax liability can still receive cash back from the government. By contrast, GI programs provide unconditional cash payments directly to individuals or families without restrictions on how the money is spent."

        "## How is the Medicaid program financed?\nUnlike Medicare, which is run by the federal government, Medicaid is jointly financed and jointly administered by states, territories, and the federal government. Since the Medicaid program was created in 1965, the federal government has matched state spending on Medicaid services and other costs by contributing a certain percentage of funds. This percentage \u2013 which is called the federal medical assistance percentage, or FMAP \u2013 is calculated using a formula defined by Congress that compares each state\u2019s rolling three-year average per capita income to the United States\u2019 per capita income. This results in states with lower per capita incomes receiving a higher contribution rate and states with higher per capita incomes receiving a lower contribution rate; all states have a maximum FMAP rate of 83 percent and a minimum FMAP rate of 50 percent for this base FMAP.\nMedicaid\u2019s financing structure [can be traced to its roots](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4194918/) in the public assistance system. In 1950, Congress passed a [set of amendments to the Social Security Act](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v13n10/v13n10p3.pdf) to provide states with federal matching funds for certain medical services provided to individuals who were receiving cash assistance. Then, in 1960, the Kerr-Mills Act created the Medical Assistance for the Aged program, which for health care services for certain older adults. When Congress created the Medicaid and Medicare programs through the [Social Security Amendments of 1965](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-79/pdf/STATUTE-79-Pg286.pdf), they retained the federal-state financing structure of the Kerr-Mills Act and adopted the FMAP formula that is still used today.",
        "The federal match rate for most Medicaid-covered services follows this statutorily defined formula. However, , including different FMAP rates for certain populations, providers, and activities. Congress often uses higher \u2013 or \u201cenhanced\u201d \u2013 FMAP rates to states and territories to cover certain services or populations or, alternatively, FMAP reductions to penalize states for not complying with federal requirements. For example, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 [created a time-limited FMAP increase](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/home-community-based-services/guidance-additional-resources/strengthening-and-investing-home-and-community-based-services-for-medicaid-beneficiaries-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-section-9817/index.html) for activities that \u201cenhance, expand, or strengthen\u201d home and community-based services. Congress has also used FMAP enhancements to provide broader fiscal relief to states and territories, including through a .\nImportantly, the five U.S. Territories \u2013 American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands \u2013 have a than the states. The territories\u2019 FMAP rate is set by Congress, instead of using the FMAP formula defined in statute. Historically, the Territories\u2019 FMAP rates were all set at 55%. , Congress permanently increased the FMAP rate to 83% for American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and temporarily increased Puerto Rico\u2019s FMAP to 76%. Additionally, the territories\u2019 federal funding is capped, meaning that once the territories reach their funding allotments each year, they must use entirely local funds to pay for Medicaid-covered services or take steps to manage the lack of additional federal funds, such as reducing the benefits they cover or pausing payments to providers.",
        "How do states and territories fund the \u201cstate share\u201d \u2013 or nonfederal portion \u2013 of Medicaid costs? [According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO)](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-98), in 2018, 68 percent of state share came from state general revenue (which includes state income tax, sales tax, property tax, and fees), while the remaining 32 percent came from local government, taxes on providers, and other sources. As explored below, both federal match and state share play important roles in a state\u2019s budget.\nWhy is Medicaid important to state and territory budgets?\nMedicaid plays a significant role in state and territory budgets. [According to the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO)](https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NASBO/9d2d2db1-c943-4f1b-b750-0fca152d64c2/UploadedImages/SER%20Archive/2024_SER/2024_State_Expenditure_Report_S.pdf), Medicaid was the largest total spending category for states in FY2024, representing about 30 percent of total state expenditures from all sources. However, it is important to note that federal funds \u2013 including federal Medicaid matching funds \u2013 are included in this calculation; when looking only at state general fund expenditures, Medicaid\u2019s footprint shrinks, representing 18.7 percent of general fund expenditures. This is still a substantial share of state resources, coming second only to education, meaning Medicaid plays a central role in state budget processes."

States may receive a higher match rate for certain services and populations.

      "excerpts": [
        "Starting in the 1970s, Congress extended Medicaid coverage to new kinds of beneficiaries by granting states flexibility to provide benefits in nontraditional ways. This was accomplished by permitting CMS to waive various operational requirements on states for providing benefits. These waivers are permitted primarily under two sections of the Social Security Act. Section 1115 authorizes CMS to allow experiments through demonstration programs. These may be used for testing alternative forms of payment, such as managed care and prospective payment for hospitals, and for alternative care arrangements, such as expanded access to home and community-based services (HCBS) for beneficiaries who would otherwise require institutionalization. An estimated six million people benefit from these services. Section 1915 authorizes CMS to permit implementation of changes such as these on an ongoing basis. More comprehensive waivers were authorized by section 1332 the ACA for innovative plans to expand coverage for the overall population.\nHCBS waivers represent a significant part of the Medicaid program, and most are granted under Section 1915(c). The services they cover represent more than half of Medicaid spending on long-term care. Some of them permit access to HCBS for children regardless of family income. Covered services can include assistive technology, behavioral support, communication support, family and caregiver training and support, shift nursing, transportation, and physical, occupational, and speech therapy. HCBS coverage may also be available for children through Medicaid\u2019s Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. Services covered under that program include early detection of conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability and preventive care in addition to medically necessary services.",
        "To fully understand the nature of Medicaid and its variation between states, the obvious structural elements of eligibility and coverage rules tell only part of the story. States can also affect Medicaid\u2019s reach through administrative regulations for obtaining and maintaining enrollment. These rules can create barriers to enrollment with strict requirements that are especially difficult for those with limited financial means to meet. Conversely, they can ease enrollment by permitting more flexibility in compliance. By affecting the size of state Medicaid programs, these rules can shape the implementation of policy goals in a way that largely escapes public notice. A growing body of empirical research has described the nature and extent of their impact.\nCongress has taken two recent steps to limit the impact of administrative requirements as barriers to Medicaid enrollment. The first was enactment of provisions of the Affordable Care Act that directed states to loosen various requirements. The second was provisions of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act that offered states a financial incentive to ease administrative rules and placed a moratorium on disenrollment during the Covid Public Health Emergency. However, restrictive rules returned in many states with the end the Emergency with consequent disenrollment of millions, a poignant demonstration of the importance of administrative requirements as drivers of the size and shape of state Medicaid programs.\nThis Article describes the nature of important administrative requirements that can affect enrollment, reviews empirical evidence of their influence, and proposes three reforms that could dampen the effects of restrictive rules.",
        "This structure has led to considerable variation in Medicaid eligibility between states and between types of beneficiaries. For example, in 2023, the income threshold for parents of dependent children in Alabama was 18% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and 288% of the FPL for children in Minnesota. Variation is even more pronounced in eligibility based on specific conditions.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) reduced the variation in eligibility criteria considerably. It required states to cover all residents whose incomes fell below 133% of the FPL without regard to categories. This meant that adults who are not in families with children could qualify. The federal government pays 90% of the incremental cost. However, participation in the expansion was made voluntary for states by a ruling of the Supreme Court in 2012, so variation remains between the jurisdictions that have accepted it, which currently number forty-one, and those that have not, which currently number ten.\nYet another layer of variation remains beyond the obvious structural elements of eligibility and coverage. To gain and maintain coverage, individuals must comply with numerous administrative requirements that vary across states. Examples include requirements for re-application at regular intervals, for face-to-face interviews as part of the application process, and for asset tests. On first blush, these may appear to be merely technical rules with minimal effect on participation. However, some of them can have a substantial impact that escapes widespread public notice."

              "Published: Jul 30, 2015. Publicly Released: Aug 31, 2015. \nMore than 80 federal programs (including 6 tax expenditures) provide aid to people with low incomes, based on GAO's survey of relevant federal agencies. Medicaid (the largest by far), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) comprised almost two-thirds of fiscal year 2013 federal obligations of $742 billion for these programs. Aid is most often targeted to groups of the low-income population, such as people with disabilities and workers with children. Survey responses showed that criteria used to determine eligibility vary greatly; most common were variants of the federal poverty guidelines, based on the Census Bureau's official poverty measure.\nIn 2013, 48.7 million people (15.5 percent), including many households with children, lived in poverty in the United States, based on Census's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). This measure takes into account certain expenses and federal and state government benefits not included in the official poverty measure. The SPM is not used to determine program eligibility; however, it does provide more information than the official measure on household resources available to meet living expenses. In 2013, the SPM poverty threshold ranged from $21,397 to $25,639 for a family of four, depending on housing situations. Based on six mutually exclusive household types GAO developed, individuals in a household headed by a person with a disability or a single parent had the highest rates of poverty using the SPM, while childless or married parent households had larger numbers of people in poverty using the SPM.",
              "In 2012, the most recent year of data available, GAO estimated that 106 million people, or one-third of the U.S. population, received benefits from at least one or more of eight selected federal low-income programs: Additional Child Tax Credit, EITC, SNAP, SSI, and four others. Almost two-thirds of the eight programs' recipients were in households with children, including many married families. More than 80 percent of recipients also lived in households with some earned income during the year. Without these programs' benefits, GAO estimated that 25 million of these recipients would have been below the SPM poverty threshold. Of the eight programs, EITC and SNAP moved the most people out of poverty, however, the majority of recipients of each of the programs were estimated to have incomes above the SPM threshold, after accounting for receipt of benefits.\nResearch suggests that assistance from selected means-tested low-income programs can encourage people's participation in the labor force, but have mixed effects on the number of hours they work. Changes in certain low-income programs through the years, including the EITC, have enhanced incentives for people to join the labor force, according to studies. While workers who receive means-tested benefits face benefit reductions as their earnings rise, research shows that various factors limit how much people change their work behavior in response. For example, people may not be aware of such changing interactions in a complex tax and benefit system or be able to control the number of hours they work, according to studies. Research also shows that enhancing work incentives can create difficult policy trade-offs, including raising program costs or failing to provide adequate assistance to those in need.\n##  Why GAO Did This Study",
              "The federal government provides assistance aimed at helping people with low-incomes who may earn too little to meet their basic needs, cannot support themselves through work, or who are disadvantaged in other ways. With fiscal pressures facing the federal government and the demands placed on aid programs, GAO was asked to examine federal low-income programs.\nThis report (1) describes federal programs (including tax expenditures) targeted to people with low incomes, (2) identifies the number and selected household characteristics of people in poverty, (3) identifies the number, poverty status, and household characteristics of selected programs' recipients, and (4) examines research on how selected programs may affect incentives to work. For a list of low-income programs that were $100 million in obligations or more in fiscal year 2013, GAO consulted with the Congressional Research Service; surveyed and interviewed officials at relevant federal agencies; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency guidance. GAO also conducted analyses on low-income individuals using Census data on the SPM and official poverty measure and microsimulation data from the Urban Institute that adjusts for under-reporting of benefit receipt in Census survey data. To examine labor force effects, GAO reviewed economic literature. Selected low-income programs were large in dollars and helped meet a range of basic needs.\nGAO is not making new recommendations in this report. GAO clarified portions in response to comments from one agency.\nFor more information, contact Kay Brown at (202) 512-7215 or ."

              "In the half century since President Lyndon B. Johnson declared an unconditional War on Poverty, the Federal Government has invested in strategies that aim to relieve and prevent poverty. Partly as a result of these programs, and a large number of additions and reforms since then, between 1967 and 2012, poverty measured by a measure that accounts for tax and transfer payments 9.8 percentage points, or 38 percent. In 2013, income and nutrition assistance programs lifted 46 million people, including 10 million children, out of the poverty. Medicaid has also resulted in better health care for tens of millions of Americans. Another 16 million people have gained coverage the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage expansions, as of early 2015.\nInnovative economic research is increasingly finding that these programs have long-run benefits for the children in families that receive them. These studies often drawn upon large \u201cadministrative\u201d data sets that are collected in the process of running government programs. These data sources frequently allow researchers to track families over long periods of time with limited attrition, offer much larger sample sizes, and suffer from less missing data than major household surveys. These improvements in data quality have coincided with a \u201c\u201d in economics that has greatly expanded the use of randomized trials and \u201cquasi-experimental\u201d research designs that exploit natural experiments to estimate the causal impact of the programs.\nThe following is a selection of research in this area for five major current programs\u2014early education, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (SNAP), housing vouchers, and Medicaid\u2014plus one historical income support program.\n1.

              "Cash transfers (CTs), for all their evident success in relieving poverty, have been criticised for failing to incorporate transformative elements into their programme design. In recent years changes have been introduced into the design of CT programmes that go some way towards addressing this concern. This article critically engages the meaning of transformative social protection and introduces a collection of papers that examine whether and under what conditions cash transfers can be \u2018transformative\u2019. Among the issues addressed are whether CTs can be catalysts leading to positive changes, material, subjective and relational in the lives of poor people; what are the social effects of CTs for beneficiaries, their households and communities; and can they foster horizontal relationships within communities and vertical relationship with the state through developing forms of social accountability and citizenship engagement?\nWith the eradication of extreme poverty as a priority Millennium Development Goal, cash transfer programmes (CTPs) spread rapidly across the world to reach more than 750 million people in low and middle-income countries in the global south by 2010 (Arnold, Conway, & Greenslade, ). As new programmes multiplied, older ones expanded their coverage to reach significant numbers of targeted populations in the lowest decile. Driving the expansion of CTs was their widely acclaimed record of positive results. Evidence from across the world confirmed that well targeted, well designed social transfer programmes were an effective and affordable instrument for reducing the incidence and intensity of household poverty with measureable improvements in child health and educational attendance (Arnold et al., ; Cecchini & Madariaga, ; Fiszbein et al., ; Soares, Soares, Medeiros, & Guerreiro Os\u00f3rio, ). One commentator, echoing a commonly expressed view, went as far as to state that they were \u2018as close as you can come to a magic bullet in development\u2019.",
              "The articles in the first section of the Special Issue find that CTPs have largely positive outcomes including enhanced self esteem at the individual level, as well as enabling greater participation in social interaction. However in some cases there can be negative side effects of being part of the programme such as feelings of humiliation, stigma and shame due to reliance on the transfer for support. The article by Samuels and Stavropoulou discusses findings from the Transforming Cash Transfers project in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East; that by Attah et al. draws on evaluations of CTPs in east, west and southern Africa, while Adato et al. focus on a South African case study. There is evidence in all three articles of the effects of cash transfer programmes on psychosocial health and behaviour. Both Attah et al. and Samuels and Stavropoulou look at how psychosocial wellbeing affects both individuals and their relation to others. Attah et al. present findings from a mixed method evaluation of a cash transfer in Kenya, and from cross-country qualitative research from Ghana, Zimbabwe and Lesotho. They pay particular attention to the intrinsic and instrumental dimensions of psychosocial wellbeing showing that cash transfers can have positive impacts on psychosocial wellbeing leading to further positive impacts on educational performance, participation in social life and empowerment for decision-making."

              "Research has shown that poverty experienced during early childhood is associated with worse child, youth, and adult outcomes. Aspects of development affected by poverty early in life include learning, educational attainment, physical and mental health, and adult earnings. The negative effects of poverty may be particularly strong when it is experienced during early childhood, relative to later in childhood and in adolescence. Developmental theory suggests that family processes play an important role in explaining associations between income poverty and children\u2019s outcomes. However, the extent to which income support and anti-poverty initiatives causally affect family processes among families with low incomes is not well understood.\nMany longitudinal, non-experimental studies have established the cascading effects of economic hardship and low income, which contribute to parental psychological distress and reduce the quality of family relationships, parenting, and child outcomes. The goal of this randomized controlled study is to examine the extent to which a multi-year cash transfer program\u2014which provides an ~$4000 annual unconditional cash transfer, distributed monthly as a cash gift on a debit card to participants who had given birth (henceforth, mothers) and had prior-year household income below the federal poverty threshold\u2014affects economic hardship, maternal well-being, family relationships, and parenting across the first three years of life.",

Experimental evaluations of these programs typically include some measures of economic well-being as well as physical and mental health, but few include measures of family processes. Systematic reviews of these international studies find that, on average, cash transfer programs improve food security and indicators of economic well-being as well as mental health. A recent meta-analysis of 45 conditional and unconditional cash transfer evaluations conducted in low- and middle-income countries found average effect sizes of +0.13 on adult subjective well-being and \u22120.07 on mental health problems (primarily depressive symptoms). In addition, most cash transfer programs either reduce intimate partner violence or do not affect it at all. Baranov et al.\u2019s meta-analysis found that cash transfer programs reduce intimate partner violence by 2\u20134% depending on the type of violence measured.",
              "However, systematic reviews suggest considerable heterogeneity in the estimated impacts of cash transfer programs on parent and child well-being, both across and within studies. McGuire et al.\u2019s meta-analysis found that unconditional cash transfers had larger impacts than conditional ones, and that impacts declined over time after the payments ended. Yet not all results are consistent\u2014an evaluation of a unconditional cash transfer program in Ecuador found that monthly cash transfers amounting to 10% of household income improved young children\u2019s development among families with the lowest incomes, but generated null to negative effects on maternal mental health among those same families. The same cash transfer in Ecuador reduced emotional violence in households for mothers with higher educational attainment, but not for mothers with lower educational attainment. Among mothers with lower educational attainment, if the mother\u2019s educational attainment was higher than her partner\u2019s, the cash transfer appeared to increase emotional violence."

              "#  Improving Lives Through Cash Transfers \nA cash transfer is a payment of money to a recipient, either as a one-time or a repeat payment. In humanitarian contexts, cash transfers are often used to alleviate poverty and provide assistance in emergencies and in economic development. Evidence demonstrates that cash transfer programs, growing around the globe since the mid-1990s, are a cost-effective way to improve the lives of poor households across many domains.\nThese programs can impact a wide range of development outcomes because recipients purchase food, invest in agriculture, improve their shelter, and pay for medical and education expenses. Cash transfers address poor households\u2019 severe budget constraints and investment needs ranging across education, health, household, and business.\n_Read about our work in:_\nCash transfer programs come in many designs that vary by conditionality, targeted population, size of grant, frequency of grant, and length of the program. They are one of the most studied development programs today with much evidence demonstrating their success, yet there remain questions about how variations in programs can affect their impact. Does adding resources or services to the cash transfers maximize their benefits? How can they be adapted for use in refugee camps or with migrant populations? \nAIR\u2019s extensive expertise in evaluating cash transfers provides a unique ability to assess commonalities and differences across cash transfer programs. AIR took this opportunity to synthesize findings across studies to identify lessons for designing cash transfer programming.\nWhile impact evaluations are an essential component for creating a rigorous evidence base on the effectiveness of cash transfer programs, mixed-methods evaluations of program design and implementation fidelity are critical to understand how cash transfer programs work.",
              "This program aims to reduce child poverty, improve child well-being, and promote access to basic services for families. It has three components: a regular cash transfer, distributed to the primary caregiver of children ages 0-2; a social behavior change communication package around positive nutrition and hygiene practices; and family support services for the most vulnerable program participants. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) Mozambique hired AIR and its partners to conduct a 24-month, longitudinal impact evaluation and process evaluation of this program\u2019s start-up phase.\nBased on the evidence that AIR generated, the Government of Mozambique decided to expand the \"cash and care\" model, aiming to reach 500,000 children for the period from 2022 to 2026 in 10 provinces. The expansion plan aims to cover approximately 20 percent of the children aged 0-2. \nAlthough the number of refugee children enrolled in school in Turkey has increased significantly in recent years, a number of obstacles mean nearly 40 percent of Syrian children living in Turkey remain out of school. UNICEF Turkey contracted with AIR to conduct a rigorous program evaluation of the Conditional Cash Transfer for Education for Syrians and Other Refugees, which provides bimonthly cash payments to eligible households and targeted support in the form of child protection outreach visits to households with children deemed to be most at risk. \nThe relationship between happiness and income is at the center of a vibrant debate, as emotional states are an important determinant of health and social behavior. This journal article discusses whether a government-run unconditional cash transfer paid directly to women in poor households had an impact on self-reported happiness.\n### Cash Transfers Explained: How Cash Empowers Poor Families in Zambia (Video)"

              "Cash transfer programs have emerged as potent tools for alleviating poverty and enhancing the living conditions of the most deprived households in developing nations. Such initiatives have now become integral components of social protection systems in many developing countries, including Pakistan. Evaluating the efficacy of these safety nets is crucial to comprehend their value in terms of public expenditure. This research employed a well-being index to gauge the impact of unconditional cash transfers on the socioeconomics of recipients. By employing three rounds of the BISP impact assessment survey conducted in 2011, 2016, and 2019. The study measured the overall impact of cash transfers on well-being by utilizing Principal Component Analysis in conjunction with a Difference-in-Differences Quasi-Experimental design over the years. The findings of the study indicate that between 2011 and 2016, the socioeconomic status declined for both treatment and control groups, but the reduction was less pronounced among those who received treatment compared to the control group with insignificant. From 2016 to 2019, there was a marginal positive increase in socioeconomic status, although it was of insignificance. Overall, the well-being of both the control and treatment groups decreased from 2011 to 2019, with a slightly more pronounced improvement observed in the treatment group. This trend suggests that the impact of the BISP unconditional cash transfer program had a limited effect on altering the well-being of the beneficiaries. The lack of substantial impact from the BISP\u2019s cash transfers on household well-being can be attributed to factors such as inflation, unemployment, economic slowdown, payment challenges, insufficient funding, and gaps between installments. The government of Pakistan should reconsider the substantial investment in BISP within the context of value for money",
              "### Similar content being viewed by others\nCash transfers have emerged as a powerful tool in reducing poverty and improving the wellbeing of the poorest households in developing countries (Baird et al. ). These transfers provide direct monetary assistance to low-income families with the primary objective of improving their income and increasing their consumption of essential commodities (Handa and Davis ). According to recent estimates, cash transfers have already benefitted approximately 718 million people in developing countries, with the numbers expected to rise in the coming years (De Groot et al. ).\nIn the short term, these transfers can provide resources that families can use to meet immediate needs like food and shelter, while in the long term, they can enable families to invest in education, health, and other productive activities to break out of the poverty cycle (Ayoo ). Cash transfers can also empower women, improve school attendance, and contribute to better nutrition and health outcomes, particularly in patriarchal societies where women have limited access to resources and decision-making (Sugiyama and Hunter ).\nCash transfer schemes are now an integral part of the social protection systems of many developing countries due to poverty and social well-being being significant obstacles to sustainable development. Education, health, and women\u2019s empowerment are particularly critical areas that need to be addressed (De Groot et al. ). Despite progress made over the past few decades, the challenges remain substantial. For instance, although more than one billion individuals were lifted out of extreme poverty between 1990 and 2011, 258 million children and youth worldwide are still out of school. Moreover, 828 million people in 2021 do not have sufficient food to eat (UNICEF ; WFP and UNICEF ).",
              "Additionally, this research investigates the differential impact of socioeconomic and cash transfers on household and beneficiaries\u2019 characteristics. The findings of this research are crucial for informing evidence-based policy analysis to scale up contributions to cash transfer programs. This is particularly relevant in the context of national government commitments to improving value for money, expanding coverage, ensuring financial sustainability, clarifying the level and type of impact, and adequately reflecting these in social wellbeing. Moreover, this research aims to take a strategic approach to providing technical assistance on national cash transfer systems, in line with the government\u2019s commitment to reducing poverty, improving health, education, and empowering women.\nIn the world, across 72 to 149 Social Safety Nets (SSN)/Social Assistance (SA) programs have been launched in various developing and developed nations to alleviate poverty, increase well-being, social development, and safeguard against economic shocks (Saleem and World Bank ). In developing nations, tailored interventions have long been used to reduce poverty and promote social well-being. Ivaschenko et al. () investigate trends in SSN programme coverage, spending, and programme performance throughout the world and find evidence of an increasing commitment to SSN/SA programmes, emphasizing their substantial contribution to poverty reduction efforts. However, they also stress the continuous difficulty of low programme coverage and benefits, implying that while these programmes have made achievements, more effort is needed to achieve meaningful poverty reduction."

              "The social safety net\u2019s disjointedness and complexity require needy families to interact multiple times with government agencies to access benefits. Some complexity is necessary to ensure only eligible families receive assistance. However, the myriad possible program and service combinations create a bureaucratic web that government officials and benefit recipients must navigate.\nThe largest share of safety-net spending goes to means-tested health insurance programs, including Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. According to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, total Medicaid spending in fiscal year (FY) 2020 topped $649 billion, of which the federal government supported 67 percent, and the program covered approximately 76 million individuals. Medicaid overshadows other safety-net spending and deserves its own reforms (covered in Chapter 5 of this volume).\nThe remaining major means-tested safety-net programs (including refundable credits paid under the EITC and CTC) cost taxpayers over $300 billion annually in just federal outlays, as Table 1 illustrates. Excluding health care, the largest programs in terms of recipients and dollars cover four areas: income support, food and nutrition assistance, childcare, and housing and energy assistance. Table 1 briefly describes major programs and their 2019 costs before significant increases related to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTable 1. Description and Recent Federal Cost of Major Means-Tested Safety-Net Programs\nEarned Income Tax Credit (EITC) | \n  * The EITC provides at tax time a lump-sum benefit of up to about $6,700, depending on household income and family size, including to those without federal income tax liability. \n  * The EITC phases in at different rates depending on family size, starting with the first dollar earned and increasing as earnings rise.",
              "| Program expenditures were $32.0 billion.   \nHousing (Housing Choice Vouchers and Public Housing)  | \n  * Programs provide two types of assistance: tenant-based assistance such as vouchers to eligible families used for housing costs and project-based assistance such as apartments in public housing.\n  * Programs are administered by state housing authorities.\n  * Voucher amounts vary by state and follow fair market rent guidelines. Public housing assigns apartments to eligible recipients. Both programs generally require families to contribute 30 percent of income toward housing costs.\n  * Funding is limited, and not all eligible families receive assistance.\n\n| Program expenditures were $29.9 billion.   \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)  | \n  * LIHEAP assists low-income families with heating and electricity costs.\n  * It is administered by the states.\n  * Income eligibility varies by state, but household income must be below 150 percent of the federal poverty threshold, with categorical eligibility provided through TANF, SNAP, and SSI.\n  * Benefit amounts vary widely by state. \n\n| Program expenditures were $3.6 billion.   \nChild Care and Development Fund, which includes funding through the Child Care and Development Block Grant, also known as the Child Care Subsidy Program | \n  * The fund provides vouchers to eligible low- and moderate-income families to cover childcare costs, with some assistance through direct childcare \u201cslots.\u201d\n  * States generally pay childcare providers directly.

              "For medical services used by most Medicaid enrollees\u2014those who were not made eligible by the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\u2014the share of Medicaid costs paid by the federal government is specified by the federal medical assistance percentage rate (FMAP rate). The FMAP rate is determined by a formula that provides a higher rate of federal reimbursement for states with lower per capita income relative to the national average and a lower rate for higher-income states. By law, a state's FMAP rate can be no less than 50 percent and no more than 83 percent. The national average matching rate over the 2024\u20132032 period for services provided to those enrollees is projected to be 60 percent, with states contributing the remaining 40 percent. In 2021, federal spending governed by the FMAP formula was $397 billion, or about 75 percent of total federal Medicaid spending. Federal spending for states with FMAP rates set at the 50 percent floor accounted for 38 percent of that amount.",
              "The federal government's share of costs for medical services is considerably larger for enrollees who became eligible for Medicaid because of the optional expansion of eligibility under the ACA. That law allowed states to expand eligibility to all adults under age 65 (including parents and adults without dependent children) who have income below 138 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. (Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have adopted the expansion.) For those who are eligible as a result, the federal government's share of Medicaid costs is fixed at 90 percent and does not vary by state. That higher matching rate was made available\u2014even though those enrollees' health risks are typically lower than the health risks of some other eligible groups, such as the elderly and disabled\u2014in order to lower the financial cost to states of covering a group that had not generally been covered previously. In 2021, federal spending for services provided to those newly eligible enrollees was $99 billion, or about 20 percent of total federal Medicaid spending.",
              "The federal government's share of administrative expenses is also specified by statute and varies by the category of such costs, but not by state. The federal government's share of general administrative expenses is 50 percent; however, for 25 specified categories of administrative costs, the federal share ranges from about 70 percent to 100 percent. For example, the federal government pays 75 percent of the cost of employing skilled medical professionals for Medicaid administration, 75 percent of the cost of utilization review (the process of determining the appropriateness and medical necessity of various health care services), 90 percent of the cost of developing systems to manage claims and information, and 100 percent of the cost of prescription-drug monitoring programs. The overall average federal share for administrative expenses was 62 percent in 2021. That year, federal spending for Medicaid administration was $20 billion, or about 5 percent of total federal Medicaid spending.\nThis option consists of three alternatives, each of which would go into effect in October 2023.\n  * Under the first alternative, the federal government's share for all categories of administrative spending would be 50 percent.\n  * Under the second alternative, the 50 percent floor on the FMAP rate that applies to medical services for enrollees not made eligible by the ACA would be removed. Consequently, FMAP rates would fall below 50 percent for states with the highest per capita income. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this alternative would affect 13 states, and the new matching rates for those states would be between 4 percent and 49.75 percent.\n  * Under the third alternative, the federal share of medical expenditures for enrollees made eligible by the ACA would be based on the same FMAP formula that applies to all other enrollees."

              "# Eliminating the Medicaid Expansion Federal Match Rate: State-by-State Estimates\nThere are under consideration in Congress to significantly to help pay for an extension of expiring tax cuts. Medicaid is the primary program providing comprehensive health and long-term care to people living in the U.S. and accounts for nearly [$1 out of every $5](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-the-basics/) spent on health care. Medicaid is administered by states within broad federal rules and jointly funded by states and the federal government, meaning restrictions in federal Medicaid spending could leave states with about how to offset reductions. This analysis examines the potential impacts on states and Medicaid enrollees of one prominent proposal, which would eliminate the 90% federal match rate for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion, which currently covers over 20 million people. Key takeaways include:\n  * This analysis explores the impact of eliminating the ACA expansion match rate under two scenarios. The first assumes that states maintain Medicaid expansion coverage and pick up new expansion costs, resulting in a decrease of 10% (or $626 billion) in federal Medicaid spending and an increase of 17% (or $626 billion) in state Medicaid spending across all states over a 10-year period.\n  * The second scenario assumes that states drop the ACA Medicaid expansion in response to the elimination of the 90% federal match rate. This would result in a 25% (or $1.7 trillion) decrease in federal Medicaid spending and a 5% (or $186 billion) decrease in state Medicaid spending across all states over a 10-year period. This would also cut total Medicaid spending by nearly one-fifth (or $1.9 trillion), and nearly a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees (20 million people) would lose coverage.\n  * Only states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion would see any spending or enrollment impacts under this policy proposal, though changes vary by state.",
              "## What is the proposed policy change?\nStates that have implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion currently receive a 90%[federal match rate or \u201cFMAP\u201d](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-the-basics/)for adults covered through the expansion, meaning the federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion enrollees. The ACA expanded Medicaid coverage to nearly all adults with incomes up to 138% of the ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). However, a effectively made the decision to implement the Medicaid expansion an option for states. (including DC) have since adopted Medicaid expansion, and Medicaid expansion enrollees nearly a quarter of Medicaid enrollment (as of March 2024) and one-fifth of total Medicaid spending (as of FY 2023). The FMAP for services used by people eligible through traditional Medicaid is determined by a formula set in statute. The formula is designed so that the federal government provides a match rate of at least 50% and provides a higher match rate for states with lower average per capita income. For FY 2026, the traditional from 50% to 77%.\nThis analysis estimates the impact of eliminating the enhanced FMAP for adults in the Medicaid expansion. The analysis assumes that, starting in FY 2026, expenditures for people eligible in the Medicaid expansion would be matched at each state\u2019s traditional 2026 FMAP rate. Details regarding the design of this policy change have yet to be released, and the details of proposed legislation may differ from the assumptions made to complete this analysis. This is also only one of the various Medicaid policy changes that have been suggested and estimates would change if multiple policies were considered together.\n## What are the potential impacts on Medicaid spending and enrollment?",
              "This analysis does not make assumptions about specific state behavioral responses and instead examines the impact of eliminating the ACA expansion match rate under two scenarios. These scenarios are designed to illustrate the range of potential policy change effects; in practice, each state may respond to the policy change differently. While some states may choose to continue ACA Medicaid expansion coverage with substantially reduced federal funding, many likely would not given the extra spending that would be required. The analysis also excludes secondary effects such as people who lose coverage through the Medicaid expansion enrolling in Medicaid under other eligibility pathways or enrolling in private health coverage. The estimates presented here are not directly comparable to the from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) because CBO\u2019s estimates account for assumptions about state behavioral responses and other secondary effects.\n  * All expansion states pick up new expansion costs. Expansion enrollment and total spending would remain constant while costs shift from the federal government to the states.\n  * All states drop the ACA Medicaid expansion, resulting in changes to enrollment as well as total, federal, and state spending."

              "How does Medicaid expansion generate savings to offset such costs? Medicaid expansion allows states to access an enhanced federal match for some people who would otherwise be covered by traditional Medicaid (). Given that states pay between 25 percent and 50 percent of the cost for a traditional Medicaid beneficiary but only 10 percent of the cost for an expansion beneficiary, these savings can be substantial. States can save from 15 cents to 40 cents on every dollar of care it can shift to expansion (assuming 2020 expansion match rates).\nPrior research identifies several types of expansion beneficiaries who would likely receive traditional Medicaid in the absence of expansion. Some are people who would have been covered through specific Medicaid programs, such as Section 1115 waivers or the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program. Some are people who used to spend down assets or pursue a disability designation to qualify for Medicaid that now qualify for expansion. The populations affected vary from state to state, depending on the specifics of their traditional Medicaid programs.\nWhile researchers have a clear understanding of how expansion may reduce states\u2019 traditional Medicaid spending, calculating the magnitude of these savings is difficult. In expansion states, we only observe what happened with expansion \u2014 not what these states would have spent had they not expanded Medicaid."

              "Under the \u2019s 90 percent federal reimbursement percentage, $100 of financing gimmicks yields $900 in federal funds for the state. Under the average state\u2019s 60 percent federal reimbursement for traditional Medicaid recipients, $100 of financing gimmicks yields $150 in federal funds for the state. Money laundering for spending on the expansion population thus has a rate of return six times higher for the average state\u2014and more so for wealthier states that receive lower federal reimbursements for traditional recipients.\nThe federal government\u2019s near-total subsidization of the expansion group dramatically weakens states\u2019 incentives to enforce eligibility rules. When ineligible individuals receive benefits through the expansion group, states bear almost none of the cost. On the other hand, ineligible enrollment in Medicaid allows governors and state legislators to boast of reducing the uninsured rate, expanding health coverage for their constituents, and supporting local hospitals and insurers offering Medicaid plans. In essence, state policymakers reap the political benefits of allowing large numbers of ineligible enrollees in Medicaid while federal taxpayers foot the bill.\nDifferences in federal matching rates also create strong financial motives for states to classify individuals eligible for Medicaid under traditional pathways as expansion enrollees. For example, if the annual cost for a Medicaid enrollee is $10,000, states save $3,000 per year by placing them in the expansion group with a 90 percent federal match, compared to the 60 percent match for the traditional group. Research suggests that these types of reclassifications may be widespread, affecting millions of enrollees and substantially inflating federal spending on ."

              "As the foregoing suggests, strong matching requirements are the exception rather than the rule in federal grant programs. In fact, strong matching requirements present a tradeoff to federal policy-making officials. Many grants have the objective of providing a minimum floor of services across the nation and across all states or localities. From this perspective, strong matching requirements\u2014although prompting greater deliberation and oversight by state and local officials\u2014may also serve to discourage participation by these governments, thereby frustrating the provision of uniform minimum services throughout the country. The impacts of matching on grant participation can be particularly severe for fiscally hard-pressed entities for whom raising the nonfederal share constitutes a greater burden than for wealthier jurisdictions. Federal policy makers can adjust matching rates to reflect the differential fiscal capacity across the nation by varying the matching formula or by waiving matching for certain governments. Indeed, the federal Medicaid program allocates federal funds through a matching formula that provides a higher federal share to states with lower per capita incomes, as a proxy for fiscal capacity. However, for most programs, the matching rate is either lowered or eliminated, recognizing the importance that federal policy makers place on ensuring maximum participation in grant programs."

It will also provide recommendations for future research efforts, to be informed by key stakeholders, aimed at developing implementation practice capacity to improve the implementation of EBPs and client outcomes.\n##  Issues for Consideration in Implementation Practice\n### Challenges to implementation of evidence-based practices\nAlthough the promotion of EBPs in health services represented a critical advancement in behavioral health care, the well-intentioned push towards the use of EBPs often fails to close the gap between the best available research and practice. EBPs must be effectively matched to community needs, implemented with fidelity to the standards of the intervention, and integrated within regular practices, so they may be sustained over time to ensure better outcomes for consumers. An organization adopting an EBP without first considering implementation and its associated barriers may not be able to ensure effective outcomes among clients. To achieve positive outcomes, EBPs must not simply be implemented but implemented with quality. However, behavioral health organizations and practitioners face significant challenges to successful implementation. These include the following: (1) being able to access and understand research findings and interpret them for the needs of their clients, agency, and community; (2) being able to identify and select EBPs they can afford; (3) being able to do the actual work of implementing the EBP through staff training, instituting new policies, and negotiating new contracts; and (4) integrating these changes so these efforts can be sustained.",
              "Practitioners may also have difficulties in matching EBPs that are often developed with very narrow and specific populations, with their more diverse clientele. Those they serve may suffer from multiple, complex issues bridging mental and physical health concerns, historic disparities and discrimination, poverty, mobility, and education. A topic that has caused tension in the research community is the discussion of fidelity and adaption. While many argue that adaptations are necessary to meet the needs of a specific setting, others postulate that an EBP that has been adapted may compromise the core elements of the program and be less effective when compared to the original program. Although fidelity has become the \u201cgold standard\u201d for successful program implementation, it may not take into consideration how a program fits within a context. In addition, organizational characteristics such as readiness for change, climate, staffing, leadership, and funding can significantly impact the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of EBPs. Sustainability may require long-term commitments to facilitate change, including the support of new policies, procedures, and infrastructure enhancements. Supporting implementation and sustainability may require new partnerships and collaborations, sufficient funding, and ongoing problem-solving. illustrates the core challenges of translating implementation science into implementation practice.\nCore Challenges of Translating Implementation Science into Implementation Practice",
              "A significant amount of IS research is often conducted with limited collaboration or input from key stakeholders (i.e., clients, practitioners, and service organizations). This may result in an implementation strategy that does not take real-world barriers into consideration, that may be used incorrectly, and/or that is unable to be replicated. In order to develop tangible, applicable, and sustainable strategies for capacity building among practitioners and service organizations in implementation practice, it is essential that the strategies are created and tested in collaboration with the key stakeholders intended for its use.\nGiven these challenges and the lack of opportunity for formal training related to EBPs and IS, strategies are needed to build practice level capacity in service organizations for identifying, adopting, implementing, and sustaining EBPs. To influence professional practice, practitioners and service organizations must know how to (1) choose between competing theories, frameworks, models, and strategies of implementation; (2) must be able to determine which issues are most central to consider for their agency; (3) assess fit for their population; (4) acquire and/or allocated resources; (5) determine which approach(es) have the highest potential to produce successful implementation in their unique service setting; and (6) marshal resources to ensure continuation and continuity of the supports necessary for sustainability.\nThis capacity must address the organization\u2019s ability to adjust and account for changes at systems levels, within Federal and state regulations and licensing and funding requirements; at organizational levels, including considering the organization of programs, the structure of the organization, and its relation to other practitioners; and within the consumer community\u2014by building tolerance, trust, and acknowledging the expectations of consumers (see )."

              "Implementation of EBPs in poor school district settings poses a unique set of challenges. Under-resourced schools often utilize mental health teams comprising both school district and community mental health agency employees ([Markle, Splett, Maras, & Weston, 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4553241/#R53)). The use of multiple providers from different organizational contexts may lead to a fragmented system of care where goals may not be in alignment, and it is unclear who is responsible for presenting problems that traverse both academic and behavioral domains. With the fiscal challenges that poorer school districts face each year, staff is often extremely limited and competing priorities may exacerbate available staff shortage for implementation in these settings (). Support staff and other personnel often are not trained mental health providers, but given staff limitations, they may be responsible for implementation and may not see that as their role or priority ([Benjamin, Taylor, Goodin, & Creed, 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4553241/#R14)).",
              "Many school systems face significant reductions in public funds (; ) that significantly impact the ability to dedicate upfront resources for intervention materials, space, staff training and professional development. Structural and practical issues may be important to consider as well. For instance, shorter school class periods may hinder mental health teams attempts to follow an intervention manual that was initially developed for 60-minute outpatient sessions (e.g., ).\nBarriers to sustainment may arise in the (a) development of principal and other administrator support; (b) alignment of the intervention with school philosophy, goals, policies, and programs; (c) visibility of program outcomes to key stakeholders; and (d) development of support systems for implementers ().",
              "Schools in under-resourced school districts may be the focus of multiple new initiatives that often become fragmented and work at cross-purposes ([Ahram, Stembridge, Fergus, & Noguera, 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4553241/#R4)). This can affect implementation and sustainment of academic and non-academic best practices and contribute to negative attitudes toward the implementation of new initiatives, such as those related to the implementation of mental health EBPs (). This can be especially challenging when competing systems-level stakeholders are present, which may create a climate that is not conducive to long-term initiatives.\nFor example, as previously discussed, in one common school-based mental health approach schools contract with community behavioral health agencies to provide mental health teams to deliver services in the school setting (i.e., co-location; ). This is the approach implemented in most large US cities and in poor rural and suburban school districts. In the co-location approach, it is important to consider that agency leadership may vary in their support of EBP and their level of support often influences the resources and support available to mental health teams being asked to participate in EBP implementation. Community agencies may differ with school administrators on methodology of care, and negotiating these differences can be challenging."

Studies cited several limited clinical resources as impeding implementation. From the clients\u2019 perspective, understaffed clinics had long waiting times and limited scheduling which reduced engagement, particularly for clients whose socioeconomic situation had constrained their availability to attend appointments. From the providers\u2019 perspective, providers in such clinics needed to manage large caseloads which may potentially lead to burnout or decreased quality of care. Physical space constraints in health clinics also posed a major barrier, such as limiting the ease of achieving privacy for private counseling sessions with users. The absence of these resources constrained effective, sustained client participation by limiting the frequency of appointments or by making clients more reluctant to meaningfully disclose concerns or conditions due to a lack of privacy.\nImplementation climate factors such as collaboration with other entities or healthcare workers on the ground in the delivery of interventions were found to be more successful. For instance, existing networks between providers facilitated referrals from task-sharing workers to specialists and other care providers [], but a relative lack of these types of networks made implementation more difficult []."

Or it may be necessary to review the organizational factors (e.g., time allocated for coaching, access to equipment needed for the intervention) and systemic constraints (e.g., licensure requirements that limit recruitment, billing constraints, inappropriate referrals) that may be making it difficult to achieve high fidelity. Making changes to address organizational and/or systems issues (e.g., funding, licensure, billing) often require considerable time and effort. Therefore, the implementation supports of selection, training, and coaching may need to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccompensate' for the organizational and systems barriers (Fixsen et al., 2005). For example, it may take time to address the funding constraints that make it difficult to fund coaching of staff. While attempts to fund the coaching are being pursued, it may be necessary to use more rigorous selection criteria to recruit more experienced staff or provide increased training to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccompensate' for the impact of funding on the provision of coaching.\nIn summary, this table brings home the point that both knowledge and measurement of the presence and strength of the core components (e.g., through fidelity and other measures), are required to interpret and respond to outcome data."

Some of the largest of these tax breaks largely benefit highly profitable corporations and wealthy individuals and make the state\u2019s tax system less equitable.\nThe governor\u2019s proposal includes the following tax policy proposals:"

A minor party candidate is the nominee of a party whose candidate received between five and 25 percent of the total popular vote in the preceding presidential election. The amount of public funding to which a minor party candidate is entitled is based on the ratio of the party's popular vote in the preceding presidential election to the average popular vote of the two major party candidates in that election. A new party candidate receives partial public funding after the election if he or she receives five percent or more of the vote. The entitlement is based on the ratio of the new party candidate's popular vote in the current election to the average popular vote of the two major party candidates in the election.\nOnce the FEC determines that a candidate has met the eligibility requirements, it certifies the amount of public funds to which the candidate is entitled.

              "The U.S. campaign finance system unfairly favors a small handful of wealthy donors. Small donor public financing could fix that.\nThere is a growing disconnect between elected officials and the majority of people they represent. Part of the blame lies with a campaign finance system that unfairly stacks the deck in favor of the few donors able to give large contributions. d and other court rulings ended decades of commonsense campaign finance laws. Now a handful of wealthy special interests dominate political funding, often through super PACs and shadowy nonprofits that shield donors\u2019 identities.\nBrennan Center for Justice has pioneered the most effective and promising solution to the problem of big money in politics: small donor public financing, a system in which public funds [match and multiply small donations](https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/small-donor-public-financing-ny). New York City\u2019s multiple match system, in which a $50 donation generates a total of $350 for the candidate, has helped reduce the influence of special interests and empower average voters, and the idea is gaining traction across the country. \nIt\u2019s easy to see why. Small donor public financing incentivizes candidates to seek out many supporters, not just a few big donors. It enables more candidates from diverse backgrounds to run and it amplifies the voices of regular people. Designed right, small donor public financing also permits candidates to raise and spend what they need to compete in the super PAC era, should they choose to opt in. And, because it doesn\u2019t restrict political spending, it stands up to the current Supreme Court\u2019s requirements. \nOther approaches to public campaign financing include voucher systems, where citizens receive certain amounts in public funds they can direct to their preferred candidates. Tax credits for small campaign donations are another way to encourage more people to participate.\n#### Boost Public Funding of Elections"

              "In an era of limited resources and growing mission demands, many \nagencies have turned to approaches other than full up-front funding to \nfinance capital. GAO was asked to inventory examples of alternative \napproaches that agencies have employed to finance the capital used in \ntheir operations.\n\nWhat GAO Found:\n\nCapital projects are fully funded when Congress provides budget \nauthority for the full cost of an asset up front. Such up-front \nfunding provides recognition for commitments that are embodied in \nbudgetary decisions and maintains governmentwide fiscal control. \nHowever, providing budget authority for the large up-front costs of \ncapital assets creates challenges in an era of resource constraints. \nAgencies have been authorized to use an array of approaches to obtain \ncapital assets without full, up-front budget authority. Our work \nidentified 10 alternative financing approaches used by one or more of \n13 agencies. These approaches, which are described in our letter, \n\n* incremental funding,\n* operating leases,\n* retained fees,\n* real property swaps, \n* sale-leasebacks,\n* lease-leasebacks,\n* public private partnerships,\n* outleases,\n* share-in-savings contracts, and\n* debt issuance.",
              "We identified 10 capital financing approaches that have been used by \none or more of 13 federal agencies (see table 1). From an agency's \nperspective, meeting capital needs through alternative financing \napproaches (i.e., not full funding) can be very attractive because the \nagency can obtain the capital asset without first having to secure \nsufficient appropriations to cover the full cost of the asset. \nDepending on the financing approach, an agency may spread the asset \ncost over a number of years or may never even incur a monetary cost \nthat is recognized in the budget. In other words, alternative financing \napproaches can make it easier for agencies to meet mission capital \ndemands within the constraints of their appropriation. As we have \nreported in the past, however, from a governmentwide perspective the \ncosts associated with these financing approaches may be greater than \nwith full, up-front budget authority. Regardless of the financing \napproach used to obtain the capital, agencies would receive the same \nprogram benefits.\n\nTable 1 below shows an array of approaches that agencies have used to \nfinance capital.\n\nTable 1: Alternative Financing Approaches:\n\nAgency: GSA; \nIncremental funding: None; \nOperating lease: PTO building; DOT headquarters; \nRetained fees: Phillip Burton Conf.

              "Community coalitions have increasingly been used as a vehicle to foster improvements in community health. A coalition is traditionally defined as \u201ca group of individuals representing diverse organizations, factions or constituencies who agree to work together to achieve a common goal\u201d (Feighery & Rogers, 1990). Community coalitions differ from other types of coalitions in that they include professional and grassroots members that are committed to working together to influence long-term health and welfare practices in their community (Butterfoss, 2007). Additionally, given their ability to leverage existing resources in the community and convene diverse organizations, community coalitions connote a type of collaboration that is considered to be sustainable over time (Butterfoss, Goodman, & Wandersman, 1993).\nFunders of community coalitions include governmental and non-governmental entities. The federal government often provides short-term initial funding to community coalitions to work toward important health goals that cannot be achieved by a single community organization. Foundations also frequently fund community coalitions and other collaborative partnerships to address key social issues. The presumption is that successful community coalitions will be able to identify new resources to continue their activities and to sustain their impacts in the community over time. Understanding the extent to which coalitions can be sustained post-funding will be important as the federal government continues to invest in innovative community-based strategies to improve the health outcomes of Americans.\n###  B. Purpose and Research Questions",
              "In addition, this literature review will serve as the foundation for developing a framework that may be used to assess the sustainability of community coalitions in the future. The conceptual framework will guide the ASPE study, which uses the experiences of the community coalitions funded by the Community Access Program (CAP)/Healthy Communities Access Program (HCAP) to explore sustainability.\nOne of the largest federal investments to strengthen local health care safety nets through community coalitions was the Community Access Program (CAP) and its successor, the Healthy Communities Access Program (HCAP). From 2000 through 2005, HCAP provided grants to local communities to strengthen the health care safety net that serves the uninsured and underinsured. Congressional funding for CAP began with a $25 million appropriation in the fiscal year (FY) 2000 budget that was used to make grants to 23 coalitions of community organizations and safety net providers. Additional funding provided to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for the program included approximately $500 million from FY 2001 through FY 2005. In total, HRSA awarded 260 grants in 45 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Funding for the program was ended in FY 2006.",
              "One of the ways in which CAP/HCAP distinguished itself from other federal safety net programs was by requiring collaboration. Namely, grants were given to consortia of local providers, rather than individual institutions. The program sought to overcome the fragmented nature of safety net care by bringing together the major players of a community and providing funds to address problems that could not be adequately addressed by individual providers or organizations. The CAP/HCAP-funded coalitions focused on activities such as service integration, expansion of the delivery system, cultural competency, provider education, community and patient education, disease detection and prevention, service integration, and new coverage plans for the uninsured, among others. \nUnderstanding the sustainability of community coalitions is particularly important today given new federal investments in clinical and community-based strategies through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. For example, $373 million of ARRA money will fund community consortia to address the leading causes of preventable death and disability under the Communities Putting Prevention to Work initiative. A more complete understanding of the factors that impede and facilitate coalition sustainability will assist successful coalitions to continue this important work after their initial federal funding ends. \nAn extensive review of the literature in the fields of public health and social sciences (particularly sociology, community psychology, and political science) was conducted in order to identify peer-reviewed articles, reports, and white papers. Boolean search techniques were utilized to conduct these searches\u2014maximizing the number of pertinent articles and minimizing extraneous material. References from relevant papers were used to identify additional sources. Exhibit 1.1 briefly summarizes the literature search strategy."

              "Political organizations possess various characteristics, such as composition, resources, objectives, strategies, and activities, which influence their functions and impact within political or governing systems at different scales. For instance, with their formal organizational structures, political parties frequently clash in electoral politics, striving to change or maintain seats of power in government, usually spanning the geography of a country and operating in the macro-political system (or, as referred to it in this article, the macro-system) (). Due to their often outsider status and informal organizational structures, social movements instead typically engage in extra-political activities like civil disobedience and demonstrations. If these activities succeed, they can draw national attention to their cause, impacting the broader macro-system as well ().\nThis article focuses on another informally structured category of political organization, namely advocacy coalitions. These are the backbone of the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), a policy process theory that studies how actors forge alliances to engage in and steer conflicts over policy and administrative issues. A defining characteristic of advocacy coalitions is that they seek to influence policy change and implementation in policy subsystems\u2014i.e., policy-specific subsets of the macro-system ().\nWhile the ACF scholarship continues to evolve and advance, opportunities always exist for further innovations and refinements. In this study, we examine and link two aspects of advocacy coalitions that have so far remained understudied: first, their involvement and mobilization at two levels of collective action (i.e., the macro-system and policy subsystems), and second, the possibility of deep core beliefs acting as the unifying force among members."

              "The cumulative evidence tends to support the propositions of the textbook Advocacy Coalition Theory. For example, empirical evidence has supported the argument for two or more stable coalitions when differences in policy core beliefs might escalate into conflict, but not without nuances and exceptions. In their study of U.S. automotive pollution control over 26 years, Zafonte and Sabatier () analyzed legislative testimonies at congressional hearings to find two advocacy coalitions, one for strict and the other for weak standards. They also observed changes in coalition composition for both coalitions and the emergence of a third coalition (pursuing moderate standards) over time. However, they also found little support for the expectation that policy core beliefs would be more stable than secondary beliefs. For studies of advocacy coalitions over time, Zafonte and Sabatier's findings are not unusual with the identification of stable coalitions with some members leaving, defecting, or joining over an extended period, and mixed results in the relative stability of the ACF's different belief system levels.\nOther studies have explored the mechanisms of coalition stability. For example, studies have examined how the devil shift contributes to coalition stability. Kingiri () used multiple methods (e.g., interviews and documents) to examine the biosafety subsystem in Kenya and found that the devil shift contributed to sustaining an advocacy coalition and limiting learning between coalitions."

              "### 2.2. State-created coalition opportunities\nCoalitions may also be initiated by those within the state who are seeking to advantage low-income marginalized groups. State-led collaborative engagements with civil society are longstanding and substantive (Evans, ; Ostrom, ). Political parties have sought alliances with civil society to strengthen new approaches to longstanding political and governance challenges (Hickey & Sen, ; Houtzager & Moore, ). Turning to city examples, Guti\u00e9rrez et al. () analyse how non-aligned politicians have used these approaches to reduce urban violence in Colombia: \nThe \u2018miracles\u2019 cannot be understood without dealing with urban politics and in particular with the ability of innovative politicians to successfully create viable transformational coalitions within the city. [\u2026] By comparing the differing trajectories of Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn, on the one hand, and Cali, on the other, we can focus on how and why coalitions make a difference. (p. 3136)\nGaventa and McGee () argue that \u2018alliances between social actors and champions of change inside the state are critical to make policy change happen\u2019 (p. 24). But policy changes that favour low-income groups are tricky to secure and hard to maintain. Brazilian policy councils were initiated to provide \u2018institutionalised spaces mediating among civil society organizations, city dwellers and the state\u2019 and councils used the enhanced participatory processes under the 1998 constitution to improve inclusion (Pimentel Walker & Friendly, , p. 436). However, a study in the two cities of S\u00e3o Paulo and Niter\u00f3i highlights that, although the councils have acted very much as multi-stakeholder coalitions (in terms of the definition given above), and have helped to address poverty through regularizing informal neighbourhoods, they have been used by real estate interests to marginalize low-income groups and secure municipal support for private-sector inner-city redevelopment (Pimentel Walker & Friendly, ).",
              "The interest of urban social movements in coalitions appears well founded. Evidence suggests that civil society state coalitions may support reform, making cities more politically inclusive, with more equitable outcomes. Coalitions have the potential to encourage cross-class collaboration (McAdam et al., ; Nelson, ), and improve democratic governance (Gaventa & McGee, ; McAdam et al., ). Coalitions appear to be effective \u2013 at least in part \u2013 because they change elite positions and priorities through deepening their understanding (framing) of disadvantaged groups (McAdam et al., ), resulting in more favourable politics (even if they are seen as oppositional groups) (Iraz\u00e1bal, ; Mouffe, ; Ramirez et al., ; Stone, ).",
              "Coalitional politics is being used by multiple urban social movements \u2013 and agencies that support their work \u2013 to address the scale and nature of disadvantage in towns and cities of the Global South. To advance our understanding about how coalitions might form and function effectively, this paper introduces and analyses four diverse exemplars that illustrate the approaches used. We find that coalitions have the potential to improve the relational capital of disadvantaged residents, increasing the legitimacy of their claims, advancing their interests and leading to pro-poor reforms. Coalitions enhance existing political opportunities and potentially improve the political opportunity structure. However, context matters, particularly the nature and extent of local democracy, and coalitions must operate in a space that is circumscribed and contested.\n\u6539\u9769\u8054\u76df\u5bf9\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8d21\u732e: \u57ce\u5e02\u793e\u4f1a\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u6559\u8bad\u3002. \u591a\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u793e\u4f1a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u90a3\u4e9b\u652f\u6301\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u673a\u6784, \u6b63\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8054\u76df\u653f\u6cbb\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u57ce\u9547\u4e2d\u52a3\u52bf\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u672c\u8d28\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u52a0\u6df1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8054\u76df\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u4f5c\u5730\u7406\u89e3, \u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5e76\u4e14\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u793a\u4f8b, \u4ee5\u8bf4\u660e\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e, \u8054\u76df\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6539\u5584\u5f31\u52bf\u5c45\u6c11\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8d44\u672c, \u589e\u52a0\u5176\u8bc9\u6c42\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u6027, \u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u5229\u76ca, \u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u7a77\u4eba\u7684\u6539\u9769\u3002\u6b64\u5916, \u8054\u76df\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u673a\u4f1a, \u5e76\u5177\u5907\u6539\u5584\u653f\u6cbb\u673a\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c, \u80cc\u666f\u5f88\u91cd\u8981, \u7279\u522b\u662f\u5730\u65b9\u6c11\u4e3b\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6, \u8054\u76df\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002"

              "Political feasibility is at the center of air-pollution policymaking in the developing world, affecting both the choices of policies and their implementation outcomes. Using India as a test case, we demonstrate how political considerations (e.g., public opinion, market structure, and government capacity) can be incorporated into quantitative models for environmental impact assessment. By examining a wide range of clean-air policies across the electricity, industrial, transportation, residential, and agricultural sectors, we find that policies with a great potential to mitigate air pollution can have varying degrees of political feasibility. Because some lower-feasibility policies also co-reduce carbon emissions (e.g., phasing out existing coal units), considering the effects of political feasibility is particularly important in achieving air-pollution and climate objectives simultaneously.",
              "Political-feasibility concerns are at the center of real-world air-pollution policymaking. Yet, these concerns are often not represented in leading decision-support tools that have been used for assessing policies' environmental impacts. Focusing on a wide range of clean-air policies in India, we assess their political-feasibility scores on the basis of public opinion, market, and institutional considerations and then incorporate these scores into the evaluation of environmental impacts by using an integrated assessment model (GAINS-South Asia). We demonstrate that although some policies with substantial potential to mitigate air pollution are also highly politically feasible (e.g., replacing solid fuels with cleaner fuels in households), others can be less politically feasible (e.g., banning agricultural waste burning). Because some clean-air policies co-reduce CO emissions and aerosols, considering varying degrees of political feasibility is particularly important in achieving air-pollution and climate objectives simultaneously because of its implications on the implementation scale and policy sequence."

              "Most earlier studies addressing factors contributing to Medicare costs (mostly defined as government payments) rely on relationships among geographic area means (e.g., ; [Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences 1999](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3165175/#b5); ;). Area-based analyses are particularly prone to bias from unmeasured demand or supply factors likely to confound relationships among area averages (Zuckerman et al. 2010). Moreover, beneficiaries within geographic areas are likely to have heterogeneous characteristics, within-area distributions of variables are likely to vary considerably across areas, and often will not be normally distributed (e.g., health status). As a result, associations among area means and ratios will likely deviate from those that would be estimated at the individual patient level (). Consequently, we estimate determinants of Medicare expenditures (costs) at the beneficiary level.\nAlthough no study can avoid specification bias by including all relevant variables, our study investigates a substantial number of both demand and supply-side variables, many of which were not included in previous work. Finally, we compare factors contributing to the costs of treating two sets of Medicare beneficiaries, based on their expected medical costs. It is important to understand how potential effects differ, because the factors that drive the utilization of high-cost beneficiaries are of greatest policy import.",
              "The 2006 average standardized medical cost for predicted high-cost beneficiaries was nearly U.S.$48,000, compared with about U.S.$7,000 for predicted low-cost patients (). (Median values were U.S.$37,704 and U.S.$3,406, respectively.) Overall, 69 percent of total costs were spent on the 25 percent classified as predicted high-cost beneficiaries. This is lower than the 85 percent typically reported for the 25 percent most costly beneficiaries because of our inability to perfectly predict high and low-cost users, the fact that we are using standardized costs, which truncates some outlier cases, and the exclusion of beneficiaries who received no Medicare services. Medicare payments were a higher percentage of total standardized costs among high-cost beneficiaries (88 versus 82 percent), reflecting greater use of Part A services. For instance, 79 and 84 percent of expenditures on hospitals and postacute care were incurred by predicted high-cost beneficiaries, respectively, compared with about 50 percent of physician service and outpatient costs. Inpatient and postacute care accounted for 63 percent of total costs of predicted high-cost beneficiaries, as compared with 34 percent for predicted low-cost beneficiaries.\nAnnual Standardized Costs and Medicare Payments among Predicted High- and Low-Cost Medicare Beneficiaries  \nMean Costs, Given Any Use | % of Total Costsin Category | Mean Costs, Given Any Use | % of Total Costs in Category | % of Costs Incurred by Predicted High-Cost Beneficiaries  \n\u201cOther\u201d includes clinical lab services, durable medical equipment, Part B drugs, hospice care, psychiatric facility care, and long-term care hospital care.\npresents multivariable results for predicted high-and low-cost beneficiaries. Along with model coefficients, we assess variables' relative importance by reporting elasticities for continuous variables and the coefficient as a percent of mean standardized costs for categorical variables.",
              "The Medicare fee difference variable generated the largest elasticities. Consistent with our hypothesis and previous research, higher relative fees are associated with greater service provision (; ;). The estimated elasticity is larger (0.41) among low-cost beneficiaries than among high-cost beneficiaries (0.23), suggesting physicians may exercise greater discretion in the treatment of healthier beneficiaries.\nAlthough models estimated over the entire sample of low- and high-cost patients explain two-thirds of the variation in beneficiaries' medical costs, several limitations should be noted. First, causal inferences should be made cautiously because the data are cross-sectional. Second, unobserved heterogeneity in the beneficiary population could be correlated with model variables and bias coefficients. Third, available data limit our ability to characterize all key features of local health care markets (e.g., level of care coordination). Fourth, there is no definitive way to define local healthcare markets and our use of counties for most market variables is driven by available data. Finally, the sample is only approximately representative of the elderly, non-ESRD Medicare beneficiaries because it excludes Medicare Advantage enrollees, new enrollees, and beneficiaries because use no physician services over an extended time period, and it uses an indirect sampling method.\nA final limitation is that our study focused only on costs, without considering effects on outcomes (for which claims data are not particularly suited). Though not reported here, we constructed mortality and ambulatory sensitive hospitalization rates (which are analyzed in another study). We did attempt to identify factors that were efficiency enhancing or diminishing by estimating parallel reduced-form models, but the results were ambiguous."

              "To measure this concept, one must measure costs, select appropriate outcome measures, determine whether and how to combine them, and compare state scores. Based on the methods used in the studies reviewed, a three-phased approach is recommended. First, MPR proposes to construct measures of costs per enrollee, stratified by enrollee categories. We also propose to standardize or adjust costs for factors that influence variation in state Medicaid spending that are clearly beyond state Medicaid agency control. Second, MPR would examine quality and access to care measures for which data is available across all or most states to assess whether variation in outcomes and variation in costs appear to be linked. Because the literature provides less guidance for Medicaid quality and other outcome measurement than for expenditure analyses, we will continue to seek input on appropriate outcome measures to be used. Third, MPR will assess alternate ways to rank and compare state performance on cost and outcome measures.\n##  Measuring Medicaid Spending and Costs\nCalculating per enrollee cost measures that support accurate cross-state comparisons requires several technical decisions, including: (1) how to stratify Medicaid enrollees to create reasonably similar comparison groups, (2) whether to examine costs for specific services and if so, how to identify service costs for enrollees in managed care plans, (3) whether to include or exclude costs that cannot be attributed to individual enrollees, such as administrative costs and disproportionate share hospital payments, and (4) how to adjust for factors that are beyond the control of state Medicaid agencies.",
              "Since the proportion of total enrollees in these groups varies by state, we could: (1) examine per enrollee expenditures separately for each of the subgroups, or (2) present only group-level (for example, aged) per enrollee expenditures, but standardize the measures so the proportion of enrollees within each subgroup (for example, aged/dual eligible, aged/not dual eligible) is held constant in assessing overall group level per enrollee expenditures. Because limited-benefit enrollees (for example, adults qualifying only for family planning services) account for a small proportion of Medicaid spending and receive very few services, we do not recommend including them in analyses of per enrollee expenditures.\nService Costs and Medicaid Managed Care. Measures of efficiency often focus on cost per unit of service. In the Medicaid context, this would mean comparing spending per enrollee for discrete service categories, such as hospital inpatient care, prescription drugs, nursing home care, and physician visits. But lower cost per service does not necessarily produce higher value in terms of better quality or other outcomes. In addition, from the purchaser\u2019s perspective, efficiency could result from a different of services provided to enrollees, which argues against analyzing costs at the unit of service level.",
              "For these reasons, we recommend (1) measuring state Medicaid spending for population subgroups for two broad categories of services---acute care and long-term-care---rather than for specific services, and (2) combining fee-for-service (FFS) and managed care populations in each of these two service categories, to the extent that enrollees in managed care organizations (MCOs) can be divided into those receiving primarily acute care versus long-term care services. This higher level of aggregation should produce useful comparisons across states about the efficiency or value obtained through the mix of services provided, and through greater or lesser use of capitated or other forms of managed care compared to fee-for-service payment and delivery models. It is also a practical decision; limitations in the availability of service-specific expenditure data for Medicaid managed care enrollees, whose care is paid on a capitation basis, would restrict detailed comparisons of per-service costs to a small subset of states with little managed care enrollment, or to the long-term care sector where managed care is not as prevalent.\n. Numerous studies and reports highlight large variation in the amount and proportion of total state Medicaid spending on DSH expenditures. However, since DSH payments, and other payments cannot be attributed to individual Medicaid enrollees, and DSH payments cover the cost of care for non-Medicaid, indigent individuals, we do not recommend including these costs in our analysis."

The broad rationale for estimating the marginal cost per unit of health produced by the healthcare system in these reviewed studies was to guide health funding decisions. Where the true opportunity cost is unknown, that is, when decisions to fund a new health technology or intervention do not specify what is to be forgone, then an empirical estimate can provide the next best option to quantify the net health impact."

              "To what extent does the research on the long-run effects of the social safety net line up with these predictions? First, there is consistent evidence that social safety net investments during childhood lead to improved adult human capital and economic outcomes as well as health. Aizer (2016) examine an early 20th century cash welfare program and find that additional income in childhood leads to greater educational attainment, income, body weight, and life expectancy. Increased family resources during childhood through the Earned Income Tax Credit have been shown to increase children\u2019s cognitive outcomes (; , ) as well as educational attainment and employment in young adulthood (). While perhaps less mechanistically connected to the increase in resources from these near-cash programs, related work shows that public investments through Head Start preschools and Medicaid also lead to improvements in adult human capital and health. The evidence on the relative importance of exposure is more mixed. show the beneficial effects of Food Stamps on adult metabolic health derive from exposure prior to age five. Aizer (2016) provide suggestive evidence that the positive effects of cash welfare may be larger for children exposed at younger ages. , however, find that larger EITC payments during the teen years, rather than early childhood, drive the increases in educational attainment and earnings in young adulthood.\nAnother mechanism for long-run effects of Food Stamps is a reduction in stress. Recent work shows that lower socio-economic status may be causally related to stress hormones ( cortisol) and that additional resources may attenuate this relationship (; ; ).

              "Now that this brief has addressed core characteristics of cash transfer programs, what does the literature say about their effectiveness? This is a challenging question, because cash transfer programs are necessarily context-dependent ([Zhao et al., 2023 [Ch. 2]](https://utorontopress.com/9781487545178/cash-transfers-for-inclusive-societies/); ). Each program unfolds in a specific social context with unique eligibility criteria and disbursements, all of which influence generalizability. Moreover, the specific objectives of a program (e.g., reducing the number of nights spent homeless vs. improving child nutrition) inform its methods (e.g., cash plus housing vouchers vs. cash plus child healthcare access). \nNonetheless, researchers have reported on the general impacts of cash transfers by looking across many programs and summarizing findings using meta-analysis or systematic review. These studies have largely supported the efficacy of conditional and unconditional cash transfers in lifting individuals out of poverty and improving a range of positive outcomes.",
              "Conditional cash transfer programs have mostly been implemented in low- and middle-income countries, targeting families with young children. The short term effectiveness of these programs has been well established, with reviews showing that conditional cash transfers raise savings and investments by around 10-20% of the size of the transfer without reducing labor force participation (), positively influence household consumption by better balancing spending and saving (), and increase the use of preventative health services while improving objective and subjective health (). Regarding young children, conditional cash transfers lower rates of child labor, particularly for boys (), improve school enrollment and attendance (), increase the uptake of maternal and newborn health services (), and generally benefit child health by improving access to care, increasing child and maternal nutrition and immunizations, and reducing morbidity risk and household poverty (). Conditional cash transfers may be more effective in middle-income (vs. low-income) countries, as these countries more often have functional health systems that recipients can use their cash to access (; ).\nSome reviews have tried to estimate the longer-term effects of conditional cash transfers, asking whether these programs break intergenerational cycles of poverty. Evidence for this is considerably more mixed: conditional cash transfers appear to provide some important long-term impacts on schooling, but evidence for other outcomes is limited due to methodological challenges or weak/non-existent long-term impacts ().",
              "In sum, both conditional and unconditional cash transfers appear effective at improving a range of financial, health, and education outcomes. Conditional programs have a longer research history and are mostly conducted in low- and middle-income countries, whereas unconditional programs are relatively newer approaches favored by Western nations like the U.S. and Canada. Although most evidence is on individuals in poverty (rather than individuals experiencing homelessness), recent reviews suggest that programs are most beneficial for the poorest and most vulnerable recipients (Neighly et al., 2022). This suggests that these programs may be highly effective in helping people experiencing homelessness, and two pioneering programs in the U.S. and Canada are now directly testing these questions.\n## What are some examples of direct cash transfer programs targeting people experiencing homelessness?\nAs referenced earlier, , , and the maintain databases of active and past cash transfer programs.

              "Further research is needed to better understand the characteristics of cash transfer programs that facilitate access to child care and support employment. While traditional economic theory predicts (and have suggested) that unconditional cash transfers will lead to a decline in labor force participation, more recent studies of the employment effects of the \u2014as well as a similar [child benefit program in Canada](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28556/w28556.pdf) that used real-world data and a \u2014found no evidence of a negative labor market response. Meanwhile, the decision to enter the labor force or increase the number of hours worked is complex for parents of young children. A [recent review of the research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9331-3) on child care use and labor force participation among parents of young children suggests that increased access to child care\u2014through reduced out-of-pocket costs or increased availability of public early care and education programs\u2014has positive impacts on maternal labor force participation and work hours; however, the findings also point to considerable variation across different family situations.\nAs this brief has illustrated, the evidence base indicates that cash transfers support infant and toddler development and address an ongoing need for American families with low incomes. Families with low incomes often need additional income support to meet their family\u2019s basic needs; cash transfers do this effectively by allowing families the how to spend their payments to reduce the stressors associated with having a low income and best support their children\u2019s development. To help federal, state, and local policymakers craft new\u2014and strengthen existing\u2014cash transfer initiatives that support infant and toddler development and well-being, we provide four policy recommendations.",
              "Policymakers should implement cash transfer programs as a supplement to existing social safety net programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, and housing subsidies. At present, most cash transfer programs like the EITC and expanded CTC are, alone, not sufficient to meet the full needs of families with infants and toddlers. Instead, they allow families the flexibility to meet needs that are unsupported by other parts of the social safety net. Policymakers should consider cash transfer programs to be one of several important tools in the poverty reduction toolbox and implement them as part of a comprehensive approach to poverty reduction. Furthermore, the impact of poverty reduction strategies such as cash transfers when used in combination with other strategies to lift families out of poverty. In order to effectively combine policy reduction strategies, policymakers should also ensure that, when implementing cash transfer programs, cash transfer benefits families\u2019 eligibility for other benefits.\nThis brief was a team effort.

              "## The Evidence on Cash Transfers\nWhile on the impact of cash transfers continues to build\u2014and there is still much to learn about what benefit amounts are effective, for whom, and in what contexts\u2014there is nonetheless a strong and compelling evidence base, laid out in this section, that cash transfers can effectively support the heathy development and well-being of young children and lay the foundation for improved outcomes throughout children\u2019s lifetimes. Indeed, a of a U.S. child allowance\u2014based on a systematic review of the evidence for the effects of cash transfers on child development and later outcomes\u2014found that a $1,000 increase in family income in one year for a single-parent family with one child generated social benefits five times greater than the initial investment (via reduced health care costs, crime, need for child protection services, etc.).\n### Cash transfers help parents with low incomes meet the essential needs of infants and toddlers.\nParents with low incomes who have infants and toddlers face barriers in meeting their children\u2019s essential needs, such as reliable nutrition and stable housing. The importance of for young children ; however, of all infants and toddlers nationally are growing up with low or very low food security, meaning that their families needed to reduce the quality and/or the quantity of food in their diets due to budgetary restrictions. , for young children is also linked to healthy child development, yet compared to infants and toddlers in families with higher incomes, those in families with low incomes were twice as likely to experience housing insecurity (4% and 2%, respectively) and three times as likely to live in crowded housing ( respectively), likely due to limited availability of ."

In\u2010kind transfers have demonstrable benefits for families (Ellen, ; McKernan, Ratcliffe, & Braga, ; Schwartz, Horn, Ellen, & Cordes, ; Shaefer & Gutierrez, ) and there is growing interest in the United States in combining these forms of assistance with conditional and unconditional cash payments (Gennetian, Shafir, Aber, & De Hoop, ; National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, ).\nCash transfer programs typically take one of three forms in the United States: (1) tax credits for lower\u2010income working families, including the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit; (2) payments to eligible households from industry\u2010related cash distributions, such as payments to Native American households from casino profits or to Alaska state residents from the trans\u2010Alaska oil pipeline and (3) and direct cash payments to low\u2010income and other vulnerable groups through guaranteed income programs.

The first three groups used various research designs and data sources; we describe the methods and scope and highlight key challenges to determining and interpreting causal effects. The final set of studies (GI RCTs) have not measured impacts on child abuse and neglect; nevertheless, they provide insight into how cash affects parental stress, mental health, and financial security\u2014the very mechanisms through which income is expected to reduce maltreatment.\nAll these programs provide direct financial assistance, but they vary in design. TANF is a federal block grant program that gives funding to states to provide cash aid and other support to low-income families with children, with benefits that are time limited and accompanied by work requirements. More than half of TANF cases are child only\u2014that is, benefits are provided solely on the child\u2019s behalf. These cases are typically exempt from work requirements or time limits.\nSNAP offers monthly benefits to help households purchase food. The EITC is a refundable federal tax credit, and many states have supplemental EITCs that may or may not be refundable. These credits are typically accessible to working families with low-to-moderate incomes. The CTC is a tax credit provided to nearly all tax filers with dependent children. A portion of the credit is \u201crefundable,\u201d meaning families with little or no tax liability can still receive cash back from the government. By contrast, GI programs provide unconditional cash payments directly to individuals or families without restrictions on how the money is spent."

              "## How is the Medicaid program financed?\nUnlike Medicare, which is run by the federal government, Medicaid is jointly financed and jointly administered by states, territories, and the federal government. Since the Medicaid program was created in 1965, the federal government has matched state spending on Medicaid services and other costs by contributing a certain percentage of funds. This percentage \u2013 which is called the federal medical assistance percentage, or FMAP \u2013 is calculated using a formula defined by Congress that compares each state\u2019s rolling three-year average per capita income to the United States\u2019 per capita income. This results in states with lower per capita incomes receiving a higher contribution rate and states with higher per capita incomes receiving a lower contribution rate; all states have a maximum FMAP rate of 83 percent and a minimum FMAP rate of 50 percent for this base FMAP.\nMedicaid\u2019s financing structure [can be traced to its roots](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4194918/) in the public assistance system. In 1950, Congress passed a [set of amendments to the Social Security Act](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v13n10/v13n10p3.pdf) to provide states with federal matching funds for certain medical services provided to individuals who were receiving cash assistance. Then, in 1960, the Kerr-Mills Act created the Medical Assistance for the Aged program, which for health care services for certain older adults. When Congress created the Medicaid and Medicare programs through the [Social Security Amendments of 1965](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-79/pdf/STATUTE-79-Pg286.pdf), they retained the federal-state financing structure of the Kerr-Mills Act and adopted the FMAP formula that is still used today.",
              "The federal match rate for most Medicaid-covered services follows this statutorily defined formula. However, , including different FMAP rates for certain populations, providers, and activities. Congress often uses higher \u2013 or \u201cenhanced\u201d \u2013 FMAP rates to states and territories to cover certain services or populations or, alternatively, FMAP reductions to penalize states for not complying with federal requirements. For example, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 [created a time-limited FMAP increase](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/home-community-based-services/guidance-additional-resources/strengthening-and-investing-home-and-community-based-services-for-medicaid-beneficiaries-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-section-9817/index.html) for activities that \u201cenhance, expand, or strengthen\u201d home and community-based services. Congress has also used FMAP enhancements to provide broader fiscal relief to states and territories, including through a .\nImportantly, the five U.S. Territories \u2013 American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands \u2013 have a than the states. The territories\u2019 FMAP rate is set by Congress, instead of using the FMAP formula defined in statute. Historically, the Territories\u2019 FMAP rates were all set at 55%. , Congress permanently increased the FMAP rate to 83% for American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and temporarily increased Puerto Rico\u2019s FMAP to 76%. Additionally, the territories\u2019 federal funding is capped, meaning that once the territories reach their funding allotments each year, they must use entirely local funds to pay for Medicaid-covered services or take steps to manage the lack of additional federal funds, such as reducing the benefits they cover or pausing payments to providers.",
              "How do states and territories fund the \u201cstate share\u201d \u2013 or nonfederal portion \u2013 of Medicaid costs? [According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO)](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-98), in 2018, 68 percent of state share came from state general revenue (which includes state income tax, sales tax, property tax, and fees), while the remaining 32 percent came from local government, taxes on providers, and other sources. As explored below, both federal match and state share play important roles in a state\u2019s budget.\nWhy is Medicaid important to state and territory budgets?\nMedicaid plays a significant role in state and territory budgets. [According to the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO)](https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NASBO/9d2d2db1-c943-4f1b-b750-0fca152d64c2/UploadedImages/SER%20Archive/2024_SER/2024_State_Expenditure_Report_S.pdf), Medicaid was the largest total spending category for states in FY2024, representing about 30 percent of total state expenditures from all sources. However, it is important to note that federal funds \u2013 including federal Medicaid matching funds \u2013 are included in this calculation; when looking only at state general fund expenditures, Medicaid\u2019s footprint shrinks, representing 18.7 percent of general fund expenditures. This is still a substantial share of state resources, coming second only to education, meaning Medicaid plays a central role in state budget processes."

The match rate for most Medicaid enrollees is determined by a formula in the law that provides a match of at least 50% and provides a higher federal match rate for states with lower per capita income (Figure 5). States may receive a higher match rate for certain services and populations. The ACA expansion group is financed with a 90% federal match rate, so states pay 10%, and the American Rescue Plan Act included an additional to states that newly adopt the Medicaid expansion; however, the tax and spending law eliminated the incentive, effective January 1, 2026. In FY 2023, Medicaid spending totaled of which was federal spending. Medicaid typically accelerates during economic downturns as enrollment increases. Spending growth also peaked after the implementation of the ACA and, more recently, due to enrollment growth tied to the pandemic-related continuous enrollment provision.\nOverall, Medicaid accounts for a large share of most states\u2019 budgets and is often central to state fiscal decisions; however, state spending on Medicaid is second to state spending on elementary and secondary education, and the program is also the largest source of federal revenue for states. In 3, Medicaid accounted for 30% of total state expenditures, 15% of expenditures from state funds (general funds and other funds), and 57% of expenditures from federal funds received by the state.",

Section 1115 waivers have been used over time and generally reflect priorities identified by the states as well as from one presidential administration to another (Figure 18). Waivers have been to expand coverage or benefits, change policies for existing Medicaid populations (e.g., testing premiums or other eligibility requirements), modify delivery systems, restructure financing or authorize new payments (e.g., supplemental payments or incentive-based payments), as well as make other program changes.",

Areas of focus during the included leveraging Medicaid to address (including housing instability, homelessness, nutrition insecurity) and to provide health care to individuals back into the community. Several states also received approval to provide multi-year for children. Recent actions from the new Trump administration could signal efforts to curtail waivers related to of health, and to limit 1115 waiver and flexibility. In addition, several states are seeking approval for work requirements waivers. Although the tax and spending reconciliation law now includes a national work requirement, some states may continue to pursue waivers to implement work requirements prior to January 1, 2027 when the national requirement goes into effect.\nVarious types of waivers and other emergency authorities can also be used to respond to emergencies. These can help expand Medicaid capacity and focus on specific services, providers, or groups of enrollees that may be particularly impacted.

              "Starting in the 1970s, Congress extended Medicaid coverage to new kinds of beneficiaries by granting states flexibility to provide benefits in nontraditional ways. This was accomplished by permitting CMS to waive various operational requirements on states for providing benefits. These waivers are permitted primarily under two sections of the Social Security Act. Section 1115 authorizes CMS to allow experiments through demonstration programs. These may be used for testing alternative forms of payment, such as managed care and prospective payment for hospitals, and for alternative care arrangements, such as expanded access to home and community-based services (HCBS) for beneficiaries who would otherwise require institutionalization. An estimated six million people benefit from these services. Section 1915 authorizes CMS to permit implementation of changes such as these on an ongoing basis. More comprehensive waivers were authorized by section 1332 the ACA for innovative plans to expand coverage for the overall population.\nHCBS waivers represent a significant part of the Medicaid program, and most are granted under Section 1915(c). The services they cover represent more than half of Medicaid spending on long-term care. Some of them permit access to HCBS for children regardless of family income. Covered services can include assistive technology, behavioral support, communication support, family and caregiver training and support, shift nursing, transportation, and physical, occupational, and speech therapy. HCBS coverage may also be available for children through Medicaid\u2019s Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. Services covered under that program include early detection of conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability and preventive care in addition to medically necessary services.",
              "To fully understand the nature of Medicaid and its variation between states, the obvious structural elements of eligibility and coverage rules tell only part of the story. States can also affect Medicaid\u2019s reach through administrative regulations for obtaining and maintaining enrollment. These rules can create barriers to enrollment with strict requirements that are especially difficult for those with limited financial means to meet. Conversely, they can ease enrollment by permitting more flexibility in compliance. By affecting the size of state Medicaid programs, these rules can shape the implementation of policy goals in a way that largely escapes public notice. A growing body of empirical research has described the nature and extent of their impact.\nCongress has taken two recent steps to limit the impact of administrative requirements as barriers to Medicaid enrollment. The first was enactment of provisions of the Affordable Care Act that directed states to loosen various requirements. The second was provisions of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act that offered states a financial incentive to ease administrative rules and placed a moratorium on disenrollment during the Covid Public Health Emergency. However, restrictive rules returned in many states with the end the Emergency with consequent disenrollment of millions, a poignant demonstration of the importance of administrative requirements as drivers of the size and shape of state Medicaid programs.\nThis Article describes the nature of important administrative requirements that can affect enrollment, reviews empirical evidence of their influence, and proposes three reforms that could dampen the effects of restrictive rules.",
              "This structure has led to considerable variation in Medicaid eligibility between states and between types of beneficiaries. For example, in 2023, the income threshold for parents of dependent children in Alabama was 18% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and 288% of the FPL for children in Minnesota. Variation is even more pronounced in eligibility based on specific conditions.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) reduced the variation in eligibility criteria considerably. It required states to cover all residents whose incomes fell below 133% of the FPL without regard to categories. This meant that adults who are not in families with children could qualify. The federal government pays 90% of the incremental cost. However, participation in the expansion was made voluntary for states by a ruling of the Supreme Court in 2012, so variation remains between the jurisdictions that have accepted it, which currently number forty-one, and those that have not, which currently number ten.\nYet another layer of variation remains beyond the obvious structural elements of eligibility and coverage. To gain and maintain coverage, individuals must comply with numerous administrative requirements that vary across states. Examples include requirements for re-application at regular intervals, for face-to-face interviews as part of the application process, and for asset tests. On first blush, these may appear to be merely technical rules with minimal effect on participation. However, some of them can have a substantial impact that escapes widespread public notice."

              "Published: Jul 30, 2015. Publicly Released: Aug 31, 2015. \nMore than 80 federal programs (including 6 tax expenditures) provide aid to people with low incomes, based on GAO's survey of relevant federal agencies. Medicaid (the largest by far), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) comprised almost two-thirds of fiscal year 2013 federal obligations of $742 billion for these programs. Aid is most often targeted to groups of the low-income population, such as people with disabilities and workers with children. Survey responses showed that criteria used to determine eligibility vary greatly; most common were variants of the federal poverty guidelines, based on the Census Bureau's official poverty measure.\nIn 2013, 48.7 million people (15.5 percent), including many households with children, lived in poverty in the United States, based on Census's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). This measure takes into account certain expenses and federal and state government benefits not included in the official poverty measure. The SPM is not used to determine program eligibility; however, it does provide more information than the official measure on household resources available to meet living expenses. In 2013, the SPM poverty threshold ranged from $21,397 to $25,639 for a family of four, depending on housing situations. Based on six mutually exclusive household types GAO developed, individuals in a household headed by a person with a disability or a single parent had the highest rates of poverty using the SPM, while childless or married parent households had larger numbers of people in poverty using the SPM.",
              "In 2012, the most recent year of data available, GAO estimated that 106 million people, or one-third of the U.S. population, received benefits from at least one or more of eight selected federal low-income programs: Additional Child Tax Credit, EITC, SNAP, SSI, and four others. Almost two-thirds of the eight programs' recipients were in households with children, including many married families. More than 80 percent of recipients also lived in households with some earned income during the year. Without these programs' benefits, GAO estimated that 25 million of these recipients would have been below the SPM poverty threshold. Of the eight programs, EITC and SNAP moved the most people out of poverty, however, the majority of recipients of each of the programs were estimated to have incomes above the SPM threshold, after accounting for receipt of benefits.\nResearch suggests that assistance from selected means-tested low-income programs can encourage people's participation in the labor force, but have mixed effects on the number of hours they work. Changes in certain low-income programs through the years, including the EITC, have enhanced incentives for people to join the labor force, according to studies. While workers who receive means-tested benefits face benefit reductions as their earnings rise, research shows that various factors limit how much people change their work behavior in response. For example, people may not be aware of such changing interactions in a complex tax and benefit system or be able to control the number of hours they work, according to studies. Research also shows that enhancing work incentives can create difficult policy trade-offs, including raising program costs or failing to provide adequate assistance to those in need.\n##  Why GAO Did This Study",
              "The federal government provides assistance aimed at helping people with low-incomes who may earn too little to meet their basic needs, cannot support themselves through work, or who are disadvantaged in other ways. With fiscal pressures facing the federal government and the demands placed on aid programs, GAO was asked to examine federal low-income programs.\nThis report (1) describes federal programs (including tax expenditures) targeted to people with low incomes, (2) identifies the number and selected household characteristics of people in poverty, (3) identifies the number, poverty status, and household characteristics of selected programs' recipients, and (4) examines research on how selected programs may affect incentives to work. For a list of low-income programs that were $100 million in obligations or more in fiscal year 2013, GAO consulted with the Congressional Research Service; surveyed and interviewed officials at relevant federal agencies; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency guidance. GAO also conducted analyses on low-income individuals using Census data on the SPM and official poverty measure and microsimulation data from the Urban Institute that adjusts for under-reporting of benefit receipt in Census survey data. To examine labor force effects, GAO reviewed economic literature. Selected low-income programs were large in dollars and helped meet a range of basic needs.\nGAO is not making new recommendations in this report. GAO clarified portions in response to comments from one agency.\nFor more information, contact Kay Brown at (202) 512-7215 or ."

              "In the half century since President Lyndon B. Johnson declared an unconditional War on Poverty, the Federal Government has invested in strategies that aim to relieve and prevent poverty. Partly as a result of these programs, and a large number of additions and reforms since then, between 1967 and 2012, poverty measured by a measure that accounts for tax and transfer payments 9.8 percentage points, or 38 percent. In 2013, income and nutrition assistance programs lifted 46 million people, including 10 million children, out of the poverty. Medicaid has also resulted in better health care for tens of millions of Americans. Another 16 million people have gained coverage the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage expansions, as of early 2015.\nInnovative economic research is increasingly finding that these programs have long-run benefits for the children in families that receive them. These studies often drawn upon large \u201cadministrative\u201d data sets that are collected in the process of running government programs. These data sources frequently allow researchers to track families over long periods of time with limited attrition, offer much larger sample sizes, and suffer from less missing data than major household surveys. These improvements in data quality have coincided with a \u201c\u201d in economics that has greatly expanded the use of randomized trials and \u201cquasi-experimental\u201d research designs that exploit natural experiments to estimate the causal impact of the programs.\nThe following is a selection of research in this area for five major current programs\u2014early education, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (SNAP), housing vouchers, and Medicaid\u2014plus one historical income support program.\n1.

              "Cash transfers (CTs), for all their evident success in relieving poverty, have been criticised for failing to incorporate transformative elements into their programme design. In recent years changes have been introduced into the design of CT programmes that go some way towards addressing this concern. This article critically engages the meaning of transformative social protection and introduces a collection of papers that examine whether and under what conditions cash transfers can be \u2018transformative\u2019. Among the issues addressed are whether CTs can be catalysts leading to positive changes, material, subjective and relational in the lives of poor people; what are the social effects of CTs for beneficiaries, their households and communities; and can they foster horizontal relationships within communities and vertical relationship with the state through developing forms of social accountability and citizenship engagement?\nWith the eradication of extreme poverty as a priority Millennium Development Goal, cash transfer programmes (CTPs) spread rapidly across the world to reach more than 750 million people in low and middle-income countries in the global south by 2010 (Arnold, Conway, & Greenslade, ). As new programmes multiplied, older ones expanded their coverage to reach significant numbers of targeted populations in the lowest decile. Driving the expansion of CTs was their widely acclaimed record of positive results. Evidence from across the world confirmed that well targeted, well designed social transfer programmes were an effective and affordable instrument for reducing the incidence and intensity of household poverty with measureable improvements in child health and educational attendance (Arnold et al., ; Cecchini & Madariaga, ; Fiszbein et al., ; Soares, Soares, Medeiros, & Guerreiro Os\u00f3rio, ). One commentator, echoing a commonly expressed view, went as far as to state that they were \u2018as close as you can come to a magic bullet in development\u2019.",
              "The articles in the first section of the Special Issue find that CTPs have largely positive outcomes including enhanced self esteem at the individual level, as well as enabling greater participation in social interaction. However in some cases there can be negative side effects of being part of the programme such as feelings of humiliation, stigma and shame due to reliance on the transfer for support. The article by Samuels and Stavropoulou discusses findings from the Transforming Cash Transfers project in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East; that by Attah et al. draws on evaluations of CTPs in east, west and southern Africa, while Adato et al. focus on a South African case study. There is evidence in all three articles of the effects of cash transfer programmes on psychosocial health and behaviour. Both Attah et al. and Samuels and Stavropoulou look at how psychosocial wellbeing affects both individuals and their relation to others. Attah et al. present findings from a mixed method evaluation of a cash transfer in Kenya, and from cross-country qualitative research from Ghana, Zimbabwe and Lesotho. They pay particular attention to the intrinsic and instrumental dimensions of psychosocial wellbeing showing that cash transfers can have positive impacts on psychosocial wellbeing leading to further positive impacts on educational performance, participation in social life and empowerment for decision-making."

              "Research has shown that poverty experienced during early childhood is associated with worse child, youth, and adult outcomes. Aspects of development affected by poverty early in life include learning, educational attainment, physical and mental health, and adult earnings. The negative effects of poverty may be particularly strong when it is experienced during early childhood, relative to later in childhood and in adolescence. Developmental theory suggests that family processes play an important role in explaining associations between income poverty and children\u2019s outcomes. However, the extent to which income support and anti-poverty initiatives causally affect family processes among families with low incomes is not well understood.\nMany longitudinal, non-experimental studies have established the cascading effects of economic hardship and low income, which contribute to parental psychological distress and reduce the quality of family relationships, parenting, and child outcomes. The goal of this randomized controlled study is to examine the extent to which a multi-year cash transfer program\u2014which provides an ~$4000 annual unconditional cash transfer, distributed monthly as a cash gift on a debit card to participants who had given birth (henceforth, mothers) and had prior-year household income below the federal poverty threshold\u2014affects economic hardship, maternal well-being, family relationships, and parenting across the first three years of life.",
              "Most conditional and unconditional cash transfer programs have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Experimental evaluations of these programs typically include some measures of economic well-being as well as physical and mental health, but few include measures of family processes. Systematic reviews of these international studies find that, on average, cash transfer programs improve food security and indicators of economic well-being as well as mental health. A recent meta-analysis of 45 conditional and unconditional cash transfer evaluations conducted in low- and middle-income countries found average effect sizes of +0.13 on adult subjective well-being and \u22120.07 on mental health problems (primarily depressive symptoms). In addition, most cash transfer programs either reduce intimate partner violence or do not affect it at all. Baranov et al.\u2019s meta-analysis found that cash transfer programs reduce intimate partner violence by 2\u20134% depending on the type of violence measured.",
              "However, systematic reviews suggest considerable heterogeneity in the estimated impacts of cash transfer programs on parent and child well-being, both across and within studies. McGuire et al.\u2019s meta-analysis found that unconditional cash transfers had larger impacts than conditional ones, and that impacts declined over time after the payments ended. Yet not all results are consistent\u2014an evaluation of a unconditional cash transfer program in Ecuador found that monthly cash transfers amounting to 10% of household income improved young children\u2019s development among families with the lowest incomes, but generated null to negative effects on maternal mental health among those same families. The same cash transfer in Ecuador reduced emotional violence in households for mothers with higher educational attainment, but not for mothers with lower educational attainment. Among mothers with lower educational attainment, if the mother\u2019s educational attainment was higher than her partner\u2019s, the cash transfer appeared to increase emotional violence."

              "#  Improving Lives Through Cash Transfers \nA cash transfer is a payment of money to a recipient, either as a one-time or a repeat payment. In humanitarian contexts, cash transfers are often used to alleviate poverty and provide assistance in emergencies and in economic development. Evidence demonstrates that cash transfer programs, growing around the globe since the mid-1990s, are a cost-effective way to improve the lives of poor households across many domains.\nThese programs can impact a wide range of development outcomes because recipients purchase food, invest in agriculture, improve their shelter, and pay for medical and education expenses. Cash transfers address poor households\u2019 severe budget constraints and investment needs ranging across education, health, household, and business.\n_Read about our work in:_\nCash transfer programs come in many designs that vary by conditionality, targeted population, size of grant, frequency of grant, and length of the program. They are one of the most studied development programs today with much evidence demonstrating their success, yet there remain questions about how variations in programs can affect their impact. Does adding resources or services to the cash transfers maximize their benefits? How can they be adapted for use in refugee camps or with migrant populations? \nAIR\u2019s extensive expertise in evaluating cash transfers provides a unique ability to assess commonalities and differences across cash transfer programs. AIR took this opportunity to synthesize findings across studies to identify lessons for designing cash transfer programming.\nWhile impact evaluations are an essential component for creating a rigorous evidence base on the effectiveness of cash transfer programs, mixed-methods evaluations of program design and implementation fidelity are critical to understand how cash transfer programs work.",
              "This program aims to reduce child poverty, improve child well-being, and promote access to basic services for families. It has three components: a regular cash transfer, distributed to the primary caregiver of children ages 0-2; a social behavior change communication package around positive nutrition and hygiene practices; and family support services for the most vulnerable program participants. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) Mozambique hired AIR and its partners to conduct a 24-month, longitudinal impact evaluation and process evaluation of this program\u2019s start-up phase.\nBased on the evidence that AIR generated, the Government of Mozambique decided to expand the \"cash and care\" model, aiming to reach 500,000 children for the period from 2022 to 2026 in 10 provinces. The expansion plan aims to cover approximately 20 percent of the children aged 0-2. \nAlthough the number of refugee children enrolled in school in Turkey has increased significantly in recent years, a number of obstacles mean nearly 40 percent of Syrian children living in Turkey remain out of school. UNICEF Turkey contracted with AIR to conduct a rigorous program evaluation of the Conditional Cash Transfer for Education for Syrians and Other Refugees, which provides bimonthly cash payments to eligible households and targeted support in the form of child protection outreach visits to households with children deemed to be most at risk. \nThe relationship between happiness and income is at the center of a vibrant debate, as emotional states are an important determinant of health and social behavior. This journal article discusses whether a government-run unconditional cash transfer paid directly to women in poor households had an impact on self-reported happiness.\n### Cash Transfers Explained: How Cash Empowers Poor Families in Zambia (Video)"

              "Cash transfer programs have emerged as potent tools for alleviating poverty and enhancing the living conditions of the most deprived households in developing nations. Such initiatives have now become integral components of social protection systems in many developing countries, including Pakistan. Evaluating the efficacy of these safety nets is crucial to comprehend their value in terms of public expenditure. This research employed a well-being index to gauge the impact of unconditional cash transfers on the socioeconomics of recipients. By employing three rounds of the BISP impact assessment survey conducted in 2011, 2016, and 2019. The study measured the overall impact of cash transfers on well-being by utilizing Principal Component Analysis in conjunction with a Difference-in-Differences Quasi-Experimental design over the years. The findings of the study indicate that between 2011 and 2016, the socioeconomic status declined for both treatment and control groups, but the reduction was less pronounced among those who received treatment compared to the control group with insignificant. From 2016 to 2019, there was a marginal positive increase in socioeconomic status, although it was of insignificance. Overall, the well-being of both the control and treatment groups decreased from 2011 to 2019, with a slightly more pronounced improvement observed in the treatment group. This trend suggests that the impact of the BISP unconditional cash transfer program had a limited effect on altering the well-being of the beneficiaries. The lack of substantial impact from the BISP\u2019s cash transfers on household well-being can be attributed to factors such as inflation, unemployment, economic slowdown, payment challenges, insufficient funding, and gaps between installments. The government of Pakistan should reconsider the substantial investment in BISP within the context of value for money",
              "### Similar content being viewed by others\nCash transfers have emerged as a powerful tool in reducing poverty and improving the wellbeing of the poorest households in developing countries (Baird et al. ). These transfers provide direct monetary assistance to low-income families with the primary objective of improving their income and increasing their consumption of essential commodities (Handa and Davis ). According to recent estimates, cash transfers have already benefitted approximately 718 million people in developing countries, with the numbers expected to rise in the coming years (De Groot et al. ).\nIn the short term, these transfers can provide resources that families can use to meet immediate needs like food and shelter, while in the long term, they can enable families to invest in education, health, and other productive activities to break out of the poverty cycle (Ayoo ). Cash transfers can also empower women, improve school attendance, and contribute to better nutrition and health outcomes, particularly in patriarchal societies where women have limited access to resources and decision-making (Sugiyama and Hunter ).\nCash transfer schemes are now an integral part of the social protection systems of many developing countries due to poverty and social well-being being significant obstacles to sustainable development. Education, health, and women\u2019s empowerment are particularly critical areas that need to be addressed (De Groot et al. ). Despite progress made over the past few decades, the challenges remain substantial. For instance, although more than one billion individuals were lifted out of extreme poverty between 1990 and 2011, 258 million children and youth worldwide are still out of school. Moreover, 828 million people in 2021 do not have sufficient food to eat (UNICEF ; WFP and UNICEF ).",
              "Additionally, this research investigates the differential impact of socioeconomic and cash transfers on household and beneficiaries\u2019 characteristics. The findings of this research are crucial for informing evidence-based policy analysis to scale up contributions to cash transfer programs. This is particularly relevant in the context of national government commitments to improving value for money, expanding coverage, ensuring financial sustainability, clarifying the level and type of impact, and adequately reflecting these in social wellbeing. Moreover, this research aims to take a strategic approach to providing technical assistance on national cash transfer systems, in line with the government\u2019s commitment to reducing poverty, improving health, education, and empowering women.\nIn the world, across 72 to 149 Social Safety Nets (SSN)/Social Assistance (SA) programs have been launched in various developing and developed nations to alleviate poverty, increase well-being, social development, and safeguard against economic shocks (Saleem and World Bank ). In developing nations, tailored interventions have long been used to reduce poverty and promote social well-being. Ivaschenko et al. () investigate trends in SSN programme coverage, spending, and programme performance throughout the world and find evidence of an increasing commitment to SSN/SA programmes, emphasizing their substantial contribution to poverty reduction efforts. However, they also stress the continuous difficulty of low programme coverage and benefits, implying that while these programmes have made achievements, more effort is needed to achieve meaningful poverty reduction."

              "The social safety net\u2019s disjointedness and complexity require needy families to interact multiple times with government agencies to access benefits. Some complexity is necessary to ensure only eligible families receive assistance. However, the myriad possible program and service combinations create a bureaucratic web that government officials and benefit recipients must navigate.\nThe largest share of safety-net spending goes to means-tested health insurance programs, including Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. According to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, total Medicaid spending in fiscal year (FY) 2020 topped $649 billion, of which the federal government supported 67 percent, and the program covered approximately 76 million individuals. Medicaid overshadows other safety-net spending and deserves its own reforms (covered in Chapter 5 of this volume).\nThe remaining major means-tested safety-net programs (including refundable credits paid under the EITC and CTC) cost taxpayers over $300 billion annually in just federal outlays, as Table 1 illustrates. Excluding health care, the largest programs in terms of recipients and dollars cover four areas: income support, food and nutrition assistance, childcare, and housing and energy assistance. Table 1 briefly describes major programs and their 2019 costs before significant increases related to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTable 1. Description and Recent Federal Cost of Major Means-Tested Safety-Net Programs\nEarned Income Tax Credit (EITC) | \n  * The EITC provides at tax time a lump-sum benefit of up to about $6,700, depending on household income and family size, including to those without federal income tax liability. \n  * The EITC phases in at different rates depending on family size, starting with the first dollar earned and increasing as earnings rise.",
              "| Program expenditures were $32.0 billion.   \nHousing (Housing Choice Vouchers and Public Housing)  | \n  * Programs provide two types of assistance: tenant-based assistance such as vouchers to eligible families used for housing costs and project-based assistance such as apartments in public housing.\n  * Programs are administered by state housing authorities.\n  * Voucher amounts vary by state and follow fair market rent guidelines. Public housing assigns apartments to eligible recipients. Both programs generally require families to contribute 30 percent of income toward housing costs.\n  * Funding is limited, and not all eligible families receive assistance.\n\n| Program expenditures were $29.9 billion.   \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)  | \n  * LIHEAP assists low-income families with heating and electricity costs.\n  * It is administered by the states.\n  * Income eligibility varies by state, but household income must be below 150 percent of the federal poverty threshold, with categorical eligibility provided through TANF, SNAP, and SSI.\n  * Benefit amounts vary widely by state. \n\n| Program expenditures were $3.6 billion.   \nChild Care and Development Fund, which includes funding through the Child Care and Development Block Grant, also known as the Child Care Subsidy Program | \n  * The fund provides vouchers to eligible low- and moderate-income families to cover childcare costs, with some assistance through direct childcare \u201cslots.\u201d\n  * States generally pay childcare providers directly. Base rates vary by state, with a median of approximately $780 per month for toddlers in 2019 (the most recent available data). \n  * Income eligibility varies by state, but household income must be below 85 percent of the state median income.\n  * Funding is limited, and not all eligible families receive assistance.\n  * Families with income above the federal poverty level generally have a co-payment.",

              "For medical services used by most Medicaid enrollees\u2014those who were not made eligible by the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\u2014the share of Medicaid costs paid by the federal government is specified by the federal medical assistance percentage rate (FMAP rate). The FMAP rate is determined by a formula that provides a higher rate of federal reimbursement for states with lower per capita income relative to the national average and a lower rate for higher-income states. By law, a state's FMAP rate can be no less than 50 percent and no more than 83 percent. The national average matching rate over the 2024\u20132032 period for services provided to those enrollees is projected to be 60 percent, with states contributing the remaining 40 percent. In 2021, federal spending governed by the FMAP formula was $397 billion, or about 75 percent of total federal Medicaid spending. Federal spending for states with FMAP rates set at the 50 percent floor accounted for 38 percent of that amount.",
              "The federal government's share of costs for medical services is considerably larger for enrollees who became eligible for Medicaid because of the optional expansion of eligibility under the ACA. That law allowed states to expand eligibility to all adults under age 65 (including parents and adults without dependent children) who have income below 138 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. (Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have adopted the expansion.) For those who are eligible as a result, the federal government's share of Medicaid costs is fixed at 90 percent and does not vary by state. That higher matching rate was made available\u2014even though those enrollees' health risks are typically lower than the health risks of some other eligible groups, such as the elderly and disabled\u2014in order to lower the financial cost to states of covering a group that had not generally been covered previously. In 2021, federal spending for services provided to those newly eligible enrollees was $99 billion, or about 20 percent of total federal Medicaid spending.",
              "The federal government's share of administrative expenses is also specified by statute and varies by the category of such costs, but not by state. The federal government's share of general administrative expenses is 50 percent; however, for 25 specified categories of administrative costs, the federal share ranges from about 70 percent to 100 percent. For example, the federal government pays 75 percent of the cost of employing skilled medical professionals for Medicaid administration, 75 percent of the cost of utilization review (the process of determining the appropriateness and medical necessity of various health care services), 90 percent of the cost of developing systems to manage claims and information, and 100 percent of the cost of prescription-drug monitoring programs. The overall average federal share for administrative expenses was 62 percent in 2021. That year, federal spending for Medicaid administration was $20 billion, or about 5 percent of total federal Medicaid spending.\nThis option consists of three alternatives, each of which would go into effect in October 2023.\n  * Under the first alternative, the federal government's share for all categories of administrative spending would be 50 percent.\n  * Under the second alternative, the 50 percent floor on the FMAP rate that applies to medical services for enrollees not made eligible by the ACA would be removed. Consequently, FMAP rates would fall below 50 percent for states with the highest per capita income. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this alternative would affect 13 states, and the new matching rates for those states would be between 4 percent and 49.75 percent.\n  * Under the third alternative, the federal share of medical expenditures for enrollees made eligible by the ACA would be based on the same FMAP formula that applies to all other enrollees."

              "# Eliminating the Medicaid Expansion Federal Match Rate: State-by-State Estimates\nThere are under consideration in Congress to significantly to help pay for an extension of expiring tax cuts. Medicaid is the primary program providing comprehensive health and long-term care to people living in the U.S. and accounts for nearly [$1 out of every $5](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-the-basics/) spent on health care. Medicaid is administered by states within broad federal rules and jointly funded by states and the federal government, meaning restrictions in federal Medicaid spending could leave states with about how to offset reductions. This analysis examines the potential impacts on states and Medicaid enrollees of one prominent proposal, which would eliminate the 90% federal match rate for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion, which currently covers over 20 million people. Key takeaways include:\n  * This analysis explores the impact of eliminating the ACA expansion match rate under two scenarios. The first assumes that states maintain Medicaid expansion coverage and pick up new expansion costs, resulting in a decrease of 10% (or $626 billion) in federal Medicaid spending and an increase of 17% (or $626 billion) in state Medicaid spending across all states over a 10-year period.\n  * The second scenario assumes that states drop the ACA Medicaid expansion in response to the elimination of the 90% federal match rate. This would result in a 25% (or $1.7 trillion) decrease in federal Medicaid spending and a 5% (or $186 billion) decrease in state Medicaid spending across all states over a 10-year period. This would also cut total Medicaid spending by nearly one-fifth (or $1.9 trillion), and nearly a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees (20 million people) would lose coverage.\n  * Only states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion would see any spending or enrollment impacts under this policy proposal, though changes vary by state.",
              "## What is the proposed policy change?\nStates that have implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion currently receive a 90%[federal match rate or \u201cFMAP\u201d](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-the-basics/)for adults covered through the expansion, meaning the federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion enrollees. The ACA expanded Medicaid coverage to nearly all adults with incomes up to 138% of the ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). However, a effectively made the decision to implement the Medicaid expansion an option for states. (including DC) have since adopted Medicaid expansion, and Medicaid expansion enrollees nearly a quarter of Medicaid enrollment (as of March 2024) and one-fifth of total Medicaid spending (as of FY 2023). The FMAP for services used by people eligible through traditional Medicaid is determined by a formula set in statute. The formula is designed so that the federal government provides a match rate of at least 50% and provides a higher match rate for states with lower average per capita income. For FY 2026, the traditional from 50% to 77%.\nThis analysis estimates the impact of eliminating the enhanced FMAP for adults in the Medicaid expansion. The analysis assumes that, starting in FY 2026, expenditures for people eligible in the Medicaid expansion would be matched at each state\u2019s traditional 2026 FMAP rate. Details regarding the design of this policy change have yet to be released, and the details of proposed legislation may differ from the assumptions made to complete this analysis. This is also only one of the various Medicaid policy changes that have been suggested and estimates would change if multiple policies were considered together.\n## What are the potential impacts on Medicaid spending and enrollment?",
              "This analysis does not make assumptions about specific state behavioral responses and instead examines the impact of eliminating the ACA expansion match rate under two scenarios. These scenarios are designed to illustrate the range of potential policy change effects; in practice, each state may respond to the policy change differently. While some states may choose to continue ACA Medicaid expansion coverage with substantially reduced federal funding, many likely would not given the extra spending that would be required. The analysis also excludes secondary effects such as people who lose coverage through the Medicaid expansion enrolling in Medicaid under other eligibility pathways or enrolling in private health coverage. The estimates presented here are not directly comparable to the from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) because CBO\u2019s estimates account for assumptions about state behavioral responses and other secondary effects.\n  * All expansion states pick up new expansion costs. Expansion enrollment and total spending would remain constant while costs shift from the federal government to the states.\n  * All states drop the ACA Medicaid expansion, resulting in changes to enrollment as well as total, federal, and state spending."

              "How does Medicaid expansion generate savings to offset such costs? Medicaid expansion allows states to access an enhanced federal match for some people who would otherwise be covered by traditional Medicaid (). Given that states pay between 25 percent and 50 percent of the cost for a traditional Medicaid beneficiary but only 10 percent of the cost for an expansion beneficiary, these savings can be substantial. States can save from 15 cents to 40 cents on every dollar of care it can shift to expansion (assuming 2020 expansion match rates).\nPrior research identifies several types of expansion beneficiaries who would likely receive traditional Medicaid in the absence of expansion. Some are people who would have been covered through specific Medicaid programs, such as Section 1115 waivers or the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program. Some are people who used to spend down assets or pursue a disability designation to qualify for Medicaid that now qualify for expansion. The populations affected vary from state to state, depending on the specifics of their traditional Medicaid programs.\nWhile researchers have a clear understanding of how expansion may reduce states\u2019 traditional Medicaid spending, calculating the magnitude of these savings is difficult. In expansion states, we only observe what happened with expansion \u2014 not what these states would have spent had they not expanded Medicaid."

              "Under the \u2019s 90 percent federal reimbursement percentage, $100 of financing gimmicks yields $900 in federal funds for the state. Under the average state\u2019s 60 percent federal reimbursement for traditional Medicaid recipients, $100 of financing gimmicks yields $150 in federal funds for the state. Money laundering for spending on the expansion population thus has a rate of return six times higher for the average state\u2014and more so for wealthier states that receive lower federal reimbursements for traditional recipients.\nThe federal government\u2019s near-total subsidization of the expansion group dramatically weakens states\u2019 incentives to enforce eligibility rules. When ineligible individuals receive benefits through the expansion group, states bear almost none of the cost. On the other hand, ineligible enrollment in Medicaid allows governors and state legislators to boast of reducing the uninsured rate, expanding health coverage for their constituents, and supporting local hospitals and insurers offering Medicaid plans. In essence, state policymakers reap the political benefits of allowing large numbers of ineligible enrollees in Medicaid while federal taxpayers foot the bill.\nDifferences in federal matching rates also create strong financial motives for states to classify individuals eligible for Medicaid under traditional pathways as expansion enrollees. For example, if the annual cost for a Medicaid enrollee is $10,000, states save $3,000 per year by placing them in the expansion group with a 90 percent federal match, compared to the 60 percent match for the traditional group. Research suggests that these types of reclassifications may be widespread, affecting millions of enrollees and substantially inflating federal spending on ."

              "As the foregoing suggests, strong matching requirements are the exception rather than the rule in federal grant programs. In fact, strong matching requirements present a tradeoff to federal policy-making officials. Many grants have the objective of providing a minimum floor of services across the nation and across all states or localities. From this perspective, strong matching requirements\u2014although prompting greater deliberation and oversight by state and local officials\u2014may also serve to discourage participation by these governments, thereby frustrating the provision of uniform minimum services throughout the country. The impacts of matching on grant participation can be particularly severe for fiscally hard-pressed entities for whom raising the nonfederal share constitutes a greater burden than for wealthier jurisdictions. Federal policy makers can adjust matching rates to reflect the differential fiscal capacity across the nation by varying the matching formula or by waiving matching for certain governments. Indeed, the federal Medicaid program allocates federal funds through a matching formula that provides a higher federal share to states with lower per capita incomes, as a proxy for fiscal capacity. However, for most programs, the matching rate is either lowered or eliminated, recognizing the importance that federal policy makers place on ensuring maximum participation in grant programs."

              "The next sections will provide an overview of specific challenges behavioral health practitioners and organizations may face when utilizing an EBP that are related to implementation practice. It will also provide recommendations for future research efforts, to be informed by key stakeholders, aimed at developing implementation practice capacity to improve the implementation of EBPs and client outcomes.\n##  Issues for Consideration in Implementation Practice\n### Challenges to implementation of evidence-based practices\nAlthough the promotion of EBPs in health services represented a critical advancement in behavioral health care, the well-intentioned push towards the use of EBPs often fails to close the gap between the best available research and practice. EBPs must be effectively matched to community needs, implemented with fidelity to the standards of the intervention, and integrated within regular practices, so they may be sustained over time to ensure better outcomes for consumers. An organization adopting an EBP without first considering implementation and its associated barriers may not be able to ensure effective outcomes among clients. To achieve positive outcomes, EBPs must not simply be implemented but implemented with quality. However, behavioral health organizations and practitioners face significant challenges to successful implementation. These include the following: (1) being able to access and understand research findings and interpret them for the needs of their clients, agency, and community; (2) being able to identify and select EBPs they can afford; (3) being able to do the actual work of implementing the EBP through staff training, instituting new policies, and negotiating new contracts; and (4) integrating these changes so these efforts can be sustained.",
              "Practitioners may also have difficulties in matching EBPs that are often developed with very narrow and specific populations, with their more diverse clientele. Those they serve may suffer from multiple, complex issues bridging mental and physical health concerns, historic disparities and discrimination, poverty, mobility, and education. A topic that has caused tension in the research community is the discussion of fidelity and adaption. While many argue that adaptations are necessary to meet the needs of a specific setting, others postulate that an EBP that has been adapted may compromise the core elements of the program and be less effective when compared to the original program. Although fidelity has become the \u201cgold standard\u201d for successful program implementation, it may not take into consideration how a program fits within a context. In addition, organizational characteristics such as readiness for change, climate, staffing, leadership, and funding can significantly impact the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of EBPs. Sustainability may require long-term commitments to facilitate change, including the support of new policies, procedures, and infrastructure enhancements. Supporting implementation and sustainability may require new partnerships and collaborations, sufficient funding, and ongoing problem-solving. illustrates the core challenges of translating implementation science into implementation practice.\nCore Challenges of Translating Implementation Science into Implementation Practice",
              "A significant amount of IS research is often conducted with limited collaboration or input from key stakeholders (i.e., clients, practitioners, and service organizations). This may result in an implementation strategy that does not take real-world barriers into consideration, that may be used incorrectly, and/or that is unable to be replicated. In order to develop tangible, applicable, and sustainable strategies for capacity building among practitioners and service organizations in implementation practice, it is essential that the strategies are created and tested in collaboration with the key stakeholders intended for its use.\nGiven these challenges and the lack of opportunity for formal training related to EBPs and IS, strategies are needed to build practice level capacity in service organizations for identifying, adopting, implementing, and sustaining EBPs. To influence professional practice, practitioners and service organizations must know how to (1) choose between competing theories, frameworks, models, and strategies of implementation; (2) must be able to determine which issues are most central to consider for their agency; (3) assess fit for their population; (4) acquire and/or allocated resources; (5) determine which approach(es) have the highest potential to produce successful implementation in their unique service setting; and (6) marshal resources to ensure continuation and continuity of the supports necessary for sustainability.\nThis capacity must address the organization\u2019s ability to adjust and account for changes at systems levels, within Federal and state regulations and licensing and funding requirements; at organizational levels, including considering the organization of programs, the structure of the organization, and its relation to other practitioners; and within the consumer community\u2014by building tolerance, trust, and acknowledging the expectations of consumers (see )."

              "Implementation of EBPs in poor school district settings poses a unique set of challenges. Under-resourced schools often utilize mental health teams comprising both school district and community mental health agency employees ([Markle, Splett, Maras, & Weston, 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4553241/#R53)). The use of multiple providers from different organizational contexts may lead to a fragmented system of care where goals may not be in alignment, and it is unclear who is responsible for presenting problems that traverse both academic and behavioral domains. With the fiscal challenges that poorer school districts face each year, staff is often extremely limited and competing priorities may exacerbate available staff shortage for implementation in these settings (). Support staff and other personnel often are not trained mental health providers, but given staff limitations, they may be responsible for implementation and may not see that as their role or priority ([Benjamin, Taylor, Goodin, & Creed, 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4553241/#R14)).",
              "Many school systems face significant reductions in public funds (; ) that significantly impact the ability to dedicate upfront resources for intervention materials, space, staff training and professional development. Structural and practical issues may be important to consider as well. For instance, shorter school class periods may hinder mental health teams attempts to follow an intervention manual that was initially developed for 60-minute outpatient sessions (e.g., ).\nBarriers to sustainment may arise in the (a) development of principal and other administrator support; (b) alignment of the intervention with school philosophy, goals, policies, and programs; (c) visibility of program outcomes to key stakeholders; and (d) development of support systems for implementers ().",
              "Schools in under-resourced school districts may be the focus of multiple new initiatives that often become fragmented and work at cross-purposes ([Ahram, Stembridge, Fergus, & Noguera, 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4553241/#R4)). This can affect implementation and sustainment of academic and non-academic best practices and contribute to negative attitudes toward the implementation of new initiatives, such as those related to the implementation of mental health EBPs (). This can be especially challenging when competing systems-level stakeholders are present, which may create a climate that is not conducive to long-term initiatives.\nFor example, as previously discussed, in one common school-based mental health approach schools contract with community behavioral health agencies to provide mental health teams to deliver services in the school setting (i.e., co-location; ). This is the approach implemented in most large US cities and in poor rural and suburban school districts. In the co-location approach, it is important to consider that agency leadership may vary in their support of EBP and their level of support often influences the resources and support available to mental health teams being asked to participate in EBP implementation. Community agencies may differ with school administrators on methodology of care, and negotiating these differences can be challenging."

              "Factors operating at the organizational domain (i.e., associated with the entity implementing the task-sharing intervention) were identified primarily as barriers. Studies cited several limited clinical resources as impeding implementation. From the clients\u2019 perspective, understaffed clinics had long waiting times and limited scheduling which reduced engagement, particularly for clients whose socioeconomic situation had constrained their availability to attend appointments. From the providers\u2019 perspective, providers in such clinics needed to manage large caseloads which may potentially lead to burnout or decreased quality of care. Physical space constraints in health clinics also posed a major barrier, such as limiting the ease of achieving privacy for private counseling sessions with users. The absence of these resources constrained effective, sustained client participation by limiting the frequency of appointments or by making clients more reluctant to meaningfully disclose concerns or conditions due to a lack of privacy.\nImplementation climate factors such as collaboration with other entities or healthcare workers on the ground in the delivery of interventions were found to be more successful. For instance, existing networks between providers facilitated referrals from task-sharing workers to specialists and other care providers [], but a relative lack of these types of networks made implementation more difficult []."

              "If outcomes are unsatisfactory and fidelity is low, then the first approach is to improve or modify implementation supports (e.g., more targeted staff recruitment and selection, increased skill-based training, and frequency and type of coaching) in order to improve fidelity (Webster-Stratton, Reinke, Herman, & Newcomer, in press). Or it may be necessary to review the organizational factors (e.g., time allocated for coaching, access to equipment needed for the intervention) and systemic constraints (e.g., licensure requirements that limit recruitment, billing constraints, inappropriate referrals) that may be making it difficult to achieve high fidelity. Making changes to address organizational and/or systems issues (e.g., funding, licensure, billing) often require considerable time and effort. Therefore, the implementation supports of selection, training, and coaching may need to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccompensate' for the organizational and systems barriers (Fixsen et al., 2005). For example, it may take time to address the funding constraints that make it difficult to fund coaching of staff. While attempts to fund the coaching are being pursued, it may be necessary to use more rigorous selection criteria to recruit more experienced staff or provide increased training to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccompensate' for the impact of funding on the provision of coaching.\nIn summary, this table brings home the point that both knowledge and measurement of the presence and strength of the core components (e.g., through fidelity and other measures), are required to interpret and respond to outcome data."

The most expensive failures stem from treating implementation as a one-time technical project rather than an ongoing organizational transformation requiring careful change management and continuous improvement.\n###  Which of the following has been a challenge during the implementation of EHRs?\nMajor challenges during EHR implementation include inadequate needs assessment, budget underestimation, insufficient staff training, poor data migration, workflow disruption, and security compliance issues. Behavioral health organizations particularly struggle with systems that don\u2019t accommodate their specialized documentation requirements and privacy regulations.\n###  What did hospitals do wrong when introducing electronic health records?\nHospitals often underestimated the complexity of by rushing needs assessments, failing to adequately train staff, and not properly optimizing clinical workflows. Many also neglected the critical change management aspects, leading to resistance from clinical staff and implementation of systems that increased rather than decreased documentation burden.",
              "Particularly challenging for behavioral health organizations is budgeting for specialized customizations needed to support mental health and substance use disorder treatment documentation.\nDevelop a comprehensive budget that accounts for:\n  * Total cost of ownership (TCO) across a 5-year horizon, not just initial implementation\n  * Realistic productivity impact during transition periods\n  * Staff time dedicated to implementation activities\n  * Ongoing training and support requirements\n  * Potential expansion costs as your organization grows\n\nOrganizations should establish a contingency fund of at least 20% beyond the anticipated budget to address unexpected challenges that inevitably arise during complex technology implementations.\n###  Mistake #3: Insufficient Staff Training and Support\nBehavioral health clinicians often face unique challenges in adapting to EHR systems. Many entered the field motivated by direct patient care, not technological proficiency, making comprehensive training absolutely essential for successful adoption.\nImplementation failures frequently stem from:\n  * One-size-fits-all training approaches that don\u2019t address role-specific needs\n  * Insufficient training hours (industry benchmarks suggest 8-12 hours minimum per user)\n  * Training schedules that don\u2019t accommodate clinical workloads\n  * Lack of ongoing support and refresher opportunities after go-live\n  * Failure to address psychological resistance to technology adoption"

However, the governor\u2019s proposal does not contain tax policy changes that would significantly increase state revenues to meet the level of needs existing in the state or to account for potential federal threats to vital public supports that could harm California residents as well as the state\u2019s budget.\nDuring the 2024-25 budget process, facing a large budget shortfall, state leaders enacted a that included some tax policy changes to increase state revenue, but the majority of that revenue increase was related to temporary corporate tax benefit limitations set to expire by the 2026 tax year at the latest. Overall, revenue increases made up less than 1% of the budget solutions. \nNotably, the state loses tens of billions of dollars on corporate and personal income tax breaks each year. However, these costly tax breaks are not reevaluated in budget deliberations and many continue every year without scrutiny.

              "The U.S. campaign finance system unfairly favors a small handful of wealthy donors. Small donor public financing could fix that.\nThere is a growing disconnect between elected officials and the majority of people they represent. Part of the blame lies with a campaign finance system that unfairly stacks the deck in favor of the few donors able to give large contributions. d and other court rulings ended decades of commonsense campaign finance laws. Now a handful of wealthy special interests dominate political funding, often through super PACs and shadowy nonprofits that shield donors\u2019 identities.\nBrennan Center for Justice has pioneered the most effective and promising solution to the problem of big money in politics: small donor public financing, a system in which public funds [match and multiply small donations](https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/small-donor-public-financing-ny). New York City\u2019s multiple match system, in which a $50 donation generates a total of $350 for the candidate, has helped reduce the influence of special interests and empower average voters, and the idea is gaining traction across the country. \nIt\u2019s easy to see why. Small donor public financing incentivizes candidates to seek out many supporters, not just a few big donors. It enables more candidates from diverse backgrounds to run and it amplifies the voices of regular people. Designed right, small donor public financing also permits candidates to raise and spend what they need to compete in the super PAC era, should they choose to opt in. And, because it doesn\u2019t restrict political spending, it stands up to the current Supreme Court\u2019s requirements. \nOther approaches to public campaign financing include voucher systems, where citizens receive certain amounts in public funds they can direct to their preferred candidates.

GAO was asked to inventory examples of alternative \napproaches that agencies have employed to finance the capital used in \ntheir operations.\n\nWhat GAO Found:\n\nCapital projects are fully funded when Congress provides budget \nauthority for the full cost of an asset up front. Such up-front \nfunding provides recognition for commitments that are embodied in \nbudgetary decisions and maintains governmentwide fiscal control. \nHowever, providing budget authority for the large up-front costs of \ncapital assets creates challenges in an era of resource constraints. \nAgencies have been authorized to use an array of approaches to obtain \ncapital assets without full, up-front budget authority. Our work \nidentified 10 alternative financing approaches used by one or more of \n13 agencies. These approaches, which are described in our letter, \n\n* incremental funding,\n* operating leases,\n* retained fees,\n* real property swaps, \n* sale-leasebacks,\n* lease-leasebacks,\n* public private partnerships,\n* outleases,\n* share-in-savings contracts, and\n* debt issuance.",

From an agency's \nperspective, meeting capital needs through alternative financing \napproaches (i.e., not full funding) can be very attractive because the \nagency can obtain the capital asset without first having to secure \nsufficient appropriations to cover the full cost of the asset. \nDepending on the financing approach, an agency may spread the asset \ncost over a number of years or may never even incur a monetary cost \nthat is recognized in the budget. In other words, alternative financing \napproaches can make it easier for agencies to meet mission capital \ndemands within the constraints of their appropriation. As we have \nreported in the past, however, from a governmentwide perspective the \ncosts associated with these financing approaches may be greater than \nwith full, up-front budget authority. Regardless of the financing \napproach used to obtain the capital, agencies would receive the same \nprogram benefits.\n\nTable 1 below shows an array of approaches that agencies have used to \nfinance capital.\n\nTable 1: Alternative Financing Approaches:\n\nAgency: GSA; \nIncremental funding: None; \nOperating lease: PTO building; DOT headquarters; \nRetained fees: Phillip Burton Conf.

              "Community coalitions have increasingly been used as a vehicle to foster improvements in community health. A coalition is traditionally defined as \u201ca group of individuals representing diverse organizations, factions or constituencies who agree to work together to achieve a common goal\u201d (Feighery & Rogers, 1990). Community coalitions differ from other types of coalitions in that they include professional and grassroots members that are committed to working together to influence long-term health and welfare practices in their community (Butterfoss, 2007). Additionally, given their ability to leverage existing resources in the community and convene diverse organizations, community coalitions connote a type of collaboration that is considered to be sustainable over time (Butterfoss, Goodman, & Wandersman, 1993).\nFunders of community coalitions include governmental and non-governmental entities. The federal government often provides short-term initial funding to community coalitions to work toward important health goals that cannot be achieved by a single community organization. Foundations also frequently fund community coalitions and other collaborative partnerships to address key social issues. The presumption is that successful community coalitions will be able to identify new resources to continue their activities and to sustain their impacts in the community over time. Understanding the extent to which coalitions can be sustained post-funding will be important as the federal government continues to invest in innovative community-based strategies to improve the health outcomes of Americans.\n###  B. Purpose and Research Questions",
              "In addition, this literature review will serve as the foundation for developing a framework that may be used to assess the sustainability of community coalitions in the future. The conceptual framework will guide the ASPE study, which uses the experiences of the community coalitions funded by the Community Access Program (CAP)/Healthy Communities Access Program (HCAP) to explore sustainability.\nOne of the largest federal investments to strengthen local health care safety nets through community coalitions was the Community Access Program (CAP) and its successor, the Healthy Communities Access Program (HCAP). From 2000 through 2005, HCAP provided grants to local communities to strengthen the health care safety net that serves the uninsured and underinsured. Congressional funding for CAP began with a $25 million appropriation in the fiscal year (FY) 2000 budget that was used to make grants to 23 coalitions of community organizations and safety net providers. Additional funding provided to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for the program included approximately $500 million from FY 2001 through FY 2005. In total, HRSA awarded 260 grants in 45 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Funding for the program was ended in FY 2006.",
              "One of the ways in which CAP/HCAP distinguished itself from other federal safety net programs was by requiring collaboration. Namely, grants were given to consortia of local providers, rather than individual institutions. The program sought to overcome the fragmented nature of safety net care by bringing together the major players of a community and providing funds to address problems that could not be adequately addressed by individual providers or organizations. The CAP/HCAP-funded coalitions focused on activities such as service integration, expansion of the delivery system, cultural competency, provider education, community and patient education, disease detection and prevention, service integration, and new coverage plans for the uninsured, among others. \nUnderstanding the sustainability of community coalitions is particularly important today given new federal investments in clinical and community-based strategies through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. For example, $373 million of ARRA money will fund community consortia to address the leading causes of preventable death and disability under the Communities Putting Prevention to Work initiative. A more complete understanding of the factors that impede and facilitate coalition sustainability will assist successful coalitions to continue this important work after their initial federal funding ends. \nAn extensive review of the literature in the fields of public health and social sciences (particularly sociology, community psychology, and political science) was conducted in order to identify peer-reviewed articles, reports, and white papers. Boolean search techniques were utilized to conduct these searches\u2014maximizing the number of pertinent articles and minimizing extraneous material. References from relevant papers were used to identify additional sources. Exhibit 1.1 briefly summarizes the literature search strategy."

              "Political organizations possess various characteristics, such as composition, resources, objectives, strategies, and activities, which influence their functions and impact within political or governing systems at different scales. For instance, with their formal organizational structures, political parties frequently clash in electoral politics, striving to change or maintain seats of power in government, usually spanning the geography of a country and operating in the macro-political system (or, as referred to it in this article, the macro-system) (). Due to their often outsider status and informal organizational structures, social movements instead typically engage in extra-political activities like civil disobedience and demonstrations. If these activities succeed, they can draw national attention to their cause, impacting the broader macro-system as well ().\nThis article focuses on another informally structured category of political organization, namely advocacy coalitions. These are the backbone of the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), a policy process theory that studies how actors forge alliances to engage in and steer conflicts over policy and administrative issues. A defining characteristic of advocacy coalitions is that they seek to influence policy change and implementation in policy subsystems\u2014i.e., policy-specific subsets of the macro-system ().\nWhile the ACF scholarship continues to evolve and advance, opportunities always exist for further innovations and refinements. In this study, we examine and link two aspects of advocacy coalitions that have so far remained understudied: first, their involvement and mobilization at two levels of collective action (i.e., the macro-system and policy subsystems), and second, the possibility of deep core beliefs acting as the unifying force among members."

              "The cumulative evidence tends to support the propositions of the textbook Advocacy Coalition Theory. For example, empirical evidence has supported the argument for two or more stable coalitions when differences in policy core beliefs might escalate into conflict, but not without nuances and exceptions. In their study of U.S. automotive pollution control over 26 years, Zafonte and Sabatier () analyzed legislative testimonies at congressional hearings to find two advocacy coalitions, one for strict and the other for weak standards. They also observed changes in coalition composition for both coalitions and the emergence of a third coalition (pursuing moderate standards) over time. However, they also found little support for the expectation that policy core beliefs would be more stable than secondary beliefs. For studies of advocacy coalitions over time, Zafonte and Sabatier's findings are not unusual with the identification of stable coalitions with some members leaving, defecting, or joining over an extended period, and mixed results in the relative stability of the ACF's different belief system levels.\nOther studies have explored the mechanisms of coalition stability. For example, studies have examined how the devil shift contributes to coalition stability. Kingiri () used multiple methods (e.g., interviews and documents) to examine the biosafety subsystem in Kenya and found that the devil shift contributed to sustaining an advocacy coalition and limiting learning between coalitions."

              "### 2.2. State-created coalition opportunities\nCoalitions may also be initiated by those within the state who are seeking to advantage low-income marginalized groups. State-led collaborative engagements with civil society are longstanding and substantive (Evans, ; Ostrom, ). Political parties have sought alliances with civil society to strengthen new approaches to longstanding political and governance challenges (Hickey & Sen, ; Houtzager & Moore, ). Turning to city examples, Guti\u00e9rrez et al. () analyse how non-aligned politicians have used these approaches to reduce urban violence in Colombia: \nThe \u2018miracles\u2019 cannot be understood without dealing with urban politics and in particular with the ability of innovative politicians to successfully create viable transformational coalitions within the city. [\u2026] By comparing the differing trajectories of Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn, on the one hand, and Cali, on the other, we can focus on how and why coalitions make a difference. (p. 3136)\nGaventa and McGee () argue that \u2018alliances between social actors and champions of change inside the state are critical to make policy change happen\u2019 (p. 24). But policy changes that favour low-income groups are tricky to secure and hard to maintain. Brazilian policy councils were initiated to provide \u2018institutionalised spaces mediating among civil society organizations, city dwellers and the state\u2019 and councils used the enhanced participatory processes under the 1998 constitution to improve inclusion (Pimentel Walker & Friendly, , p. 436). However, a study in the two cities of S\u00e3o Paulo and Niter\u00f3i highlights that, although the councils have acted very much as multi-stakeholder coalitions (in terms of the definition given above), and have helped to address poverty through regularizing informal neighbourhoods, they have been used by real estate interests to marginalize low-income groups and secure municipal support for private-sector inner-city redevelopment (Pimentel Walker & Friendly, ).",
              "The interest of urban social movements in coalitions appears well founded. Evidence suggests that civil society state coalitions may support reform, making cities more politically inclusive, with more equitable outcomes. Coalitions have the potential to encourage cross-class collaboration (McAdam et al., ; Nelson, ), and improve democratic governance (Gaventa & McGee, ; McAdam et al., ). Coalitions appear to be effective \u2013 at least in part \u2013 because they change elite positions and priorities through deepening their understanding (framing) of disadvantaged groups (McAdam et al., ), resulting in more favourable politics (even if they are seen as oppositional groups) (Iraz\u00e1bal, ; Mouffe, ; Ramirez et al., ; Stone, ).",
              "Coalitional politics is being used by multiple urban social movements \u2013 and agencies that support their work \u2013 to address the scale and nature of disadvantage in towns and cities of the Global South. To advance our understanding about how coalitions might form and function effectively, this paper introduces and analyses four diverse exemplars that illustrate the approaches used. We find that coalitions have the potential to improve the relational capital of disadvantaged residents, increasing the legitimacy of their claims, advancing their interests and leading to pro-poor reforms. Coalitions enhance existing political opportunities and potentially improve the political opportunity structure. However, context matters, particularly the nature and extent of local democracy, and coalitions must operate in a space that is circumscribed and contested.\n\u6539\u9769\u8054\u76df\u5bf9\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8d21\u732e: \u57ce\u5e02\u793e\u4f1a\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u6559\u8bad\u3002. \u591a\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u793e\u4f1a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u90a3\u4e9b\u652f\u6301\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u673a\u6784, \u6b63\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8054\u76df\u653f\u6cbb\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u57ce\u9547\u4e2d\u52a3\u52bf\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u672c\u8d28\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u52a0\u6df1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8054\u76df\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u4f5c\u5730\u7406\u89e3, \u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5e76\u4e14\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u793a\u4f8b, \u4ee5\u8bf4\u660e\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e, \u8054\u76df\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6539\u5584\u5f31\u52bf\u5c45\u6c11\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8d44\u672c, \u589e\u52a0\u5176\u8bc9\u6c42\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u6027, \u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u5229\u76ca, \u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u7a77\u4eba\u7684\u6539\u9769\u3002\u6b64\u5916, \u8054\u76df\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u673a\u4f1a, \u5e76\u5177\u5907\u6539\u5584\u653f\u6cbb\u673a\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c, \u80cc\u666f\u5f88\u91cd\u8981, \u7279\u522b\u662f\u5730\u65b9\u6c11\u4e3b\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6, \u8054\u76df\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002"

              "Political feasibility is at the center of air-pollution policymaking in the developing world, affecting both the choices of policies and their implementation outcomes. Using India as a test case, we demonstrate how political considerations (e.g., public opinion, market structure, and government capacity) can be incorporated into quantitative models for environmental impact assessment. By examining a wide range of clean-air policies across the electricity, industrial, transportation, residential, and agricultural sectors, we find that policies with a great potential to mitigate air pollution can have varying degrees of political feasibility. Because some lower-feasibility policies also co-reduce carbon emissions (e.g., phasing out existing coal units), considering the effects of political feasibility is particularly important in achieving air-pollution and climate objectives simultaneously.",
              "Political-feasibility concerns are at the center of real-world air-pollution policymaking. Yet, these concerns are often not represented in leading decision-support tools that have been used for assessing policies' environmental impacts. Focusing on a wide range of clean-air policies in India, we assess their political-feasibility scores on the basis of public opinion, market, and institutional considerations and then incorporate these scores into the evaluation of environmental impacts by using an integrated assessment model (GAINS-South Asia). We demonstrate that although some policies with substantial potential to mitigate air pollution are also highly politically feasible (e.g., replacing solid fuels with cleaner fuels in households), others can be less politically feasible (e.g., banning agricultural waste burning). Because some clean-air policies co-reduce CO emissions and aerosols, considering varying degrees of political feasibility is particularly important in achieving air-pollution and climate objectives simultaneously because of its implications on the implementation scale and policy sequence."

              "Most earlier studies addressing factors contributing to Medicare costs (mostly defined as government payments) rely on relationships among geographic area means (e.g., ; [Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences 1999](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3165175/#b5); ;). Area-based analyses are particularly prone to bias from unmeasured demand or supply factors likely to confound relationships among area averages (Zuckerman et al. 2010). Moreover, beneficiaries within geographic areas are likely to have heterogeneous characteristics, within-area distributions of variables are likely to vary considerably across areas, and often will not be normally distributed (e.g., health status). As a result, associations among area means and ratios will likely deviate from those that would be estimated at the individual patient level (). Consequently, we estimate determinants of Medicare expenditures (costs) at the beneficiary level.\nAlthough no study can avoid specification bias by including all relevant variables, our study investigates a substantial number of both demand and supply-side variables, many of which were not included in previous work. Finally, we compare factors contributing to the costs of treating two sets of Medicare beneficiaries, based on their expected medical costs. It is important to understand how potential effects differ, because the factors that drive the utilization of high-cost beneficiaries are of greatest policy import.",
              "The 2006 average standardized medical cost for predicted high-cost beneficiaries was nearly U.S.$48,000, compared with about U.S.$7,000 for predicted low-cost patients (). (Median values were U.S.$37,704 and U.S.$3,406, respectively.) Overall, 69 percent of total costs were spent on the 25 percent classified as predicted high-cost beneficiaries. This is lower than the 85 percent typically reported for the 25 percent most costly beneficiaries because of our inability to perfectly predict high and low-cost users, the fact that we are using standardized costs, which truncates some outlier cases, and the exclusion of beneficiaries who received no Medicare services. Medicare payments were a higher percentage of total standardized costs among high-cost beneficiaries (88 versus 82 percent), reflecting greater use of Part A services. For instance, 79 and 84 percent of expenditures on hospitals and postacute care were incurred by predicted high-cost beneficiaries, respectively, compared with about 50 percent of physician service and outpatient costs. Inpatient and postacute care accounted for 63 percent of total costs of predicted high-cost beneficiaries, as compared with 34 percent for predicted low-cost beneficiaries.\nAnnual Standardized Costs and Medicare Payments among Predicted High- and Low-Cost Medicare Beneficiaries  \nMean Costs, Given Any Use | % of Total Costsin Category | Mean Costs, Given Any Use | % of Total Costs in Category | % of Costs Incurred by Predicted High-Cost Beneficiaries  \n\u201cOther\u201d includes clinical lab services, durable medical equipment, Part B drugs, hospice care, psychiatric facility care, and long-term care hospital care.\npresents multivariable results for predicted high-and low-cost beneficiaries. Along with model coefficients, we assess variables' relative importance by reporting elasticities for continuous variables and the coefficient as a percent of mean standardized costs for categorical variables.",
              "The Medicare fee difference variable generated the largest elasticities. Consistent with our hypothesis and previous research, higher relative fees are associated with greater service provision (; ;). The estimated elasticity is larger (0.41) among low-cost beneficiaries than among high-cost beneficiaries (0.23), suggesting physicians may exercise greater discretion in the treatment of healthier beneficiaries.\nAlthough models estimated over the entire sample of low- and high-cost patients explain two-thirds of the variation in beneficiaries' medical costs, several limitations should be noted. First, causal inferences should be made cautiously because the data are cross-sectional. Second, unobserved heterogeneity in the beneficiary population could be correlated with model variables and bias coefficients. Third, available data limit our ability to characterize all key features of local health care markets (e.g., level of care coordination). Fourth, there is no definitive way to define local healthcare markets and our use of counties for most market variables is driven by available data. Finally, the sample is only approximately representative of the elderly, non-ESRD Medicare beneficiaries because it excludes Medicare Advantage enrollees, new enrollees, and beneficiaries because use no physician services over an extended time period, and it uses an indirect sampling method.\nA final limitation is that our study focused only on costs, without considering effects on outcomes (for which claims data are not particularly suited). Though not reported here, we constructed mortality and ambulatory sensitive hospitalization rates (which are analyzed in another study). We did attempt to identify factors that were efficiency enhancing or diminishing by estimating parallel reduced-form models, but the results were ambiguous."

              "To measure this concept, one must measure costs, select appropriate outcome measures, determine whether and how to combine them, and compare state scores. Based on the methods used in the studies reviewed, a three-phased approach is recommended. First, MPR proposes to construct measures of costs per enrollee, stratified by enrollee categories. We also propose to standardize or adjust costs for factors that influence variation in state Medicaid spending that are clearly beyond state Medicaid agency control. Second, MPR would examine quality and access to care measures for which data is available across all or most states to assess whether variation in outcomes and variation in costs appear to be linked. Because the literature provides less guidance for Medicaid quality and other outcome measurement than for expenditure analyses, we will continue to seek input on appropriate outcome measures to be used. Third, MPR will assess alternate ways to rank and compare state performance on cost and outcome measures.\n##  Measuring Medicaid Spending and Costs\nCalculating per enrollee cost measures that support accurate cross-state comparisons requires several technical decisions, including: (1) how to stratify Medicaid enrollees to create reasonably similar comparison groups, (2) whether to examine costs for specific services and if so, how to identify service costs for enrollees in managed care plans, (3) whether to include or exclude costs that cannot be attributed to individual enrollees, such as administrative costs and disproportionate share hospital payments, and (4) how to adjust for factors that are beyond the control of state Medicaid agencies.",
              "Since the proportion of total enrollees in these groups varies by state, we could: (1) examine per enrollee expenditures separately for each of the subgroups, or (2) present only group-level (for example, aged) per enrollee expenditures, but standardize the measures so the proportion of enrollees within each subgroup (for example, aged/dual eligible, aged/not dual eligible) is held constant in assessing overall group level per enrollee expenditures. Because limited-benefit enrollees (for example, adults qualifying only for family planning services) account for a small proportion of Medicaid spending and receive very few services, we do not recommend including them in analyses of per enrollee expenditures.\nService Costs and Medicaid Managed Care. Measures of efficiency often focus on cost per unit of service. In the Medicaid context, this would mean comparing spending per enrollee for discrete service categories, such as hospital inpatient care, prescription drugs, nursing home care, and physician visits. But lower cost per service does not necessarily produce higher value in terms of better quality or other outcomes. In addition, from the purchaser\u2019s perspective, efficiency could result from a different of services provided to enrollees, which argues against analyzing costs at the unit of service level.",
              "For these reasons, we recommend (1) measuring state Medicaid spending for population subgroups for two broad categories of services---acute care and long-term-care---rather than for specific services, and (2) combining fee-for-service (FFS) and managed care populations in each of these two service categories, to the extent that enrollees in managed care organizations (MCOs) can be divided into those receiving primarily acute care versus long-term care services. This higher level of aggregation should produce useful comparisons across states about the efficiency or value obtained through the mix of services provided, and through greater or lesser use of capitated or other forms of managed care compared to fee-for-service payment and delivery models. It is also a practical decision; limitations in the availability of service-specific expenditure data for Medicaid managed care enrollees, whose care is paid on a capitation basis, would restrict detailed comparisons of per-service costs to a small subset of states with little managed care enrollment, or to the long-term care sector where managed care is not as prevalent.\n. Numerous studies and reports highlight large variation in the amount and proportion of total state Medicaid spending on DSH expenditures. However, since DSH payments, and other payments cannot be attributed to individual Medicaid enrollees, and DSH payments cover the cost of care for non-Medicaid, indigent individuals, we do not recommend including these costs in our analysis."

These include modelling approaches to estimating mortality- and morbidity-related effects from health spending, measurement of key variables, accounting for endogeneity in the health spending on health outcomes equation, the inclusion of lagged spending, discounting and future costs, the use of analytical weights, level of disease aggregation and the expected duration of health gains.  \nFuture estimates of the marginal cost per unit of health produced by a healthcare system should include (1) careful consideration of the specific context and data available, (2) clear and transparent reporting on the assumptions made and stakeholder perspectives on their appropriateness and acceptability, and (3) assessment of the sensitivity of the preferred central estimate to these assumptions.",
              "Estimates of the marginal cost per unit of health produced by the healthcare system present an important policy tool to guide funding decisions for new health technologies and interventions by facilitating the interpretation of cost-effectiveness analyses that represent a key input to many national reimbursement decisions. Building on earlier work by Martin et al. [, ], the seminal work by Claxton et al. [] presented the first empirical estimate of the marginal cost per unit of health of the NHS in England, followed by similar estimates for Spain [], Australia [], Sweden [], The Netherlands [, ], South Africa [] and China []. The broad rationale for estimating the marginal cost per unit of health produced by the healthcare system in these reviewed studies was to guide health funding decisions. Where the true opportunity cost is unknown, that is, when decisions to fund a new health technology or intervention do not specify what is to be forgone, then an empirical estimate can provide the next best option to quantify the net health impact."

(node_6)\n  - Cost\u2011effectiveness caveats and uncertainty/gaps: Node_6 provides no completed benefit\u2013cost comparisons for program packages and explicitly flags missing data (total_enrollees, admin/build\u2011out costs, quantified offsets, revenue yields/incidence); these gaps prevent credible net\u2011cost or BCR calculations. (node_6)\n\n- B. Implementation (operational & behavioral) considerations\n  - Major operational challenges and scale constraints: Implementation faces poor local adaptation of evidence, constrained upfront financing for supports, heavy daily workloads, workforce shortages and burnout, insufficient training/coaching, weak organizational readiness, regulatory/billing limits, infrastructure/EHR/workflow barriers, fragmentation across agencies, and measurement/feedback gaps. (node_7)\n  - Timelines and sequencing constraints: Node_7 recommends starting with pilots, seed federal grants, and phased scale\u2011ups because administrative capacity and cross\u2011jurisdictional coordination are limited and require time to build.

(node_6; node_7)\n  - Equity implications and measurement shortfalls: Node_7 states equity impacts (who wins/loses or regional disparities) were not analyzed in the supplied synthesis and therefore require disaggregated measurement and evaluation to identify differential impacts.

              "Published: Jul 30, 2015. Publicly Released: Aug 31, 2015. \nMore than 80 federal programs (including 6 tax expenditures) provide aid to people with low incomes, based on GAO's survey of relevant federal agencies. Medicaid (the largest by far), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) comprised almost two-thirds of fiscal year 2013 federal obligations of $742 billion for these programs. Aid is most often targeted to groups of the low-income population, such as people with disabilities and workers with children. Survey responses showed that criteria used to determine eligibility vary greatly; most common were variants of the federal poverty guidelines, based on the Census Bureau's official poverty measure.\nIn 2013, 48.7 million people (15.5 percent), including many households with children, lived in poverty in the United States, based on Census's Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). This measure takes into account certain expenses and federal and state government benefits not included in the official poverty measure. The SPM is not used to determine program eligibility; however, it does provide more information than the official measure on household resources available to meet living expenses. In 2013, the SPM poverty threshold ranged from $21,397 to $25,639 for a family of four, depending on housing situations. Based on six mutually exclusive household types GAO developed, individuals in a household headed by a person with a disability or a single parent had the highest rates of poverty using the SPM, while childless or married parent households had larger numbers of people in poverty using the SPM.",
              "In 2012, the most recent year of data available, GAO estimated that 106 million people, or one-third of the U.S. population, received benefits from at least one or more of eight selected federal low-income programs: Additional Child Tax Credit, EITC, SNAP, SSI, and four others. Almost two-thirds of the eight programs' recipients were in households with children, including many married families. More than 80 percent of recipients also lived in households with some earned income during the year. Without these programs' benefits, GAO estimated that 25 million of these recipients would have been below the SPM poverty threshold. Of the eight programs, EITC and SNAP moved the most people out of poverty, however, the majority of recipients of each of the programs were estimated to have incomes above the SPM threshold, after accounting for receipt of benefits.\nResearch suggests that assistance from selected means-tested low-income programs can encourage people's participation in the labor force, but have mixed effects on the number of hours they work. Changes in certain low-income programs through the years, including the EITC, have enhanced incentives for people to join the labor force, according to studies. While workers who receive means-tested benefits face benefit reductions as their earnings rise, research shows that various factors limit how much people change their work behavior in response. For example, people may not be aware of such changing interactions in a complex tax and benefit system or be able to control the number of hours they work, according to studies. Research also shows that enhancing work incentives can create difficult policy trade-offs, including raising program costs or failing to provide adequate assistance to those in need.\n##  Why GAO Did This Study",
              "The federal government provides assistance aimed at helping people with low-incomes who may earn too little to meet their basic needs, cannot support themselves through work, or who are disadvantaged in other ways. With fiscal pressures facing the federal government and the demands placed on aid programs, GAO was asked to examine federal low-income programs.\nThis report (1) describes federal programs (including tax expenditures) targeted to people with low incomes, (2) identifies the number and selected household characteristics of people in poverty, (3) identifies the number, poverty status, and household characteristics of selected programs' recipients, and (4) examines research on how selected programs may affect incentives to work. For a list of low-income programs that were $100 million in obligations or more in fiscal year 2013, GAO consulted with the Congressional Research Service; surveyed and interviewed officials at relevant federal agencies; and reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency guidance. GAO also conducted analyses on low-income individuals using Census data on the SPM and official poverty measure and microsimulation data from the Urban Institute that adjusts for under-reporting of benefit receipt in Census survey data. To examine labor force effects, GAO reviewed economic literature. Selected low-income programs were large in dollars and helped meet a range of basic needs.\nGAO is not making new recommendations in this report. GAO clarified portions in response to comments from one agency.\nFor more information, contact Kay Brown at (202) 512-7215 or ."

              "In the half century since President Lyndon B. Johnson declared an unconditional War on Poverty, the Federal Government has invested in strategies that aim to relieve and prevent poverty. Partly as a result of these programs, and a large number of additions and reforms since then, between 1967 and 2012, poverty measured by a measure that accounts for tax and transfer payments 9.8 percentage points, or 38 percent. In 2013, income and nutrition assistance programs lifted 46 million people, including 10 million children, out of the poverty. Medicaid has also resulted in better health care for tens of millions of Americans. Another 16 million people have gained coverage the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage expansions, as of early 2015.\nInnovative economic research is increasingly finding that these programs have long-run benefits for the children in families that receive them. These studies often drawn upon large \u201cadministrative\u201d data sets that are collected in the process of running government programs. These data sources frequently allow researchers to track families over long periods of time with limited attrition, offer much larger sample sizes, and suffer from less missing data than major household surveys. These improvements in data quality have coincided with a \u201c\u201d in economics that has greatly expanded the use of randomized trials and \u201cquasi-experimental\u201d research designs that exploit natural experiments to estimate the causal impact of the programs.\nThe following is a selection of research in this area for five major current programs\u2014early education, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (SNAP), housing vouchers, and Medicaid\u2014plus one historical income support program.\n1.

              "Cash transfers (CTs), for all their evident success in relieving poverty, have been criticised for failing to incorporate transformative elements into their programme design. In recent years changes have been introduced into the design of CT programmes that go some way towards addressing this concern. This article critically engages the meaning of transformative social protection and introduces a collection of papers that examine whether and under what conditions cash transfers can be \u2018transformative\u2019. Among the issues addressed are whether CTs can be catalysts leading to positive changes, material, subjective and relational in the lives of poor people; what are the social effects of CTs for beneficiaries, their households and communities; and can they foster horizontal relationships within communities and vertical relationship with the state through developing forms of social accountability and citizenship engagement?\nWith the eradication of extreme poverty as a priority Millennium Development Goal, cash transfer programmes (CTPs) spread rapidly across the world to reach more than 750 million people in low and middle-income countries in the global south by 2010 (Arnold, Conway, & Greenslade, ). As new programmes multiplied, older ones expanded their coverage to reach significant numbers of targeted populations in the lowest decile. Driving the expansion of CTs was their widely acclaimed record of positive results. Evidence from across the world confirmed that well targeted, well designed social transfer programmes were an effective and affordable instrument for reducing the incidence and intensity of household poverty with measureable improvements in child health and educational attendance (Arnold et al., ; Cecchini & Madariaga, ; Fiszbein et al., ; Soares, Soares, Medeiros, & Guerreiro Os\u00f3rio, ). One commentator, echoing a commonly expressed view, went as far as to state that they were \u2018as close as you can come to a magic bullet in development\u2019.",
              "The articles in the first section of the Special Issue find that CTPs have largely positive outcomes including enhanced self esteem at the individual level, as well as enabling greater participation in social interaction. However in some cases there can be negative side effects of being part of the programme such as feelings of humiliation, stigma and shame due to reliance on the transfer for support. The article by Samuels and Stavropoulou discusses findings from the Transforming Cash Transfers project in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East; that by Attah et al. draws on evaluations of CTPs in east, west and southern Africa, while Adato et al. focus on a South African case study. There is evidence in all three articles of the effects of cash transfer programmes on psychosocial health and behaviour. Both Attah et al. and Samuels and Stavropoulou look at how psychosocial wellbeing affects both individuals and their relation to others. Attah et al. present findings from a mixed method evaluation of a cash transfer in Kenya, and from cross-country qualitative research from Ghana, Zimbabwe and Lesotho. They pay particular attention to the intrinsic and instrumental dimensions of psychosocial wellbeing showing that cash transfers can have positive impacts on psychosocial wellbeing leading to further positive impacts on educational performance, participation in social life and empowerment for decision-making."

              "Research has shown that poverty experienced during early childhood is associated with worse child, youth, and adult outcomes. Aspects of development affected by poverty early in life include learning, educational attainment, physical and mental health, and adult earnings. The negative effects of poverty may be particularly strong when it is experienced during early childhood, relative to later in childhood and in adolescence. Developmental theory suggests that family processes play an important role in explaining associations between income poverty and children\u2019s outcomes. However, the extent to which income support and anti-poverty initiatives causally affect family processes among families with low incomes is not well understood.\nMany longitudinal, non-experimental studies have established the cascading effects of economic hardship and low income, which contribute to parental psychological distress and reduce the quality of family relationships, parenting, and child outcomes. The goal of this randomized controlled study is to examine the extent to which a multi-year cash transfer program\u2014which provides an ~$4000 annual unconditional cash transfer, distributed monthly as a cash gift on a debit card to participants who had given birth (henceforth, mothers) and had prior-year household income below the federal poverty threshold\u2014affects economic hardship, maternal well-being, family relationships, and parenting across the first three years of life.",
              "Most conditional and unconditional cash transfer programs have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries. Experimental evaluations of these programs typically include some measures of economic well-being as well as physical and mental health, but few include measures of family processes. Systematic reviews of these international studies find that, on average, cash transfer programs improve food security and indicators of economic well-being as well as mental health. A recent meta-analysis of 45 conditional and unconditional cash transfer evaluations conducted in low- and middle-income countries found average effect sizes of +0.13 on adult subjective well-being and \u22120.07 on mental health problems (primarily depressive symptoms). In addition, most cash transfer programs either reduce intimate partner violence or do not affect it at all. Baranov et al.\u2019s meta-analysis found that cash transfer programs reduce intimate partner violence by 2\u20134% depending on the type of violence measured.",
              "However, systematic reviews suggest considerable heterogeneity in the estimated impacts of cash transfer programs on parent and child well-being, both across and within studies. McGuire et al.\u2019s meta-analysis found that unconditional cash transfers had larger impacts than conditional ones, and that impacts declined over time after the payments ended. Yet not all results are consistent\u2014an evaluation of a unconditional cash transfer program in Ecuador found that monthly cash transfers amounting to 10% of household income improved young children\u2019s development among families with the lowest incomes, but generated null to negative effects on maternal mental health among those same families. The same cash transfer in Ecuador reduced emotional violence in households for mothers with higher educational attainment, but not for mothers with lower educational attainment. Among mothers with lower educational attainment, if the mother\u2019s educational attainment was higher than her partner\u2019s, the cash transfer appeared to increase emotional violence."

In humanitarian contexts, cash transfers are often used to alleviate poverty and provide assistance in emergencies and in economic development. Evidence demonstrates that cash transfer programs, growing around the globe since the mid-1990s, are a cost-effective way to improve the lives of poor households across many domains.\nThese programs can impact a wide range of development outcomes because recipients purchase food, invest in agriculture, improve their shelter, and pay for medical and education expenses. Cash transfers address poor households\u2019 severe budget constraints and investment needs ranging across education, health, household, and business.\n_Read about our work in:_\nCash transfer programs come in many designs that vary by conditionality, targeted population, size of grant, frequency of grant, and length of the program. They are one of the most studied development programs today with much evidence demonstrating their success, yet there remain questions about how variations in programs can affect their impact. Does adding resources or services to the cash transfers maximize their benefits? How can they be adapted for use in refugee camps or with migrant populations? \nAIR\u2019s extensive expertise in evaluating cash transfers provides a unique ability to assess commonalities and differences across cash transfer programs. AIR took this opportunity to synthesize findings across studies to identify lessons for designing cash transfer programming.\nWhile impact evaluations are an essential component for creating a rigorous evidence base on the effectiveness of cash transfer programs, mixed-methods evaluations of program design and implementation fidelity are critical to understand how cash transfer programs work.",
              "This program aims to reduce child poverty, improve child well-being, and promote access to basic services for families. It has three components: a regular cash transfer, distributed to the primary caregiver of children ages 0-2; a social behavior change communication package around positive nutrition and hygiene practices; and family support services for the most vulnerable program participants. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) Mozambique hired AIR and its partners to conduct a 24-month, longitudinal impact evaluation and process evaluation of this program\u2019s start-up phase.\nBased on the evidence that AIR generated, the Government of Mozambique decided to expand the \"cash and care\" model, aiming to reach 500,000 children for the period from 2022 to 2026 in 10 provinces. The expansion plan aims to cover approximately 20 percent of the children aged 0-2. \nAlthough the number of refugee children enrolled in school in Turkey has increased significantly in recent years, a number of obstacles mean nearly 40 percent of Syrian children living in Turkey remain out of school. UNICEF Turkey contracted with AIR to conduct a rigorous program evaluation of the Conditional Cash Transfer for Education for Syrians and Other Refugees, which provides bimonthly cash payments to eligible households and targeted support in the form of child protection outreach visits to households with children deemed to be most at risk. \nThe relationship between happiness and income is at the center of a vibrant debate, as emotional states are an important determinant of health and social behavior. This journal article discusses whether a government-run unconditional cash transfer paid directly to women in poor households had an impact on self-reported happiness.\n### Cash Transfers Explained: How Cash Empowers Poor Families in Zambia (Video)"

              "Cash transfer programs have emerged as potent tools for alleviating poverty and enhancing the living conditions of the most deprived households in developing nations. Such initiatives have now become integral components of social protection systems in many developing countries, including Pakistan. Evaluating the efficacy of these safety nets is crucial to comprehend their value in terms of public expenditure. This research employed a well-being index to gauge the impact of unconditional cash transfers on the socioeconomics of recipients. By employing three rounds of the BISP impact assessment survey conducted in 2011, 2016, and 2019. The study measured the overall impact of cash transfers on well-being by utilizing Principal Component Analysis in conjunction with a Difference-in-Differences Quasi-Experimental design over the years. The findings of the study indicate that between 2011 and 2016, the socioeconomic status declined for both treatment and control groups, but the reduction was less pronounced among those who received treatment compared to the control group with insignificant. From 2016 to 2019, there was a marginal positive increase in socioeconomic status, although it was of insignificance. Overall, the well-being of both the control and treatment groups decreased from 2011 to 2019, with a slightly more pronounced improvement observed in the treatment group. This trend suggests that the impact of the BISP unconditional cash transfer program had a limited effect on altering the well-being of the beneficiaries. The lack of substantial impact from the BISP\u2019s cash transfers on household well-being can be attributed to factors such as inflation, unemployment, economic slowdown, payment challenges, insufficient funding, and gaps between installments. The government of Pakistan should reconsider the substantial investment in BISP within the context of value for money",
              "### Similar content being viewed by others\nCash transfers have emerged as a powerful tool in reducing poverty and improving the wellbeing of the poorest households in developing countries (Baird et al. ). These transfers provide direct monetary assistance to low-income families with the primary objective of improving their income and increasing their consumption of essential commodities (Handa and Davis ). According to recent estimates, cash transfers have already benefitted approximately 718 million people in developing countries, with the numbers expected to rise in the coming years (De Groot et al. ).\nIn the short term, these transfers can provide resources that families can use to meet immediate needs like food and shelter, while in the long term, they can enable families to invest in education, health, and other productive activities to break out of the poverty cycle (Ayoo ). Cash transfers can also empower women, improve school attendance, and contribute to better nutrition and health outcomes, particularly in patriarchal societies where women have limited access to resources and decision-making (Sugiyama and Hunter ).\nCash transfer schemes are now an integral part of the social protection systems of many developing countries due to poverty and social well-being being significant obstacles to sustainable development. Education, health, and women\u2019s empowerment are particularly critical areas that need to be addressed (De Groot et al. ). Despite progress made over the past few decades, the challenges remain substantial. For instance, although more than one billion individuals were lifted out of extreme poverty between 1990 and 2011, 258 million children and youth worldwide are still out of school. Moreover, 828 million people in 2021 do not have sufficient food to eat (UNICEF ; WFP and UNICEF ).",
              "Additionally, this research investigates the differential impact of socioeconomic and cash transfers on household and beneficiaries\u2019 characteristics. The findings of this research are crucial for informing evidence-based policy analysis to scale up contributions to cash transfer programs. This is particularly relevant in the context of national government commitments to improving value for money, expanding coverage, ensuring financial sustainability, clarifying the level and type of impact, and adequately reflecting these in social wellbeing. Moreover, this research aims to take a strategic approach to providing technical assistance on national cash transfer systems, in line with the government\u2019s commitment to reducing poverty, improving health, education, and empowering women.\nIn the world, across 72 to 149 Social Safety Nets (SSN)/Social Assistance (SA) programs have been launched in various developing and developed nations to alleviate poverty, increase well-being, social development, and safeguard against economic shocks (Saleem and World Bank ). In developing nations, tailored interventions have long been used to reduce poverty and promote social well-being. Ivaschenko et al. () investigate trends in SSN programme coverage, spending, and programme performance throughout the world and find evidence of an increasing commitment to SSN/SA programmes, emphasizing their substantial contribution to poverty reduction efforts. However, they also stress the continuous difficulty of low programme coverage and benefits, implying that while these programmes have made achievements, more effort is needed to achieve meaningful poverty reduction."

              "The next sections will provide an overview of specific challenges behavioral health practitioners and organizations may face when utilizing an EBP that are related to implementation practice. It will also provide recommendations for future research efforts, to be informed by key stakeholders, aimed at developing implementation practice capacity to improve the implementation of EBPs and client outcomes.\n##  Issues for Consideration in Implementation Practice\n### Challenges to implementation of evidence-based practices\nAlthough the promotion of EBPs in health services represented a critical advancement in behavioral health care, the well-intentioned push towards the use of EBPs often fails to close the gap between the best available research and practice. EBPs must be effectively matched to community needs, implemented with fidelity to the standards of the intervention, and integrated within regular practices, so they may be sustained over time to ensure better outcomes for consumers. An organization adopting an EBP without first considering implementation and its associated barriers may not be able to ensure effective outcomes among clients. To achieve positive outcomes, EBPs must not simply be implemented but implemented with quality. However, behavioral health organizations and practitioners face significant challenges to successful implementation. These include the following: (1) being able to access and understand research findings and interpret them for the needs of their clients, agency, and community; (2) being able to identify and select EBPs they can afford; (3) being able to do the actual work of implementing the EBP through staff training, instituting new policies, and negotiating new contracts; and (4) integrating these changes so these efforts can be sustained.",
              "Practitioners may also have difficulties in matching EBPs that are often developed with very narrow and specific populations, with their more diverse clientele. Those they serve may suffer from multiple, complex issues bridging mental and physical health concerns, historic disparities and discrimination, poverty, mobility, and education. A topic that has caused tension in the research community is the discussion of fidelity and adaption. While many argue that adaptations are necessary to meet the needs of a specific setting, others postulate that an EBP that has been adapted may compromise the core elements of the program and be less effective when compared to the original program. Although fidelity has become the \u201cgold standard\u201d for successful program implementation, it may not take into consideration how a program fits within a context. In addition, organizational characteristics such as readiness for change, climate, staffing, leadership, and funding can significantly impact the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of EBPs. Sustainability may require long-term commitments to facilitate change, including the support of new policies, procedures, and infrastructure enhancements. Supporting implementation and sustainability may require new partnerships and collaborations, sufficient funding, and ongoing problem-solving. illustrates the core challenges of translating implementation science into implementation practice.\nCore Challenges of Translating Implementation Science into Implementation Practice",
              "A significant amount of IS research is often conducted with limited collaboration or input from key stakeholders (i.e., clients, practitioners, and service organizations). This may result in an implementation strategy that does not take real-world barriers into consideration, that may be used incorrectly, and/or that is unable to be replicated. In order to develop tangible, applicable, and sustainable strategies for capacity building among practitioners and service organizations in implementation practice, it is essential that the strategies are created and tested in collaboration with the key stakeholders intended for its use.\nGiven these challenges and the lack of opportunity for formal training related to EBPs and IS, strategies are needed to build practice level capacity in service organizations for identifying, adopting, implementing, and sustaining EBPs. To influence professional practice, practitioners and service organizations must know how to (1) choose between competing theories, frameworks, models, and strategies of implementation; (2) must be able to determine which issues are most central to consider for their agency; (3) assess fit for their population; (4) acquire and/or allocated resources; (5) determine which approach(es) have the highest potential to produce successful implementation in their unique service setting; and (6) marshal resources to ensure continuation and continuity of the supports necessary for sustainability.\nThis capacity must address the organization\u2019s ability to adjust and account for changes at systems levels, within Federal and state regulations and licensing and funding requirements; at organizational levels, including considering the organization of programs, the structure of the organization, and its relation to other practitioners; and within the consumer community\u2014by building tolerance, trust, and acknowledging the expectations of consumers (see )."

              "Implementation of EBPs in poor school district settings poses a unique set of challenges. Under-resourced schools often utilize mental health teams comprising both school district and community mental health agency employees ([Markle, Splett, Maras, & Weston, 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4553241/#R53)). The use of multiple providers from different organizational contexts may lead to a fragmented system of care where goals may not be in alignment, and it is unclear who is responsible for presenting problems that traverse both academic and behavioral domains. With the fiscal challenges that poorer school districts face each year, staff is often extremely limited and competing priorities may exacerbate available staff shortage for implementation in these settings (). Support staff and other personnel often are not trained mental health providers, but given staff limitations, they may be responsible for implementation and may not see that as their role or priority ([Benjamin, Taylor, Goodin, & Creed, 2014](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4553241/#R14)).",
              "Many school systems face significant reductions in public funds (; ) that significantly impact the ability to dedicate upfront resources for intervention materials, space, staff training and professional development. Structural and practical issues may be important to consider as well. For instance, shorter school class periods may hinder mental health teams attempts to follow an intervention manual that was initially developed for 60-minute outpatient sessions (e.g., ).\nBarriers to sustainment may arise in the (a) development of principal and other administrator support; (b) alignment of the intervention with school philosophy, goals, policies, and programs; (c) visibility of program outcomes to key stakeholders; and (d) development of support systems for implementers ().",
              "Schools in under-resourced school districts may be the focus of multiple new initiatives that often become fragmented and work at cross-purposes ([Ahram, Stembridge, Fergus, & Noguera, 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4553241/#R4)). This can affect implementation and sustainment of academic and non-academic best practices and contribute to negative attitudes toward the implementation of new initiatives, such as those related to the implementation of mental health EBPs (). This can be especially challenging when competing systems-level stakeholders are present, which may create a climate that is not conducive to long-term initiatives.\nFor example, as previously discussed, in one common school-based mental health approach schools contract with community behavioral health agencies to provide mental health teams to deliver services in the school setting (i.e., co-location; ). This is the approach implemented in most large US cities and in poor rural and suburban school districts. In the co-location approach, it is important to consider that agency leadership may vary in their support of EBP and their level of support often influences the resources and support available to mental health teams being asked to participate in EBP implementation. Community agencies may differ with school administrators on methodology of care, and negotiating these differences can be challenging."

              "Factors operating at the organizational domain (i.e., associated with the entity implementing the task-sharing intervention) were identified primarily as barriers. Studies cited several limited clinical resources as impeding implementation. From the clients\u2019 perspective, understaffed clinics had long waiting times and limited scheduling which reduced engagement, particularly for clients whose socioeconomic situation had constrained their availability to attend appointments. From the providers\u2019 perspective, providers in such clinics needed to manage large caseloads which may potentially lead to burnout or decreased quality of care. Physical space constraints in health clinics also posed a major barrier, such as limiting the ease of achieving privacy for private counseling sessions with users. The absence of these resources constrained effective, sustained client participation by limiting the frequency of appointments or by making clients more reluctant to meaningfully disclose concerns or conditions due to a lack of privacy.\nImplementation climate factors such as collaboration with other entities or healthcare workers on the ground in the delivery of interventions were found to be more successful. For instance, existing networks between providers facilitated referrals from task-sharing workers to specialists and other care providers [], but a relative lack of these types of networks made implementation more difficult []."

              "If outcomes are unsatisfactory and fidelity is low, then the first approach is to improve or modify implementation supports (e.g., more targeted staff recruitment and selection, increased skill-based training, and frequency and type of coaching) in order to improve fidelity (Webster-Stratton, Reinke, Herman, & Newcomer, in press). Or it may be necessary to review the organizational factors (e.g., time allocated for coaching, access to equipment needed for the intervention) and systemic constraints (e.g., licensure requirements that limit recruitment, billing constraints, inappropriate referrals) that may be making it difficult to achieve high fidelity. Making changes to address organizational and/or systems issues (e.g., funding, licensure, billing) often require considerable time and effort. Therefore, the implementation supports of selection, training, and coaching may need to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccompensate' for the organizational and systems barriers (Fixsen et al., 2005). For example, it may take time to address the funding constraints that make it difficult to fund coaching of staff. While attempts to fund the coaching are being pursued, it may be necessary to use more rigorous selection criteria to recruit more experienced staff or provide increased training to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccompensate' for the impact of funding on the provision of coaching.\nIn summary, this table brings home the point that both knowledge and measurement of the presence and strength of the core components (e.g., through fidelity and other measures), are required to interpret and respond to outcome data."

Behavioral health organizations particularly struggle with systems that don\u2019t accommodate their specialized documentation requirements and privacy regulations.\n###  What did hospitals do wrong when introducing electronic health records?\nHospitals often underestimated the complexity of by rushing needs assessments, failing to adequately train staff, and not properly optimizing clinical workflows. Many also neglected the critical change management aspects, leading to resistance from clinical staff and implementation of systems that increased rather than decreased documentation burden.",

Many entered the field motivated by direct patient care, not technological proficiency, making comprehensive training absolutely essential for successful adoption.\nImplementation failures frequently stem from:\n  * One-size-fits-all training approaches that don\u2019t address role-specific needs\n  * Insufficient training hours (industry benchmarks suggest 8-12 hours minimum per user)\n  * Training schedules that don\u2019t accommodate clinical workloads\n  * Lack of ongoing support and refresher opportunities after go-live\n  * Failure to address psychological resistance to technology adoption"

              "The social safety net\u2019s disjointedness and complexity require needy families to interact multiple times with government agencies to access benefits. Some complexity is necessary to ensure only eligible families receive assistance. However, the myriad possible program and service combinations create a bureaucratic web that government officials and benefit recipients must navigate.\nThe largest share of safety-net spending goes to means-tested health insurance programs, including Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. According to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, total Medicaid spending in fiscal year (FY) 2020 topped $649 billion, of which the federal government supported 67 percent, and the program covered approximately 76 million individuals. Medicaid overshadows other safety-net spending and deserves its own reforms (covered in Chapter 5 of this volume).\nThe remaining major means-tested safety-net programs (including refundable credits paid under the EITC and CTC) cost taxpayers over $300 billion annually in just federal outlays, as Table 1 illustrates. Excluding health care, the largest programs in terms of recipients and dollars cover four areas: income support, food and nutrition assistance, childcare, and housing and energy assistance. Table 1 briefly describes major programs and their 2019 costs before significant increases related to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTable 1. Description and Recent Federal Cost of Major Means-Tested Safety-Net Programs\nEarned Income Tax Credit (EITC) | \n  * The EITC provides at tax time a lump-sum benefit of up to about $6,700, depending on household income and family size, including to those without federal income tax liability. \n  * The EITC phases in at different rates depending on family size, starting with the first dollar earned and increasing as earnings rise.",
              "| Program expenditures were $32.0 billion.   \nHousing (Housing Choice Vouchers and Public Housing)  | \n  * Programs provide two types of assistance: tenant-based assistance such as vouchers to eligible families used for housing costs and project-based assistance such as apartments in public housing.\n  * Programs are administered by state housing authorities.\n  * Voucher amounts vary by state and follow fair market rent guidelines. Public housing assigns apartments to eligible recipients. Both programs generally require families to contribute 30 percent of income toward housing costs.\n  * Funding is limited, and not all eligible families receive assistance.\n\n| Program expenditures were $29.9 billion.   \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)  | \n  * LIHEAP assists low-income families with heating and electricity costs.\n  * It is administered by the states.\n  * Income eligibility varies by state, but household income must be below 150 percent of the federal poverty threshold, with categorical eligibility provided through TANF, SNAP, and SSI.\n  * Benefit amounts vary widely by state. \n\n| Program expenditures were $3.6 billion.   \nChild Care and Development Fund, which includes funding through the Child Care and Development Block Grant, also known as the Child Care Subsidy Program | \n  * The fund provides vouchers to eligible low- and moderate-income families to cover childcare costs, with some assistance through direct childcare \u201cslots.\u201d\n  * States generally pay childcare providers directly.

              "For medical services used by most Medicaid enrollees\u2014those who were not made eligible by the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\u2014the share of Medicaid costs paid by the federal government is specified by the federal medical assistance percentage rate (FMAP rate). The FMAP rate is determined by a formula that provides a higher rate of federal reimbursement for states with lower per capita income relative to the national average and a lower rate for higher-income states. By law, a state's FMAP rate can be no less than 50 percent and no more than 83 percent. The national average matching rate over the 2024\u20132032 period for services provided to those enrollees is projected to be 60 percent, with states contributing the remaining 40 percent. In 2021, federal spending governed by the FMAP formula was $397 billion, or about 75 percent of total federal Medicaid spending. Federal spending for states with FMAP rates set at the 50 percent floor accounted for 38 percent of that amount.",
              "The federal government's share of costs for medical services is considerably larger for enrollees who became eligible for Medicaid because of the optional expansion of eligibility under the ACA. That law allowed states to expand eligibility to all adults under age 65 (including parents and adults without dependent children) who have income below 138 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. (Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have adopted the expansion.) For those who are eligible as a result, the federal government's share of Medicaid costs is fixed at 90 percent and does not vary by state. That higher matching rate was made available\u2014even though those enrollees' health risks are typically lower than the health risks of some other eligible groups, such as the elderly and disabled\u2014in order to lower the financial cost to states of covering a group that had not generally been covered previously. In 2021, federal spending for services provided to those newly eligible enrollees was $99 billion, or about 20 percent of total federal Medicaid spending.",
              "The federal government's share of administrative expenses is also specified by statute and varies by the category of such costs, but not by state. The federal government's share of general administrative expenses is 50 percent; however, for 25 specified categories of administrative costs, the federal share ranges from about 70 percent to 100 percent. For example, the federal government pays 75 percent of the cost of employing skilled medical professionals for Medicaid administration, 75 percent of the cost of utilization review (the process of determining the appropriateness and medical necessity of various health care services), 90 percent of the cost of developing systems to manage claims and information, and 100 percent of the cost of prescription-drug monitoring programs. The overall average federal share for administrative expenses was 62 percent in 2021. That year, federal spending for Medicaid administration was $20 billion, or about 5 percent of total federal Medicaid spending.\nThis option consists of three alternatives, each of which would go into effect in October 2023.\n  * Under the first alternative, the federal government's share for all categories of administrative spending would be 50 percent.\n  * Under the second alternative, the 50 percent floor on the FMAP rate that applies to medical services for enrollees not made eligible by the ACA would be removed. Consequently, FMAP rates would fall below 50 percent for states with the highest per capita income. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this alternative would affect 13 states, and the new matching rates for those states would be between 4 percent and 49.75 percent.\n  * Under the third alternative, the federal share of medical expenditures for enrollees made eligible by the ACA would be based on the same FMAP formula that applies to all other enrollees."

              "# Eliminating the Medicaid Expansion Federal Match Rate: State-by-State Estimates\nThere are under consideration in Congress to significantly to help pay for an extension of expiring tax cuts. Medicaid is the primary program providing comprehensive health and long-term care to people living in the U.S. and accounts for nearly [$1 out of every $5](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-the-basics/) spent on health care. Medicaid is administered by states within broad federal rules and jointly funded by states and the federal government, meaning restrictions in federal Medicaid spending could leave states with about how to offset reductions. This analysis examines the potential impacts on states and Medicaid enrollees of one prominent proposal, which would eliminate the 90% federal match rate for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion, which currently covers over 20 million people. Key takeaways include:\n  * This analysis explores the impact of eliminating the ACA expansion match rate under two scenarios. The first assumes that states maintain Medicaid expansion coverage and pick up new expansion costs, resulting in a decrease of 10% (or $626 billion) in federal Medicaid spending and an increase of 17% (or $626 billion) in state Medicaid spending across all states over a 10-year period.\n  * The second scenario assumes that states drop the ACA Medicaid expansion in response to the elimination of the 90% federal match rate. This would result in a 25% (or $1.7 trillion) decrease in federal Medicaid spending and a 5% (or $186 billion) decrease in state Medicaid spending across all states over a 10-year period. This would also cut total Medicaid spending by nearly one-fifth (or $1.9 trillion), and nearly a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees (20 million people) would lose coverage.\n  * Only states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion would see any spending or enrollment impacts under this policy proposal, though changes vary by state.",
              "## What is the proposed policy change?\nStates that have implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion currently receive a 90%[federal match rate or \u201cFMAP\u201d](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-the-basics/)for adults covered through the expansion, meaning the federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion enrollees. The ACA expanded Medicaid coverage to nearly all adults with incomes up to 138% of the ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). However, a effectively made the decision to implement the Medicaid expansion an option for states. (including DC) have since adopted Medicaid expansion, and Medicaid expansion enrollees nearly a quarter of Medicaid enrollment (as of March 2024) and one-fifth of total Medicaid spending (as of FY 2023). The FMAP for services used by people eligible through traditional Medicaid is determined by a formula set in statute. The formula is designed so that the federal government provides a match rate of at least 50% and provides a higher match rate for states with lower average per capita income. For FY 2026, the traditional from 50% to 77%.\nThis analysis estimates the impact of eliminating the enhanced FMAP for adults in the Medicaid expansion. The analysis assumes that, starting in FY 2026, expenditures for people eligible in the Medicaid expansion would be matched at each state\u2019s traditional 2026 FMAP rate. Details regarding the design of this policy change have yet to be released, and the details of proposed legislation may differ from the assumptions made to complete this analysis. This is also only one of the various Medicaid policy changes that have been suggested and estimates would change if multiple policies were considered together.\n## What are the potential impacts on Medicaid spending and enrollment?",
              "This analysis does not make assumptions about specific state behavioral responses and instead examines the impact of eliminating the ACA expansion match rate under two scenarios. These scenarios are designed to illustrate the range of potential policy change effects; in practice, each state may respond to the policy change differently. While some states may choose to continue ACA Medicaid expansion coverage with substantially reduced federal funding, many likely would not given the extra spending that would be required. The analysis also excludes secondary effects such as people who lose coverage through the Medicaid expansion enrolling in Medicaid under other eligibility pathways or enrolling in private health coverage. The estimates presented here are not directly comparable to the from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) because CBO\u2019s estimates account for assumptions about state behavioral responses and other secondary effects.\n  * All expansion states pick up new expansion costs. Expansion enrollment and total spending would remain constant while costs shift from the federal government to the states.\n  * All states drop the ACA Medicaid expansion, resulting in changes to enrollment as well as total, federal, and state spending."

              "How does Medicaid expansion generate savings to offset such costs? Medicaid expansion allows states to access an enhanced federal match for some people who would otherwise be covered by traditional Medicaid (). Given that states pay between 25 percent and 50 percent of the cost for a traditional Medicaid beneficiary but only 10 percent of the cost for an expansion beneficiary, these savings can be substantial. States can save from 15 cents to 40 cents on every dollar of care it can shift to expansion (assuming 2020 expansion match rates).\nPrior research identifies several types of expansion beneficiaries who would likely receive traditional Medicaid in the absence of expansion. Some are people who would have been covered through specific Medicaid programs, such as Section 1115 waivers or the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program. Some are people who used to spend down assets or pursue a disability designation to qualify for Medicaid that now qualify for expansion. The populations affected vary from state to state, depending on the specifics of their traditional Medicaid programs.\nWhile researchers have a clear understanding of how expansion may reduce states\u2019 traditional Medicaid spending, calculating the magnitude of these savings is difficult. In expansion states, we only observe what happened with expansion \u2014 not what these states would have spent had they not expanded Medicaid."

              "Under the \u2019s 90 percent federal reimbursement percentage, $100 of financing gimmicks yields $900 in federal funds for the state. Under the average state\u2019s 60 percent federal reimbursement for traditional Medicaid recipients, $100 of financing gimmicks yields $150 in federal funds for the state. Money laundering for spending on the expansion population thus has a rate of return six times higher for the average state\u2014and more so for wealthier states that receive lower federal reimbursements for traditional recipients.\nThe federal government\u2019s near-total subsidization of the expansion group dramatically weakens states\u2019 incentives to enforce eligibility rules. When ineligible individuals receive benefits through the expansion group, states bear almost none of the cost. On the other hand, ineligible enrollment in Medicaid allows governors and state legislators to boast of reducing the uninsured rate, expanding health coverage for their constituents, and supporting local hospitals and insurers offering Medicaid plans. In essence, state policymakers reap the political benefits of allowing large numbers of ineligible enrollees in Medicaid while federal taxpayers foot the bill.\nDifferences in federal matching rates also create strong financial motives for states to classify individuals eligible for Medicaid under traditional pathways as expansion enrollees. For example, if the annual cost for a Medicaid enrollee is $10,000, states save $3,000 per year by placing them in the expansion group with a 90 percent federal match, compared to the 60 percent match for the traditional group. Research suggests that these types of reclassifications may be widespread, affecting millions of enrollees and substantially inflating federal spending on ."

I have [provided an overview of these provisions before](https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2024/11/27/federal-funding-cuts-to-medicaid-may-trigger-automatic-loss-of-health-coverage-for-millions-of-residents-of-certain-states/) and this week [I wrote about the operation of these statutes and constitutional amendments](https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2025/04/28/cuts-to-acas-medicaid-expansion-under-consideration-by-congress-would-lead-to-large-coverage-losses-hitting-some-states-harder-than-others/) should Congress substantially cut Medicaid expansion funding. My colleague Edwin Park [also reviewed one proposal to cut federal Medicaid expansion funding](https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2025/04/28/new-state-by-state-estimates-of-the-federal-funding-cuts-from-imposing-a-per-capita-cap-on-the-medicaid-expansion/) through a per capita cap and how both imposing a per capita cap on expansion and directly cutting the federal matching rate (the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage or FMAP) for the expansion would have the same effect: slashing federal support for the expansion by explicitly or effectively cutting the current 90% matching rate for the expansion."

              "As the foregoing suggests, strong matching requirements are the exception rather than the rule in federal grant programs. In fact, strong matching requirements present a tradeoff to federal policy-making officials. Many grants have the objective of providing a minimum floor of services across the nation and across all states or localities. From this perspective, strong matching requirements\u2014although prompting greater deliberation and oversight by state and local officials\u2014may also serve to discourage participation by these governments, thereby frustrating the provision of uniform minimum services throughout the country. The impacts of matching on grant participation can be particularly severe for fiscally hard-pressed entities for whom raising the nonfederal share constitutes a greater burden than for wealthier jurisdictions. Federal policy makers can adjust matching rates to reflect the differential fiscal capacity across the nation by varying the matching formula or by waiving matching for certain governments. Indeed, the federal Medicaid program allocates federal funds through a matching formula that provides a higher federal share to states with lower per capita incomes, as a proxy for fiscal capacity. However, for most programs, the matching rate is either lowered or eliminated, recognizing the importance that federal policy makers place on ensuring maximum participation in grant programs."

(evidence: node_2)\n- Aggregate federal cost implication of plausible expansions: node_3 reports that no program\u2011level expansion cost estimates or aggregate total federal costs are available in the provided materials and thus an aggregate federal cost cannot be calculated from the supplied sources; node_3 also emphasizes that financing feasibility depends critically on match\u2011design, statutory constraints, and phased rollout choices. (evidence: node_3)\n- Single\u2011sentence answer on need: There is a principled need to substantially increase federal social services to address likely unmet needs and avoid state\u2011level coverage/administration failures, but the magnitude and fiscal feasibility cannot be quantified from the supplied evidence because program\u2011level cost/benefit estimates are unavailable (benefit data: node_2; costs/feasibility: node_3). (evidence: node_2; node_3)\n\n2) Program\u2011by\u2011program bullets\n- Medicaid \u2014 current scale & coverage: FY2020 spending $649 billion; federal share 67%; enrollment \u224876 million (node_2). Evidence of benefits per expansion unit: node_2 contains no $/health\u2011outcome or $/QALY estimates for plausible expansions. (evidence: node_2) Cost to scale & likely offsets: node_3 reports no program\u2011level federal cost estimates are available and emphasizes financing depends on match design and statutory limits (node_3). Administrative/federal\u2013state feasibility constraints: node_3 flags state fiscal exposure under current FMAP formulas and that changes to match rules materially affect state uptake and timing (node_3). Short actionable assessment: medium priority \u2014 health expansions address large coverage needs (node_2) but feasibility and state fiscal exposure are major constraints without cost estimates (evidence: node_2; implementation caveat: node_3).\n\n- SNAP \u2014 current scale & coverage: FY2024 average monthly participants 41.7 million; FY2024 federal SNAP spending $99.8 billion; avg benefit $187.20/month; 12.3% of residents received SNAP (node_2). Evidence of benefits per expansion unit: node_2 provides no explicit dollars\u2011per\u2011poverty\u2011point or other cost\u2011effectiveness metrics. (evidence: node_2) Cost to scale & likely offsets: node_3 provides no dollar cost\u2011to\u2011scale estimates and notes financing/design matters for federal exposure (node_3). Administrative/federal\u2013state feasibility constraints: node_3 notes administrative capacity and federal\u2013state design affect rollout but federally administered cash\u2011like measures are more straightforward (node_3). Short actionable assessment: higher priority \u2014 large existing reach suggests high impact potential and higher feasibility if structured as federal spending that minimizes state match burdens (evidence: node_2; implementation caveat: node_3).\n\n- SSI / refundable EITC \u2014 current scale & coverage: refundable EITC expenditures reported $32.0 billion (2019); SSI recent counts not provided in node_2 (node_2). Evidence of benefits per expansion unit: node_2 contains no quantitative cost\u2011effectiveness estimates for expansions. (evidence: node_2) Cost to scale & likely offsets: node_3 gives no program cost estimates and highlights that federally administered cash benefits avoid state match complications (node_3). Administrative/federal\u2013state feasibility constraints: node_3 indicates higher feasibility for federally administered cash transfers (node_3). Short actionable assessment: high priority \u2014 federally administered cash/tax transfers are administratively feasible and can be scaled without state match exposure, but benefit\u2011per\u2011dollar evidence is not provided (evidence: node_2; implementation caveat: node_3).\n\n- Housing vouchers/public housing \u2014 current scale & coverage: federal spending reported $29.9 billion (2019); beneficiary counts not provided in node_2 (node_2). Evidence of benefits per expansion unit: node_2 provides no dollars\u2011per\u2011poverty\u2011point or housing\u2011outcome cost\u2011effectiveness estimates. (evidence: node_2) Cost to scale & likely offsets: node_3 reports no cost estimates for scaling housing supports and stresses financing/legal limits matter for match and federal/state roles (node_3). Administrative/federal\u2013state feasibility constraints: node_3 notes substantial administrative scaling and intergovernmental coordination would be required (node_3). Short actionable assessment: medium\u2011to\u2011low priority \u2014 need is clear from existing program size (node_2) but scaling faces administrative complexity and lacks quantified benefit\u2011per\u2011dollar evidence (evidence: node_2; implementation caveat: node_3).\n\n- Early\u2011childhood programs \u2014 current scale & coverage: Child Care & Development Fund median base rate for toddlers \u2248 $780/month (2019); no consolidated national federal spending or beneficiary count provided in node_2 (node_2). Evidence of benefits per expansion unit: node_2 does not provide quantitative cost\u2011effectiveness estimates for early\u2011childhood expansion. (evidence: node_2) Cost to scale & likely offsets: node_3 contains no dollar estimates for scaling early\u2011childhood programs and highlights that cross\u2011sector administrative scaling is challenging (node_3). Administrative/federal\u2013state feasibility constraints: node_3 rates long\u2011term outcome programs as low\u2011to\u2011medium feasibility due to required major administrative scale\u2011up and coordination (node_3). Short actionable assessment: lower priority (relative) \u2014 potentially high long\u2011term benefits but large administrative scaling needs and no provided cost\u2011effectiveness figures (evidence: node_2; implementation caveat: node_3).\n\n3) Cross\u2011program prioritization\n- Cost\u2011effectiveness evidence ranking: node_2 provides no dollars\u2011per\u2011poverty\u2011point, $/QALY, or benefit\u2011per\u2011dollar comparisons across programs, so ranking by value\u2011per\u2011dollar is not possible from the supplied data (node_2). (evidence: node_2)\n- Adjusted ranking incorporating feasibility: node_3 recommends prioritizing (1) federally administered poverty\u2011reduction measures (highest feasibility), (2) health expansions tied to generous federal match or conditional incentives (medium feasibility), and (3) long\u2011term outcome programs like early\u2011childhood/education/LT care (lower feasibility) \u2014 this forms the pragmatic top\u20113 given feasibility constraints despite absent cost\u2011effectiveness metrics (node_3). (evidence: node_3)\n\n4) Budgetary & financing assessment\n- Aggregate costs & financing: node_3 reports that no program\u2011level or aggregate total federal cost estimates or specific revenue/offset proposals are available in the provided materials, and stresses that financing feasibility hinges on match design (FMAP changes, ACA\u2011style matches), statutory/legal limits, and phased implementation; combine that with node_2\u2019s program scales (e.g., $649B Medicaid, $99.8B SNAP, $29.9B housing baseline figures) to show expansions would require large additional federal commitments though precise amounts are unspecified (evidence: node_3; node_2).\n\n5) Implementation timeline & risks\n- Timeline & key risks: node_3 recommends phased/multi\u2011year rollouts (10\u2011year modeling horizons typical) to reduce short\u2011term shocks; principal risks are state fiscal exposure from match changes, administrative capacity shortfalls that delay uptake, and the absence of program\u2011level benefit estimates to validate effectiveness \u2014 node_2 similarly lacks outcome quantification that increases uncertainty about realized benefits. Recommended monitoring indicators: enrollment/coverage rates, per\u2011recipient and program costs, short\u2011term outcomes (poverty, service use) and longer\u2011term outcomes (earnings, health) with staged evaluation cadence per node_3. (evidence: node_3; node_2)\n\n6) Uncertainties / caveats (mini\u2011bullet)\n- Main data and implementation uncertainties: missing program\u2011level expansion cost estimates and benefit\u2011per\u2011dollar metrics (node_2); legal/statutory constraints and match\u2011design implications for state uptake (node_3); administrative capacity and phased rollout timing that will affect realized coverage and outcomes (node_3). (evidence: node_2; node_3)\n\n7) Final concise conclusion\n- Expected benefits justify substantially increasing federal social services in principle because existing program scale and participation indicate large populations served and likely unmet needs (node_2), but without the missing program\u2011level cost\u2011effectiveness figures and with major feasibility constraints tied to match design and administrative capacity, expansions should proceed only with explicit financing designs, phased rollouts, and rigorous monitoring/evaluation to produce the needed benefit\u2011per\u2011dollar evidence (evidence: node_2; node_3)."

              "The social safety net\u2019s disjointedness and complexity require needy families to interact multiple times with government agencies to access benefits. Some complexity is necessary to ensure only eligible families receive assistance. However, the myriad possible program and service combinations create a bureaucratic web that government officials and benefit recipients must navigate.\nThe largest share of safety-net spending goes to means-tested health insurance programs, including Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. According to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, total Medicaid spending in fiscal year (FY) 2020 topped $649 billion, of which the federal government supported 67 percent, and the program covered approximately 76 million individuals. Medicaid overshadows other safety-net spending and deserves its own reforms (covered in Chapter 5 of this volume).\nThe remaining major means-tested safety-net programs (including refundable credits paid under the EITC and CTC) cost taxpayers over $300 billion annually in just federal outlays, as Table 1 illustrates. Excluding health care, the largest programs in terms of recipients and dollars cover four areas: income support, food and nutrition assistance, childcare, and housing and energy assistance. Table 1 briefly describes major programs and their 2019 costs before significant increases related to the coronavirus pandemic.\nTable 1. Description and Recent Federal Cost of Major Means-Tested Safety-Net Programs\nEarned Income Tax Credit (EITC) | \n  * The EITC provides at tax time a lump-sum benefit of up to about $6,700, depending on household income and family size, including to those without federal income tax liability. \n  * The EITC phases in at different rates depending on family size, starting with the first dollar earned and increasing as earnings rise.",

Public housing assigns apartments to eligible recipients. Both programs generally require families to contribute 30 percent of income toward housing costs.\n  * Funding is limited, and not all eligible families receive assistance.\n\n| Program expenditures were $29.9 billion.   \nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)  | \n  * LIHEAP assists low-income families with heating and electricity costs.\n  * It is administered by the states.\n  * Income eligibility varies by state, but household income must be below 150 percent of the federal poverty threshold, with categorical eligibility provided through TANF, SNAP, and SSI.\n  * Benefit amounts vary widely by state. \n\n| Program expenditures were $3.6 billion.   \nChild Care and Development Fund, which includes funding through the Child Care and Development Block Grant, also known as the Child Care Subsidy Program | \n  * The fund provides vouchers to eligible low- and moderate-income families to cover childcare costs, with some assistance through direct childcare \u201cslots.\u201d\n  * States generally pay childcare providers directly.

Unlike the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) or child nutrition programs, SNAP is not targeted to specific subgroups. SNAP households are diverse. In FY 2023, 28 percent of SNAP households had earned income; among households with children, 55 percent had earned income. In addition, 61 percent of households received unearned income from one or more sources (e.g., Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and/or State General Assistance); and 20 percent received no income from earned or unearned sources. Among SNAP households, 36 percent received the maximum benefit for their size, 9 percent received the minimum benefit, and the remainder received a benefit somewhere in between."

The FMAP rate is determined by a formula that provides a higher rate of federal reimbursement for states with lower per capita income relative to the national average and a lower rate for higher-income states. By law, a state's FMAP rate can be no less than 50 percent and no more than 83 percent. The national average matching rate over the 2024\u20132032 period for services provided to those enrollees is projected to be 60 percent, with states contributing the remaining 40 percent. In 2021, federal spending governed by the FMAP formula was $397 billion, or about 75 percent of total federal Medicaid spending. Federal spending for states with FMAP rates set at the 50 percent floor accounted for 38 percent of that amount.",
              "The federal government's share of costs for medical services is considerably larger for enrollees who became eligible for Medicaid because of the optional expansion of eligibility under the ACA. That law allowed states to expand eligibility to all adults under age 65 (including parents and adults without dependent children) who have income below 138 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. (Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have adopted the expansion.) For those who are eligible as a result, the federal government's share of Medicaid costs is fixed at 90 percent and does not vary by state. That higher matching rate was made available\u2014even though those enrollees' health risks are typically lower than the health risks of some other eligible groups, such as the elderly and disabled\u2014in order to lower the financial cost to states of covering a group that had not generally been covered previously. In 2021, federal spending for services provided to those newly eligible enrollees was $99 billion, or about 20 percent of total federal Medicaid spending.",
              "The federal government's share of administrative expenses is also specified by statute and varies by the category of such costs, but not by state. The federal government's share of general administrative expenses is 50 percent; however, for 25 specified categories of administrative costs, the federal share ranges from about 70 percent to 100 percent. For example, the federal government pays 75 percent of the cost of employing skilled medical professionals for Medicaid administration, 75 percent of the cost of utilization review (the process of determining the appropriateness and medical necessity of various health care services), 90 percent of the cost of developing systems to manage claims and information, and 100 percent of the cost of prescription-drug monitoring programs. The overall average federal share for administrative expenses was 62 percent in 2021. That year, federal spending for Medicaid administration was $20 billion, or about 5 percent of total federal Medicaid spending.\nThis option consists of three alternatives, each of which would go into effect in October 2023.\n  * Under the first alternative, the federal government's share for all categories of administrative spending would be 50 percent.\n  * Under the second alternative, the 50 percent floor on the FMAP rate that applies to medical services for enrollees not made eligible by the ACA would be removed. Consequently, FMAP rates would fall below 50 percent for states with the highest per capita income. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this alternative would affect 13 states, and the new matching rates for those states would be between 4 percent and 49.75 percent.\n  * Under the third alternative, the federal share of medical expenditures for enrollees made eligible by the ACA would be based on the same FMAP formula that applies to all other enrollees."

              "# Eliminating the Medicaid Expansion Federal Match Rate: State-by-State Estimates\nThere are under consideration in Congress to significantly to help pay for an extension of expiring tax cuts. Medicaid is the primary program providing comprehensive health and long-term care to people living in the U.S. and accounts for nearly [$1 out of every $5](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-the-basics/) spent on health care. Medicaid is administered by states within broad federal rules and jointly funded by states and the federal government, meaning restrictions in federal Medicaid spending could leave states with about how to offset reductions. This analysis examines the potential impacts on states and Medicaid enrollees of one prominent proposal, which would eliminate the 90% federal match rate for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion, which currently covers over 20 million people. Key takeaways include:\n  * This analysis explores the impact of eliminating the ACA expansion match rate under two scenarios. The first assumes that states maintain Medicaid expansion coverage and pick up new expansion costs, resulting in a decrease of 10% (or $626 billion) in federal Medicaid spending and an increase of 17% (or $626 billion) in state Medicaid spending across all states over a 10-year period.\n  * The second scenario assumes that states drop the ACA Medicaid expansion in response to the elimination of the 90% federal match rate. This would result in a 25% (or $1.7 trillion) decrease in federal Medicaid spending and a 5% (or $186 billion) decrease in state Medicaid spending across all states over a 10-year period. This would also cut total Medicaid spending by nearly one-fifth (or $1.9 trillion), and nearly a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees (20 million people) would lose coverage.\n  * Only states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion would see any spending or enrollment impacts under this policy proposal, though changes vary by state.",
              "## What is the proposed policy change?\nStates that have implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion currently receive a 90%[federal match rate or \u201cFMAP\u201d](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-the-basics/)for adults covered through the expansion, meaning the federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion enrollees. The ACA expanded Medicaid coverage to nearly all adults with incomes up to 138% of the ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). However, a effectively made the decision to implement the Medicaid expansion an option for states. (including DC) have since adopted Medicaid expansion, and Medicaid expansion enrollees nearly a quarter of Medicaid enrollment (as of March 2024) and one-fifth of total Medicaid spending (as of FY 2023). The FMAP for services used by people eligible through traditional Medicaid is determined by a formula set in statute. The formula is designed so that the federal government provides a match rate of at least 50% and provides a higher match rate for states with lower average per capita income. For FY 2026, the traditional from 50% to 77%.\nThis analysis estimates the impact of eliminating the enhanced FMAP for adults in the Medicaid expansion. The analysis assumes that, starting in FY 2026, expenditures for people eligible in the Medicaid expansion would be matched at each state\u2019s traditional 2026 FMAP rate. Details regarding the design of this policy change have yet to be released, and the details of proposed legislation may differ from the assumptions made to complete this analysis. This is also only one of the various Medicaid policy changes that have been suggested and estimates would change if multiple policies were considered together.\n## What are the potential impacts on Medicaid spending and enrollment?",
              "This analysis does not make assumptions about specific state behavioral responses and instead examines the impact of eliminating the ACA expansion match rate under two scenarios. These scenarios are designed to illustrate the range of potential policy change effects; in practice, each state may respond to the policy change differently. While some states may choose to continue ACA Medicaid expansion coverage with substantially reduced federal funding, many likely would not given the extra spending that would be required. The analysis also excludes secondary effects such as people who lose coverage through the Medicaid expansion enrolling in Medicaid under other eligibility pathways or enrolling in private health coverage. The estimates presented here are not directly comparable to the from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) because CBO\u2019s estimates account for assumptions about state behavioral responses and other secondary effects.\n  * All expansion states pick up new expansion costs. Expansion enrollment and total spending would remain constant while costs shift from the federal government to the states.\n  * All states drop the ACA Medicaid expansion, resulting in changes to enrollment as well as total, federal, and state spending."

              "How does Medicaid expansion generate savings to offset such costs? Medicaid expansion allows states to access an enhanced federal match for some people who would otherwise be covered by traditional Medicaid (). Given that states pay between 25 percent and 50 percent of the cost for a traditional Medicaid beneficiary but only 10 percent of the cost for an expansion beneficiary, these savings can be substantial. States can save from 15 cents to 40 cents on every dollar of care it can shift to expansion (assuming 2020 expansion match rates).\nPrior research identifies several types of expansion beneficiaries who would likely receive traditional Medicaid in the absence of expansion. Some are people who would have been covered through specific Medicaid programs, such as Section 1115 waivers or the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program. Some are people who used to spend down assets or pursue a disability designation to qualify for Medicaid that now qualify for expansion. The populations affected vary from state to state, depending on the specifics of their traditional Medicaid programs.\nWhile researchers have a clear understanding of how expansion may reduce states\u2019 traditional Medicaid spending, calculating the magnitude of these savings is difficult. In expansion states, we only observe what happened with expansion \u2014 not what these states would have spent had they not expanded Medicaid."

Under the average state\u2019s 60 percent federal reimbursement for traditional Medicaid recipients, $100 of financing gimmicks yields $150 in federal funds for the state. Money laundering for spending on the expansion population thus has a rate of return six times higher for the average state\u2014and more so for wealthier states that receive lower federal reimbursements for traditional recipients.\nThe federal government\u2019s near-total subsidization of the expansion group dramatically weakens states\u2019 incentives to enforce eligibility rules. When ineligible individuals receive benefits through the expansion group, states bear almost none of the cost. On the other hand, ineligible enrollment in Medicaid allows governors and state legislators to boast of reducing the uninsured rate, expanding health coverage for their constituents, and supporting local hospitals and insurers offering Medicaid plans. In essence, state policymakers reap the political benefits of allowing large numbers of ineligible enrollees in Medicaid while federal taxpayers foot the bill.\nDifferences in federal matching rates also create strong financial motives for states to classify individuals eligible for Medicaid under traditional pathways as expansion enrollees. For example, if the annual cost for a Medicaid enrollee is $10,000, states save $3,000 per year by placing them in the expansion group with a 90 percent federal match, compared to the 60 percent match for the traditional group. Research suggests that these types of reclassifications may be widespread, affecting millions of enrollees and substantially inflating federal spending on ."

              "As the foregoing suggests, strong matching requirements are the exception rather than the rule in federal grant programs. In fact, strong matching requirements present a tradeoff to federal policy-making officials. Many grants have the objective of providing a minimum floor of services across the nation and across all states or localities. From this perspective, strong matching requirements\u2014although prompting greater deliberation and oversight by state and local officials\u2014may also serve to discourage participation by these governments, thereby frustrating the provision of uniform minimum services throughout the country. The impacts of matching on grant participation can be particularly severe for fiscally hard-pressed entities for whom raising the nonfederal share constitutes a greater burden than for wealthier jurisdictions. Federal policy makers can adjust matching rates to reflect the differential fiscal capacity across the nation by varying the matching formula or by waiving matching for certain governments. Indeed, the federal Medicaid program allocates federal funds through a matching formula that provides a higher federal share to states with lower per capita incomes, as a proxy for fiscal capacity. However, for most programs, the matching rate is either lowered or eliminated, recognizing the importance that federal policy makers place on ensuring maximum participation in grant programs."

The FMAP rate is determined by a formula that provides a higher rate of federal reimbursement for states with lower per capita income relative to the national average and a lower rate for higher-income states. By law, a state's FMAP rate can be no less than 50 percent and no more than 83 percent. The national average matching rate over the 2024\u20132032 period for services provided to those enrollees is projected to be 60 percent, with states contributing the remaining 40 percent. In 2021, federal spending governed by the FMAP formula was $397 billion, or about 75 percent of total federal Medicaid spending. Federal spending for states with FMAP rates set at the 50 percent floor accounted for 38 percent of that amount.",
              "The federal government's share of costs for medical services is considerably larger for enrollees who became eligible for Medicaid because of the optional expansion of eligibility under the ACA. That law allowed states to expand eligibility to all adults under age 65 (including parents and adults without dependent children) who have income below 138 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. (Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia have adopted the expansion.) For those who are eligible as a result, the federal government's share of Medicaid costs is fixed at 90 percent and does not vary by state. That higher matching rate was made available\u2014even though those enrollees' health risks are typically lower than the health risks of some other eligible groups, such as the elderly and disabled\u2014in order to lower the financial cost to states of covering a group that had not generally been covered previously. In 2021, federal spending for services provided to those newly eligible enrollees was $99 billion, or about 20 percent of total federal Medicaid spending.",
              "The federal government's share of administrative expenses is also specified by statute and varies by the category of such costs, but not by state. The federal government's share of general administrative expenses is 50 percent; however, for 25 specified categories of administrative costs, the federal share ranges from about 70 percent to 100 percent. For example, the federal government pays 75 percent of the cost of employing skilled medical professionals for Medicaid administration, 75 percent of the cost of utilization review (the process of determining the appropriateness and medical necessity of various health care services), 90 percent of the cost of developing systems to manage claims and information, and 100 percent of the cost of prescription-drug monitoring programs. The overall average federal share for administrative expenses was 62 percent in 2021. That year, federal spending for Medicaid administration was $20 billion, or about 5 percent of total federal Medicaid spending.\nThis option consists of three alternatives, each of which would go into effect in October 2023.\n  * Under the first alternative, the federal government's share for all categories of administrative spending would be 50 percent.\n  * Under the second alternative, the 50 percent floor on the FMAP rate that applies to medical services for enrollees not made eligible by the ACA would be removed. Consequently, FMAP rates would fall below 50 percent for states with the highest per capita income. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this alternative would affect 13 states, and the new matching rates for those states would be between 4 percent and 49.75 percent.\n  * Under the third alternative, the federal share of medical expenditures for enrollees made eligible by the ACA would be based on the same FMAP formula that applies to all other enrollees."

              "# Eliminating the Medicaid Expansion Federal Match Rate: State-by-State Estimates\nThere are under consideration in Congress to significantly to help pay for an extension of expiring tax cuts. Medicaid is the primary program providing comprehensive health and long-term care to people living in the U.S. and accounts for nearly [$1 out of every $5](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-the-basics/) spent on health care. Medicaid is administered by states within broad federal rules and jointly funded by states and the federal government, meaning restrictions in federal Medicaid spending could leave states with about how to offset reductions. This analysis examines the potential impacts on states and Medicaid enrollees of one prominent proposal, which would eliminate the 90% federal match rate for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion, which currently covers over 20 million people. Key takeaways include:\n  * This analysis explores the impact of eliminating the ACA expansion match rate under two scenarios. The first assumes that states maintain Medicaid expansion coverage and pick up new expansion costs, resulting in a decrease of 10% (or $626 billion) in federal Medicaid spending and an increase of 17% (or $626 billion) in state Medicaid spending across all states over a 10-year period.\n  * The second scenario assumes that states drop the ACA Medicaid expansion in response to the elimination of the 90% federal match rate. This would result in a 25% (or $1.7 trillion) decrease in federal Medicaid spending and a 5% (or $186 billion) decrease in state Medicaid spending across all states over a 10-year period. This would also cut total Medicaid spending by nearly one-fifth (or $1.9 trillion), and nearly a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees (20 million people) would lose coverage.\n  * Only states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion would see any spending or enrollment impacts under this policy proposal, though changes vary by state.",
              "## What is the proposed policy change?\nStates that have implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion currently receive a 90%[federal match rate or \u201cFMAP\u201d](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-financing-the-basics/)for adults covered through the expansion, meaning the federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion enrollees. The ACA expanded Medicaid coverage to nearly all adults with incomes up to 138% of the ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). However, a effectively made the decision to implement the Medicaid expansion an option for states. (including DC) have since adopted Medicaid expansion, and Medicaid expansion enrollees nearly a quarter of Medicaid enrollment (as of March 2024) and one-fifth of total Medicaid spending (as of FY 2023). The FMAP for services used by people eligible through traditional Medicaid is determined by a formula set in statute. The formula is designed so that the federal government provides a match rate of at least 50% and provides a higher match rate for states with lower average per capita income. For FY 2026, the traditional from 50% to 77%.\nThis analysis estimates the impact of eliminating the enhanced FMAP for adults in the Medicaid expansion. The analysis assumes that, starting in FY 2026, expenditures for people eligible in the Medicaid expansion would be matched at each state\u2019s traditional 2026 FMAP rate. Details regarding the design of this policy change have yet to be released, and the details of proposed legislation may differ from the assumptions made to complete this analysis. This is also only one of the various Medicaid policy changes that have been suggested and estimates would change if multiple policies were considered together.\n## What are the potential impacts on Medicaid spending and enrollment?",
              "This analysis does not make assumptions about specific state behavioral responses and instead examines the impact of eliminating the ACA expansion match rate under two scenarios. These scenarios are designed to illustrate the range of potential policy change effects; in practice, each state may respond to the policy change differently. While some states may choose to continue ACA Medicaid expansion coverage with substantially reduced federal funding, many likely would not given the extra spending that would be required. The analysis also excludes secondary effects such as people who lose coverage through the Medicaid expansion enrolling in Medicaid under other eligibility pathways or enrolling in private health coverage. The estimates presented here are not directly comparable to the from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) because CBO\u2019s estimates account for assumptions about state behavioral responses and other secondary effects.\n  * All expansion states pick up new expansion costs. Expansion enrollment and total spending would remain constant while costs shift from the federal government to the states.\n  * All states drop the ACA Medicaid expansion, resulting in changes to enrollment as well as total, federal, and state spending."

              "How does Medicaid expansion generate savings to offset such costs? Medicaid expansion allows states to access an enhanced federal match for some people who would otherwise be covered by traditional Medicaid (). Given that states pay between 25 percent and 50 percent of the cost for a traditional Medicaid beneficiary but only 10 percent of the cost for an expansion beneficiary, these savings can be substantial. States can save from 15 cents to 40 cents on every dollar of care it can shift to expansion (assuming 2020 expansion match rates).\nPrior research identifies several types of expansion beneficiaries who would likely receive traditional Medicaid in the absence of expansion. Some are people who would have been covered through specific Medicaid programs, such as Section 1115 waivers or the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program. Some are people who used to spend down assets or pursue a disability designation to qualify for Medicaid that now qualify for expansion. The populations affected vary from state to state, depending on the specifics of their traditional Medicaid programs.\nWhile researchers have a clear understanding of how expansion may reduce states\u2019 traditional Medicaid spending, calculating the magnitude of these savings is difficult. In expansion states, we only observe what happened with expansion \u2014 not what these states would have spent had they not expanded Medicaid."

              "Under the \u2019s 90 percent federal reimbursement percentage, $100 of financing gimmicks yields $900 in federal funds for the state. Under the average state\u2019s 60 percent federal reimbursement for traditional Medicaid recipients, $100 of financing gimmicks yields $150 in federal funds for the state. Money laundering for spending on the expansion population thus has a rate of return six times higher for the average state\u2014and more so for wealthier states that receive lower federal reimbursements for traditional recipients.\nThe federal government\u2019s near-total subsidization of the expansion group dramatically weakens states\u2019 incentives to enforce eligibility rules. When ineligible individuals receive benefits through the expansion group, states bear almost none of the cost. On the other hand, ineligible enrollment in Medicaid allows governors and state legislators to boast of reducing the uninsured rate, expanding health coverage for their constituents, and supporting local hospitals and insurers offering Medicaid plans. In essence, state policymakers reap the political benefits of allowing large numbers of ineligible enrollees in Medicaid while federal taxpayers foot the bill.\nDifferences in federal matching rates also create strong financial motives for states to classify individuals eligible for Medicaid under traditional pathways as expansion enrollees. For example, if the annual cost for a Medicaid enrollee is $10,000, states save $3,000 per year by placing them in the expansion group with a 90 percent federal match, compared to the 60 percent match for the traditional group. Research suggests that these types of reclassifications may be widespread, affecting millions of enrollees and substantially inflating federal spending on ."

              "As the foregoing suggests, strong matching requirements are the exception rather than the rule in federal grant programs. In fact, strong matching requirements present a tradeoff to federal policy-making officials. Many grants have the objective of providing a minimum floor of services across the nation and across all states or localities. From this perspective, strong matching requirements\u2014although prompting greater deliberation and oversight by state and local officials\u2014may also serve to discourage participation by these governments, thereby frustrating the provision of uniform minimum services throughout the country. The impacts of matching on grant participation can be particularly severe for fiscally hard-pressed entities for whom raising the nonfederal share constitutes a greater burden than for wealthier jurisdictions. Federal policy makers can adjust matching rates to reflect the differential fiscal capacity across the nation by varying the matching formula or by waiving matching for certain governments. Indeed, the federal Medicaid program allocates federal funds through a matching formula that provides a higher federal share to states with lower per capita incomes, as a proxy for fiscal capacity. However, for most programs, the matching rate is either lowered or eliminated, recognizing the importance that federal policy makers place on ensuring maximum participation in grant programs."

However, the governor\u2019s proposal does not contain tax policy changes that would significantly increase state revenues to meet the level of needs existing in the state or to account for potential federal threats to vital public supports that could harm California residents as well as the state\u2019s budget.\nDuring the 2024-25 budget process, facing a large budget shortfall, state leaders enacted a that included some tax policy changes to increase state revenue, but the majority of that revenue increase was related to temporary corporate tax benefit limitations set to expire by the 2026 tax year at the latest. Overall, revenue increases made up less than 1% of the budget solutions. \nNotably, the state loses tens of billions of dollars on corporate and personal income tax breaks each year. However, these costly tax breaks are not reevaluated in budget deliberations and many continue every year without scrutiny. Some of the largest of these tax breaks largely benefit highly profitable corporations and wealthy individuals and make the state\u2019s tax system less equitable.\nThe governor\u2019s proposal includes the following tax policy proposals:"

              "The U.S. campaign finance system unfairly favors a small handful of wealthy donors. Small donor public financing could fix that.\nThere is a growing disconnect between elected officials and the majority of people they represent. Part of the blame lies with a campaign finance system that unfairly stacks the deck in favor of the few donors able to give large contributions. d and other court rulings ended decades of commonsense campaign finance laws. Now a handful of wealthy special interests dominate political funding, often through super PACs and shadowy nonprofits that shield donors\u2019 identities.\nBrennan Center for Justice has pioneered the most effective and promising solution to the problem of big money in politics: small donor public financing, a system in which public funds [match and multiply small donations](https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/small-donor-public-financing-ny). New York City\u2019s multiple match system, in which a $50 donation generates a total of $350 for the candidate, has helped reduce the influence of special interests and empower average voters, and the idea is gaining traction across the country. \nIt\u2019s easy to see why. Small donor public financing incentivizes candidates to seek out many supporters, not just a few big donors. It enables more candidates from diverse backgrounds to run and it amplifies the voices of regular people. Designed right, small donor public financing also permits candidates to raise and spend what they need to compete in the super PAC era, should they choose to opt in. And, because it doesn\u2019t restrict political spending, it stands up to the current Supreme Court\u2019s requirements. \nOther approaches to public campaign financing include voucher systems, where citizens receive certain amounts in public funds they can direct to their preferred candidates.

GAO was asked to inventory examples of alternative \napproaches that agencies have employed to finance the capital used in \ntheir operations.\n\nWhat GAO Found:\n\nCapital projects are fully funded when Congress provides budget \nauthority for the full cost of an asset up front. Such up-front \nfunding provides recognition for commitments that are embodied in \nbudgetary decisions and maintains governmentwide fiscal control. \nHowever, providing budget authority for the large up-front costs of \ncapital assets creates challenges in an era of resource constraints. \nAgencies have been authorized to use an array of approaches to obtain \ncapital assets without full, up-front budget authority.

From an agency's \nperspective, meeting capital needs through alternative financing \napproaches (i.e., not full funding) can be very attractive because the \nagency can obtain the capital asset without first having to secure \nsufficient appropriations to cover the full cost of the asset. \nDepending on the financing approach, an agency may spread the asset \ncost over a number of years or may never even incur a monetary cost \nthat is recognized in the budget. In other words, alternative financing \napproaches can make it easier for agencies to meet mission capital \ndemands within the constraints of their appropriation. As we have \nreported in the past, however, from a governmentwide perspective the \ncosts associated with these financing approaches may be greater than \nwith full, up-front budget authority. Regardless of the financing \napproach used to obtain the capital, agencies would receive the same \nprogram benefits.\n\nTable 1 below shows an array of approaches that agencies have used to \nfinance capital.\n\nTable 1: Alternative Financing Approaches:\n\nAgency: GSA; \nIncremental funding: None; \nOperating lease: PTO building; DOT headquarters; \nRetained fees: Phillip Burton Conf.

              "Community coalitions have increasingly been used as a vehicle to foster improvements in community health. A coalition is traditionally defined as \u201ca group of individuals representing diverse organizations, factions or constituencies who agree to work together to achieve a common goal\u201d (Feighery & Rogers, 1990). Community coalitions differ from other types of coalitions in that they include professional and grassroots members that are committed to working together to influence long-term health and welfare practices in their community (Butterfoss, 2007). Additionally, given their ability to leverage existing resources in the community and convene diverse organizations, community coalitions connote a type of collaboration that is considered to be sustainable over time (Butterfoss, Goodman, & Wandersman, 1993).\nFunders of community coalitions include governmental and non-governmental entities. The federal government often provides short-term initial funding to community coalitions to work toward important health goals that cannot be achieved by a single community organization. Foundations also frequently fund community coalitions and other collaborative partnerships to address key social issues. The presumption is that successful community coalitions will be able to identify new resources to continue their activities and to sustain their impacts in the community over time. Understanding the extent to which coalitions can be sustained post-funding will be important as the federal government continues to invest in innovative community-based strategies to improve the health outcomes of Americans.\n###  B. Purpose and Research Questions",
              "In addition, this literature review will serve as the foundation for developing a framework that may be used to assess the sustainability of community coalitions in the future. The conceptual framework will guide the ASPE study, which uses the experiences of the community coalitions funded by the Community Access Program (CAP)/Healthy Communities Access Program (HCAP) to explore sustainability.\nOne of the largest federal investments to strengthen local health care safety nets through community coalitions was the Community Access Program (CAP) and its successor, the Healthy Communities Access Program (HCAP). From 2000 through 2005, HCAP provided grants to local communities to strengthen the health care safety net that serves the uninsured and underinsured. Congressional funding for CAP began with a $25 million appropriation in the fiscal year (FY) 2000 budget that was used to make grants to 23 coalitions of community organizations and safety net providers. Additional funding provided to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for the program included approximately $500 million from FY 2001 through FY 2005. In total, HRSA awarded 260 grants in 45 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Funding for the program was ended in FY 2006.",
              "One of the ways in which CAP/HCAP distinguished itself from other federal safety net programs was by requiring collaboration. Namely, grants were given to consortia of local providers, rather than individual institutions. The program sought to overcome the fragmented nature of safety net care by bringing together the major players of a community and providing funds to address problems that could not be adequately addressed by individual providers or organizations. The CAP/HCAP-funded coalitions focused on activities such as service integration, expansion of the delivery system, cultural competency, provider education, community and patient education, disease detection and prevention, service integration, and new coverage plans for the uninsured, among others. \nUnderstanding the sustainability of community coalitions is particularly important today given new federal investments in clinical and community-based strategies through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. For example, $373 million of ARRA money will fund community consortia to address the leading causes of preventable death and disability under the Communities Putting Prevention to Work initiative. A more complete understanding of the factors that impede and facilitate coalition sustainability will assist successful coalitions to continue this important work after their initial federal funding ends. \nAn extensive review of the literature in the fields of public health and social sciences (particularly sociology, community psychology, and political science) was conducted in order to identify peer-reviewed articles, reports, and white papers. Boolean search techniques were utilized to conduct these searches\u2014maximizing the number of pertinent articles and minimizing extraneous material. References from relevant papers were used to identify additional sources. Exhibit 1.1 briefly summarizes the literature search strategy."

              "Political organizations possess various characteristics, such as composition, resources, objectives, strategies, and activities, which influence their functions and impact within political or governing systems at different scales. For instance, with their formal organizational structures, political parties frequently clash in electoral politics, striving to change or maintain seats of power in government, usually spanning the geography of a country and operating in the macro-political system (or, as referred to it in this article, the macro-system) (). Due to their often outsider status and informal organizational structures, social movements instead typically engage in extra-political activities like civil disobedience and demonstrations. If these activities succeed, they can draw national attention to their cause, impacting the broader macro-system as well ().\nThis article focuses on another informally structured category of political organization, namely advocacy coalitions. These are the backbone of the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), a policy process theory that studies how actors forge alliances to engage in and steer conflicts over policy and administrative issues. A defining characteristic of advocacy coalitions is that they seek to influence policy change and implementation in policy subsystems\u2014i.e., policy-specific subsets of the macro-system ().\nWhile the ACF scholarship continues to evolve and advance, opportunities always exist for further innovations and refinements. In this study, we examine and link two aspects of advocacy coalitions that have so far remained understudied: first, their involvement and mobilization at two levels of collective action (i.e., the macro-system and policy subsystems), and second, the possibility of deep core beliefs acting as the unifying force among members."

              "The cumulative evidence tends to support the propositions of the textbook Advocacy Coalition Theory. For example, empirical evidence has supported the argument for two or more stable coalitions when differences in policy core beliefs might escalate into conflict, but not without nuances and exceptions. In their study of U.S. automotive pollution control over 26 years, Zafonte and Sabatier () analyzed legislative testimonies at congressional hearings to find two advocacy coalitions, one for strict and the other for weak standards. They also observed changes in coalition composition for both coalitions and the emergence of a third coalition (pursuing moderate standards) over time. However, they also found little support for the expectation that policy core beliefs would be more stable than secondary beliefs. For studies of advocacy coalitions over time, Zafonte and Sabatier's findings are not unusual with the identification of stable coalitions with some members leaving, defecting, or joining over an extended period, and mixed results in the relative stability of the ACF's different belief system levels.\nOther studies have explored the mechanisms of coalition stability. For example, studies have examined how the devil shift contributes to coalition stability. Kingiri () used multiple methods (e.g., interviews and documents) to examine the biosafety subsystem in Kenya and found that the devil shift contributed to sustaining an advocacy coalition and limiting learning between coalitions."

State-led collaborative engagements with civil society are longstanding and substantive (Evans, ; Ostrom, ). Political parties have sought alliances with civil society to strengthen new approaches to longstanding political and governance challenges (Hickey & Sen, ; Houtzager & Moore, ). Turning to city examples, Guti\u00e9rrez et al. () analyse how non-aligned politicians have used these approaches to reduce urban violence in Colombia: \nThe \u2018miracles\u2019 cannot be understood without dealing with urban politics and in particular with the ability of innovative politicians to successfully create viable transformational coalitions within the city. [\u2026] By comparing the differing trajectories of Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn, on the one hand, and Cali, on the other, we can focus on how and why coalitions make a difference. (p. 3136)\nGaventa and McGee () argue that \u2018alliances between social actors and champions of change inside the state are critical to make policy change happen\u2019 (p. 24). But policy changes that favour low-income groups are tricky to secure and hard to maintain. Brazilian policy councils were initiated to provide \u2018institutionalised spaces mediating among civil society organizations, city dwellers and the state\u2019 and councils used the enhanced participatory processes under the 1998 constitution to improve inclusion (Pimentel Walker & Friendly, , p. 436). However, a study in the two cities of S\u00e3o Paulo and Niter\u00f3i highlights that, although the councils have acted very much as multi-stakeholder coalitions (in terms of the definition given above), and have helped to address poverty through regularizing informal neighbourhoods, they have been used by real estate interests to marginalize low-income groups and secure municipal support for private-sector inner-city redevelopment (Pimentel Walker & Friendly, ).",
              "The interest of urban social movements in coalitions appears well founded. Evidence suggests that civil society state coalitions may support reform, making cities more politically inclusive, with more equitable outcomes. Coalitions have the potential to encourage cross-class collaboration (McAdam et al., ; Nelson, ), and improve democratic governance (Gaventa & McGee, ; McAdam et al., ). Coalitions appear to be effective \u2013 at least in part \u2013 because they change elite positions and priorities through deepening their understanding (framing) of disadvantaged groups (McAdam et al., ), resulting in more favourable politics (even if they are seen as oppositional groups) (Iraz\u00e1bal, ; Mouffe, ; Ramirez et al., ; Stone, ).",
              "Coalitional politics is being used by multiple urban social movements \u2013 and agencies that support their work \u2013 to address the scale and nature of disadvantage in towns and cities of the Global South. To advance our understanding about how coalitions might form and function effectively, this paper introduces and analyses four diverse exemplars that illustrate the approaches used. We find that coalitions have the potential to improve the relational capital of disadvantaged residents, increasing the legitimacy of their claims, advancing their interests and leading to pro-poor reforms. Coalitions enhance existing political opportunities and potentially improve the political opportunity structure. However, context matters, particularly the nature and extent of local democracy, and coalitions must operate in a space that is circumscribed and contested.\n\u6539\u9769\u8054\u76df\u5bf9\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8d21\u732e: \u57ce\u5e02\u793e\u4f1a\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u6559\u8bad\u3002. \u591a\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u793e\u4f1a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u90a3\u4e9b\u652f\u6301\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u673a\u6784, \u6b63\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8054\u76df\u653f\u6cbb\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u57ce\u9547\u4e2d\u52a3\u52bf\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u672c\u8d28\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u52a0\u6df1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8054\u76df\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u4f5c\u5730\u7406\u89e3, \u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u5e76\u4e14\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u793a\u4f8b, \u4ee5\u8bf4\u660e\u6240\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e, \u8054\u76df\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u6539\u5584\u5f31\u52bf\u5c45\u6c11\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8d44\u672c, \u589e\u52a0\u5176\u8bc9\u6c42\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u6027, \u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u5229\u76ca, \u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u7a77\u4eba\u7684\u6539\u9769\u3002\u6b64\u5916, \u8054\u76df\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u673a\u4f1a, \u5e76\u5177\u5907\u6539\u5584\u653f\u6cbb\u673a\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c, \u80cc\u666f\u5f88\u91cd\u8981, \u7279\u522b\u662f\u5730\u65b9\u6c11\u4e3b\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6, \u8054\u76df\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002"

              "Political feasibility is at the center of air-pollution policymaking in the developing world, affecting both the choices of policies and their implementation outcomes. Using India as a test case, we demonstrate how political considerations (e.g., public opinion, market structure, and government capacity) can be incorporated into quantitative models for environmental impact assessment. By examining a wide range of clean-air policies across the electricity, industrial, transportation, residential, and agricultural sectors, we find that policies with a great potential to mitigate air pollution can have varying degrees of political feasibility. Because some lower-feasibility policies also co-reduce carbon emissions (e.g., phasing out existing coal units), considering the effects of political feasibility is particularly important in achieving air-pollution and climate objectives simultaneously.",
              "Political-feasibility concerns are at the center of real-world air-pollution policymaking. Yet, these concerns are often not represented in leading decision-support tools that have been used for assessing policies' environmental impacts. Focusing on a wide range of clean-air policies in India, we assess their political-feasibility scores on the basis of public opinion, market, and institutional considerations and then incorporate these scores into the evaluation of environmental impacts by using an integrated assessment model (GAINS-South Asia). We demonstrate that although some policies with substantial potential to mitigate air pollution are also highly politically feasible (e.g., replacing solid fuels with cleaner fuels in households), others can be less politically feasible (e.g., banning agricultural waste burning). Because some clean-air policies co-reduce CO emissions and aerosols, considering varying degrees of political feasibility is particularly important in achieving air-pollution and climate objectives simultaneously because of its implications on the implementation scale and policy sequence."

              "Most earlier studies addressing factors contributing to Medicare costs (mostly defined as government payments) rely on relationships among geographic area means (e.g., ; [Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences 1999](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3165175/#b5); ;). Area-based analyses are particularly prone to bias from unmeasured demand or supply factors likely to confound relationships among area averages (Zuckerman et al. 2010). Moreover, beneficiaries within geographic areas are likely to have heterogeneous characteristics, within-area distributions of variables are likely to vary considerably across areas, and often will not be normally distributed (e.g., health status). As a result, associations among area means and ratios will likely deviate from those that would be estimated at the individual patient level (). Consequently, we estimate determinants of Medicare expenditures (costs) at the beneficiary level.\nAlthough no study can avoid specification bias by including all relevant variables, our study investigates a substantial number of both demand and supply-side variables, many of which were not included in previous work. Finally, we compare factors contributing to the costs of treating two sets of Medicare beneficiaries, based on their expected medical costs. It is important to understand how potential effects differ, because the factors that drive the utilization of high-cost beneficiaries are of greatest policy import.",
              "The 2006 average standardized medical cost for predicted high-cost beneficiaries was nearly U.S.$48,000, compared with about U.S.$7,000 for predicted low-cost patients (). (Median values were U.S.$37,704 and U.S.$3,406, respectively.) Overall, 69 percent of total costs were spent on the 25 percent classified as predicted high-cost beneficiaries. This is lower than the 85 percent typically reported for the 25 percent most costly beneficiaries because of our inability to perfectly predict high and low-cost users, the fact that we are using standardized costs, which truncates some outlier cases, and the exclusion of beneficiaries who received no Medicare services. Medicare payments were a higher percentage of total standardized costs among high-cost beneficiaries (88 versus 82 percent), reflecting greater use of Part A services. For instance, 79 and 84 percent of expenditures on hospitals and postacute care were incurred by predicted high-cost beneficiaries, respectively, compared with about 50 percent of physician service and outpatient costs. Inpatient and postacute care accounted for 63 percent of total costs of predicted high-cost beneficiaries, as compared with 34 percent for predicted low-cost beneficiaries.\nAnnual Standardized Costs and Medicare Payments among Predicted High- and Low-Cost Medicare Beneficiaries  \nMean Costs, Given Any Use | % of Total Costsin Category | Mean Costs, Given Any Use | % of Total Costs in Category | % of Costs Incurred by Predicted High-Cost Beneficiaries  \n\u201cOther\u201d includes clinical lab services, durable medical equipment, Part B drugs, hospice care, psychiatric facility care, and long-term care hospital care.\npresents multivariable results for predicted high-and low-cost beneficiaries. Along with model coefficients, we assess variables' relative importance by reporting elasticities for continuous variables and the coefficient as a percent of mean standardized costs for categorical variables.",
              "The Medicare fee difference variable generated the largest elasticities. Consistent with our hypothesis and previous research, higher relative fees are associated with greater service provision (; ;). The estimated elasticity is larger (0.41) among low-cost beneficiaries than among high-cost beneficiaries (0.23), suggesting physicians may exercise greater discretion in the treatment of healthier beneficiaries.\nAlthough models estimated over the entire sample of low- and high-cost patients explain two-thirds of the variation in beneficiaries' medical costs, several limitations should be noted. First, causal inferences should be made cautiously because the data are cross-sectional. Second, unobserved heterogeneity in the beneficiary population could be correlated with model variables and bias coefficients. Third, available data limit our ability to characterize all key features of local health care markets (e.g., level of care coordination). Fourth, there is no definitive way to define local healthcare markets and our use of counties for most market variables is driven by available data. Finally, the sample is only approximately representative of the elderly, non-ESRD Medicare beneficiaries because it excludes Medicare Advantage enrollees, new enrollees, and beneficiaries because use no physician services over an extended time period, and it uses an indirect sampling method.\nA final limitation is that our study focused only on costs, without considering effects on outcomes (for which claims data are not particularly suited). Though not reported here, we constructed mortality and ambulatory sensitive hospitalization rates (which are analyzed in another study). We did attempt to identify factors that were efficiency enhancing or diminishing by estimating parallel reduced-form models, but the results were ambiguous."

              "To measure this concept, one must measure costs, select appropriate outcome measures, determine whether and how to combine them, and compare state scores. Based on the methods used in the studies reviewed, a three-phased approach is recommended. First, MPR proposes to construct measures of costs per enrollee, stratified by enrollee categories. We also propose to standardize or adjust costs for factors that influence variation in state Medicaid spending that are clearly beyond state Medicaid agency control. Second, MPR would examine quality and access to care measures for which data is available across all or most states to assess whether variation in outcomes and variation in costs appear to be linked. Because the literature provides less guidance for Medicaid quality and other outcome measurement than for expenditure analyses, we will continue to seek input on appropriate outcome measures to be used. Third, MPR will assess alternate ways to rank and compare state performance on cost and outcome measures.\n##  Measuring Medicaid Spending and Costs\nCalculating per enrollee cost measures that support accurate cross-state comparisons requires several technical decisions, including: (1) how to stratify Medicaid enrollees to create reasonably similar comparison groups, (2) whether to examine costs for specific services and if so, how to identify service costs for enrollees in managed care plans, (3) whether to include or exclude costs that cannot be attributed to individual enrollees, such as administrative costs and disproportionate share hospital payments, and (4) how to adjust for factors that are beyond the control of state Medicaid agencies.",
              "Since the proportion of total enrollees in these groups varies by state, we could: (1) examine per enrollee expenditures separately for each of the subgroups, or (2) present only group-level (for example, aged) per enrollee expenditures, but standardize the measures so the proportion of enrollees within each subgroup (for example, aged/dual eligible, aged/not dual eligible) is held constant in assessing overall group level per enrollee expenditures. Because limited-benefit enrollees (for example, adults qualifying only for family planning services) account for a small proportion of Medicaid spending and receive very few services, we do not recommend including them in analyses of per enrollee expenditures.\nService Costs and Medicaid Managed Care. Measures of efficiency often focus on cost per unit of service. In the Medicaid context, this would mean comparing spending per enrollee for discrete service categories, such as hospital inpatient care, prescription drugs, nursing home care, and physician visits. But lower cost per service does not necessarily produce higher value in terms of better quality or other outcomes. In addition, from the purchaser\u2019s perspective, efficiency could result from a different of services provided to enrollees, which argues against analyzing costs at the unit of service level.",
              "For these reasons, we recommend (1) measuring state Medicaid spending for population subgroups for two broad categories of services---acute care and long-term-care---rather than for specific services, and (2) combining fee-for-service (FFS) and managed care populations in each of these two service categories, to the extent that enrollees in managed care organizations (MCOs) can be divided into those receiving primarily acute care versus long-term care services. This higher level of aggregation should produce useful comparisons across states about the efficiency or value obtained through the mix of services provided, and through greater or lesser use of capitated or other forms of managed care compared to fee-for-service payment and delivery models. It is also a practical decision; limitations in the availability of service-specific expenditure data for Medicaid managed care enrollees, whose care is paid on a capitation basis, would restrict detailed comparisons of per-service costs to a small subset of states with little managed care enrollment, or to the long-term care sector where managed care is not as prevalent.\n. Numerous studies and reports highlight large variation in the amount and proportion of total state Medicaid spending on DSH expenditures. However, since DSH payments, and other payments cannot be attributed to individual Medicaid enrollees, and DSH payments cover the cost of care for non-Medicaid, indigent individuals, we do not recommend including these costs in our analysis."

The broad rationale for estimating the marginal cost per unit of health produced by the healthcare system in these reviewed studies was to guide health funding decisions. Where the true opportunity cost is unknown, that is, when decisions to fund a new health technology or intervention do not specify what is to be forgone, then an empirical estimate can provide the next best option to quantify the net health impact."

For each constraint, propose a concise mitigation or sequencing recommendation (e.g., start with pilot rollouts, frontload workforce investment) and cite node_3.\n- Note the expected administrative overhead and phasing costs (use cost figures from node_2 where available and implementation evidence from node_3).\n\n7) Political strategy linkage\n- For each financing + service pairing (from step 4), give a short recommended political strategy drawn from node_3: coalition-building priorities, successful framing examples, likely opponents and mitigation tactics, and whether incremental or comprehensive approaches are advised (cite node_3).\n- Produce a \u201cfeasibility scorecard\u201d (qualitative) that tags each pairing as: \u201cLikely feasible with moderate effort\u201d, \u201cFeasible but politically costly\u201d, or \u201cLow feasibility\u201d \u2014 base the tag on node_3 evidence and note assumptions.\n\n8) Final prioritized recommendations (short list)\n- Produce a short prioritized list (3\u20136 bullets) recommending near-term policy packages or sequencing choices that balance fiscal realism and political feasibility. For each recommendation:\n  a) State which services are included.\n  b) State the proposed financing mix (from node_2).\n  c) Give expected net cost and distributional effect (node_2).\n  d) Provide political justification and recommended tactics (node_3).\n  e) Note primary implementation actions and timing (node_3).\n- For traceability, append in parentheses the child nodes used for fiscal vs. political parts (e.g., \u201c(costs: node_2; politics: node_3)\u201d).\n\n9) Uncertainties, data gaps, and further analysis\n- List the main uncertainties and evidence gaps exposed when combining node_2 and node_3 (identify which node provided the incomplete or divergent information). Recommend specific follow-up analyses (e.g., microsimulation of distributional impacts, pilot implementation studies, updated cost curves).\n\n10) Format and traceability rules\n- The parent output must be a list. Each top-level bullet should be a self-contained item (service synthesis, financing option, scenario, or recommendation). Within each bullet, use short sub-bullets for numbers, trade\u2011offs, and political/implementation notes.\n- For every numeric estimate, distributional claim, political claim, or implementation constraint, include an inline parenthetical reference to the originating child node id: use \u201c(node_2)\u201d for fiscal/empirical items and \u201c(node_3)\u201d for political/implementation items. If a statement integrates evidence from both children, include both references (e.g., \u201c(node_2; node_3)\u201d).\n- Where you perform calculations (summing costs, netting offsets, computing % GDP), show the simple arithmetic as part of the list item and indicate that the inputs came from node_2 (e.g., \u201cTotal net cost = sum of A ($X, node_2) + B ($Y, node_2) \u2013 offsets ($Z, node_2) = $W\u201d).\n- End with a concise, 2\u20133 bullet executive summary that states: aggregate fiscal scale, top 2\u20133 policy recommendations, and overall political feasibility judgement\u2014each bullet citing node_2 and node_3 as appropriate.\n\nDo not introduce external evidence beyond node_2 and node_3. If node_2 or node_3 lack specific numbers or clear conclusions needed for a step, explicitly note that as a gap and attribute it to the relevant node.",

              "### Governor Proposes No Major Revenue Increases, But Expands Film Tax Break\nGiven the many challenges Californians face with the costs of living and the many unmet needs in the state, policymakers will need to substantially raise ongoing revenues to ensure that state residents can make ends meet. However, the governor\u2019s proposal does not contain tax policy changes that would significantly increase state revenues to meet the level of needs existing in the state or to account for potential federal threats to vital public supports that could harm California residents as well as the state\u2019s budget.\nDuring the 2024-25 budget process, facing a large budget shortfall, state leaders enacted a that included some tax policy changes to increase state revenue, but the majority of that revenue increase was related to temporary corporate tax benefit limitations set to expire by the 2026 tax year at the latest. Overall, revenue increases made up less than 1% of the budget solutions. \nNotably, the state loses tens of billions of dollars on corporate and personal income tax breaks each year. However, these costly tax breaks are not reevaluated in budget deliberations and many continue every year without scrutiny. Some of the largest of these tax breaks largely benefit highly profitable corporations and wealthy individuals and make the state\u2019s tax system less equitable.\nThe governor\u2019s proposal includes the following tax policy proposals:"

The public funding program was designed to use tax dollars to:\n  * Match the first $250 of each from individuals that an eligible presidential candidate receives during the primary campaign; and\n  * Fund the nominees' general election campaigns (and assist eligible nominees).",
              "candidates and candidates may become eligible for partial public funding of their general election campaigns. A minor party candidate is the nominee of a party whose candidate received between five and 25 percent of the total popular vote in the preceding presidential election. The amount of public funding to which a minor party candidate is entitled is based on the ratio of the party's popular vote in the preceding presidential election to the average popular vote of the two major party candidates in that election. A new party candidate receives partial public funding after the election if he or she receives five percent or more of the vote. The entitlement is based on the ratio of the new party candidate's popular vote in the current election to the average popular vote of the two major party candidates in the election.\nOnce the FEC determines that a candidate has met the eligibility requirements, it certifies the amount of public funds to which the candidate is entitled. The U.S. Treasury then makes the payments using funds from the $3 tax checkoff.\nThe 1040 federal income tax form asks taxpayers whether they'd like to designate $3 of their taxes paid to the . When taxpayers check \"yes,\" three of their tax dollars are placed in the Fund. Checking the \"yes\" box does not increase the amount of tax that taxpayers owe, nor does it decrease any refund to which they are entitled. The tax checkoff is the sole source of funds for the public funding program.\nThe that receive public funds for either the primary or general election. Candidates may owe a repayment to the Treasury if they used public funds to defray non-campaign related expenses, exceeded the expenditure limits, maintained a surplus of public funds, or received more public funds than they were entitled to receive.\n  * Monthly reports from the Dept. of Treasury of balance available for Presidential Election Campaign Fund: | | | | | | | | |"

              "Public financing is the most effective solution we have to the problem of big money in politics. \n\nAfter its successful start in 2024, a large majority of voters across parties want state leaders to keep funding New York\u2019s small donor public financing program.\nSeattle voters will decide on Tuesday whether to renew funding for a voucher program that has made running for office more accessible there. \n\n###  Informed citizens are democracy\u2019s best defense",
              "The U.S. campaign finance system unfairly favors a small handful of wealthy donors. Small donor public financing could fix that.\nThere is a growing disconnect between elected officials and the majority of people they represent. Part of the blame lies with a campaign finance system that unfairly stacks the deck in favor of the few donors able to give large contributions. d and other court rulings ended decades of commonsense campaign finance laws. Now a handful of wealthy special interests dominate political funding, often through super PACs and shadowy nonprofits that shield donors\u2019 identities.\nBrennan Center for Justice has pioneered the most effective and promising solution to the problem of big money in politics: small donor public financing, a system in which public funds [match and multiply small donations](https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/small-donor-public-financing-ny). New York City\u2019s multiple match system, in which a $50 donation generates a total of $350 for the candidate, has helped reduce the influence of special interests and empower average voters, and the idea is gaining traction across the country. \nIt\u2019s easy to see why. Small donor public financing incentivizes candidates to seek out many supporters, not just a few big donors. It enables more candidates from diverse backgrounds to run and it amplifies the voices of regular people. Designed right, small donor public financing also permits candidates to raise and spend what they need to compete in the super PAC era, should they choose to opt in. And, because it doesn\u2019t restrict political spending, it stands up to the current Supreme Court\u2019s requirements. \nOther approaches to public campaign financing include voucher systems, where citizens receive certain amounts in public funds they can direct to their preferred candidates. Tax credits for small campaign donations are another way to encourage more people to participate.\n#### Boost Public Funding of Elections"

              "In an era of limited resources and growing mission demands, many \nagencies have turned to approaches other than full up-front funding to \nfinance capital. GAO was asked to inventory examples of alternative \napproaches that agencies have employed to finance the capital used in \ntheir operations.\n\nWhat GAO Found:\n\nCapital projects are fully funded when Congress provides budget \nauthority for the full cost of an asset up front. Such up-front \nfunding provides recognition for commitments that are embodied in \nbudgetary decisions and maintains governmentwide fiscal control. \nHowever, providing budget authority for the large up-front costs of \ncapital assets creates challenges in an era of resource constraints. \nAgencies have been authorized to use an array of approaches to obtain \ncapital assets without full, up-front budget authority. Our work \nidentified 10 alternative financing approaches used by one or more of \n13 agencies. These approaches, which are described in our letter, \n\n* incremental funding,\n* operating leases,\n* retained fees,\n* real property swaps, \n* sale-leasebacks,\n* lease-leasebacks,\n* public private partnerships,\n* outleases,\n* share-in-savings contracts, and\n* debt issuance.",
              "We identified 10 capital financing approaches that have been used by \none or more of 13 federal agencies (see table 1). From an agency's \nperspective, meeting capital needs through alternative financing \napproaches (i.e., not full funding) can be very attractive because the \nagency can obtain the capital asset without first having to secure \nsufficient appropriations to cover the full cost of the asset. \nDepending on the financing approach, an agency may spread the asset \ncost over a number of years or may never even incur a monetary cost \nthat is recognized in the budget. In other words, alternative financing \napproaches can make it easier for agencies to meet mission capital \ndemands within the constraints of their appropriation. As we have \nreported in the past, however, from a governmentwide perspective the \ncosts associated with these financing approaches may be greater than \nwith full, up-front budget authority. Regardless of the financing \napproach used to obtain the capital, agencies would receive the same \nprogram benefits.\n\nTable 1 below shows an array of approaches that agencies have used to \nfinance capital.\n\nTable 1: Alternative Financing Approaches:\n\nAgency: GSA; \nIncremental funding: None; \nOperating lease: PTO building; DOT headquarters; \nRetained fees: Phillip Burton Conf. Center; \nReal property swaps: Albuquerque, NM, federal building and parking; L. \nMendel Rivers Building; \nSale-leaseback: Charleston, WV Federal Building; \nLease-leaseback: None; \nPublic private partnerships: Southeast Federal Center; El Paso border \nstation; Ronald Reagan Building; Atlanta Food Court; \nOutlease: Tariff Bldg.; McCormack PO Courthouse; Galveston \ncustomhouse; RRB bldg.; Metcalfe Building; \nShare-in-savings: Energy savings performance contracts ($100s of \nmillions in total); \nDebt issuance: None.",
              "Sale-leaseback (1 case) - Under a sale-leaseback agreement, a federal \nagency sells an asset and then leases back some or all of the asset \nfrom the purchaser.\n\nLease-leaseback (1 case) - A lease-leaseback agreement between a \ngovernment agency and a private entity may consist of three stages: the \ngovernment agency purchases an asset; the agency then leases out the \nsame asset to a private entity for a fixed time period in return for a \nlump sum payment; finally the agency leases back the use of the same \n\nPublic private partnerships (54 arrangements) - Public private \npartnerships tap the capital and expertise of the private sector to \nimprove or redevelop federal real property assets. Ideally, the \npartnerships are designed so that each participant makes complementary \ncontributions that offer benefits to all parties.\n\nOutleases (36 cases) - Excess or underused properties are outleased to \nshift the cost of maintenance and restoration to the private sector \nlessee, thus relieving the federal government of these expenses.\n\nShare-in-savings contracts (hundreds of millions of dollars) - Some \nfederal agencies work with contractors who purchase and install new \nenergy systems in federal buildings. Agencies then pay back the \ncontractors over time for the equipment plus a percentage of the energy \ncosts saved as a result of the more efficient energy systems and relief \nof in-house maintenance costs.\n\nDebt issuance (1 agency) -A few federal organizations, such as the \nTennessee Valley Authority, have authority to borrow from the public. \nThis authority can be used to finance capital acquisitions.\n\nOrganization of Report:\n\nThe remainder of this report consists of sections on each of the above \nfinancing approaches.

              "Community coalitions have increasingly been used as a vehicle to foster improvements in community health. A coalition is traditionally defined as \u201ca group of individuals representing diverse organizations, factions or constituencies who agree to work together to achieve a common goal\u201d (Feighery & Rogers, 1990). Community coalitions differ from other types of coalitions in that they include professional and grassroots members that are committed to working together to influence long-term health and welfare practices in their community (Butterfoss, 2007). Additionally, given their ability to leverage existing resources in the community and convene diverse organizations, community coalitions connote a type of collaboration that is considered to be sustainable over time (Butterfoss, Goodman, & Wandersman, 1993).\nFunders of community coalitions include governmental and non-governmental entities. The federal government often provides short-term initial funding to community coalitions to work toward important health goals that cannot be achieved by a single community organization. Foundations also frequently fund community coalitions and other collaborative partnerships to address key social issues. The presumption is that successful community coalitions will be able to identify new resources to continue their activities and to sustain their impacts in the community over time. Understanding the extent to which coalitions can be sustained post-funding will be important as the federal government continues to invest in innovative community-based strategies to improve the health outcomes of Americans.\n###  B. Purpose and Research Questions",
              "In addition, this literature review will serve as the foundation for developing a framework that may be used to assess the sustainability of community coalitions in the future. The conceptual framework will guide the ASPE study, which uses the experiences of the community coalitions funded by the Community Access Program (CAP)/Healthy Communities Access Program (HCAP) to explore sustainability.\nOne of the largest federal investments to strengthen local health care safety nets through community coalitions was the Community Access Program (CAP) and its successor, the Healthy Communities Access Program (HCAP). From 2000 through 2005, HCAP provided grants to local communities to strengthen the health care safety net that serves the uninsured and underinsured. Congressional funding for CAP began with a $25 million appropriation in the fiscal year (FY) 2000 budget that was used to make grants to 23 coalitions of community organizations and safety net providers. Additional funding provided to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) for the program included approximately $500 million from FY 2001 through FY 2005. In total, HRSA awarded 260 grants in 45 states plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Funding for the program was ended in FY 2006.",
              "One of the ways in which CAP/HCAP distinguished itself from other federal safety net programs was by requiring collaboration. Namely, grants were given to consortia of local providers, rather than individual institutions. The program sought to overcome the fragmented nature of safety net care by bringing together the major players of a community and providing funds to address problems that could not be adequately addressed by individual providers or organizations. The CAP/HCAP-funded coalitions focused on activities such as service integration, expansion of the delivery system, cultural competency, provider education, community and patient education, disease detection and prevention, service integration, and new coverage plans for the uninsured, among others. \nUnderstanding the sustainability of community coalitions is particularly important today given new federal investments in clinical and community-based strategies through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. For example, $373 million of ARRA money will fund community consortia to address the leading causes of preventable death and disability under the Communities Putting Prevention to Work initiative. A more complete understanding of the factors that impede and facilitate coalition sustainability will assist successful coalitions to continue this important work after their initial federal funding ends. \nAn extensive review of the literature in the fields of public health and social sciences (particularly sociology, community psychology, and political science) was conducted in order to identify peer-reviewed articles, reports, and white papers. Boolean search techniques were utilized to conduct these searches\u2014maximizing the number of pertinent articles and minimizing extraneous material. References from relevant papers were used to identify additional sources. Exhibit 1.1 briefly summarizes the literature search strategy."

              "Political organizations possess various characteristics, such as composition, resources, objectives, strategies, and activities, which influence their functions and impact within political or governing systems at different scales. For instance, with their formal organizational structures, political parties frequently clash in electoral politics, striving to change or maintain seats of power in government, usually spanning the geography of a country and operating in the macro-political system (or, as referred to it in this article, the macro-system) (). Due to their often outsider status and informal organizational structures, social movements instead typically engage in extra-political activities like civil disobedience and demonstrations. If these activities succeed, they can draw national attention to their cause, impacting the broader macro-system as well ().\nThis article focuses on another informally structured category of political organization, namely advocacy coalitions. These are the backbone of the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF), a policy process theory that studies how actors forge alliances to engage in and steer conflicts over policy and administrative issues. A defining characteristic of advocacy coalitions is that they seek to influence policy change and implementation in policy subsystems\u2014i.e., policy-specific subsets of the macro-system ().\nWhile the ACF scholarship continues to evolve and advance, opportunities always exist for further innovations and refinements. In this study, we examine and link two aspects of advocacy coalitions that have so far remained understudied: first, their involvement and mobilization at two levels of collective action (i.e., the macro-system and policy subsystems), and second, the possibility of deep core beliefs acting as the unifying force among members."

              "The cumulative evidence tends to support the propositions of the textbook Advocacy Coalition Theory. For example, empirical evidence has supported the argument for two or more stable coalitions when differences in policy core beliefs might escalate into conflict, but not without nuances and exceptions. In their study of U.S. automotive pollution control over 26 years, Zafonte and Sabatier () analyzed legislative testimonies at congressional hearings to find two advocacy coalitions, one for strict and the other for weak standards. They also observed changes in coalition composition for both coalitions and the emergence of a third coalition (pursuing moderate standards) over time. However, they also found little support for the expectation that policy core beliefs would be more stable than secondary beliefs. For studies of advocacy coalitions over time, Zafonte and Sabatier's findings are not unusual with the identification of stable coalitions with some members leaving, defecting, or joining over an extended period, and mixed results in the relative stability of the ACF's different belief system levels.\nOther studies have explored the mechanisms of coalition stability. For example, studies have examined how the devil shift contributes to coalition stability. Kingiri () used multiple methods (e.g., interviews and documents) to examine the biosafety subsystem in Kenya and found that the devil shift contributed to sustaining an advocacy coalition and limiting learning between coalitions."

              "### 2.2. State-created coalition opportunities\nCoalitions may also be initiated by those within the state who are seeking to advantage low-income marginalized groups. State-led collaborative engagements with civil society are longstanding and substantive (Evans, ; Ostrom, ). Political parties have sought alliances with civil society to strengthen new approaches to longstanding political and governance challenges (Hickey & Sen, ; Houtzager & Moore, ). Turning to city examples, Guti\u00e9rrez et al. () analyse how non-aligned politicians have used these approaches to reduce urban violence in Colombia: \nThe \u2018miracles\u2019 cannot be understood without dealing with urban politics and in particular with the ability of innovative politicians to successfully create viable transformational coalitions within the city. [\u2026] By comparing the differing trajectories of Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn, on the one hand, and Cali, on the other, we can focus on how and why coalitions make a difference. (p. 3136)\nGaventa and McGee () argue that \u2018alliances between social actors and champions of change inside the state are critical to make policy change happen\u2019 (p. 24). But policy changes that favour low-income groups are tricky to secure and hard to maintain. Brazilian policy councils were initiated to provide \u2018institutionalised spaces mediating among civil society organizations, city dwellers and the state\u2019 and councils used the enhanced participatory processes under the 1998 constitution to improve inclusion (Pimentel Walker & Friendly, , p. 436). However, a study in the two cities of S\u00e3o Paulo and Niter\u00f3i highlights that, although the councils have acted very much as multi-stakeholder coalitions (in terms of the definition given above), and have helped to address poverty through regularizing informal neighbourhoods, they have been used by real estate interests to marginalize low-income groups and secure municipal support for private-sector inner-city redevelopment (Pimentel Walker & Friendly, ).",
              "The interest of urban social movements in coalitions appears well founded. Evidence suggests that civil society state coalitions may support reform, making cities more politically inclusive, with more equitable outcomes. Coalitions have the potential to encourage cross-class collaboration (McAdam et al., ; Nelson, ), and improve democratic governance (Gaventa & McGee, ; McAdam et al., ). Coalitions appear to be effective \u2013 at least in part \u2013 because they change elite positions and priorities through deepening their understanding (framing) of disadvantaged groups (McAdam et al., ), resulting in more favourable politics (even if they are seen as oppositional groups) (Iraz\u00e1bal, ; Mouffe, ; Ramirez et al., ; Stone, ).",
              "Coalitional politics is being used by multiple urban social movements \u2013 and agencies that support their work \u2013 to address the scale and nature of disadvantage in towns and cities of the Global South. To advance our understanding about how coalitions might form and function effectively, this paper introduces and analyses four diverse exemplars that illustrate the approaches used. We find that coalitions have the potential to improve the relational capital of disadvantaged residents, increasing the legitimacy of their claims, advancing their interests and leading to pro-poor reforms. Coalitions enhance existing political opportunities and potentially improve the political opportunity structure.

              "Political feasibility is at the center of air-pollution policymaking in the developing world, affecting both the choices of policies and their implementation outcomes. Using India as a test case, we demonstrate how political considerations (e.g., public opinion, market structure, and government capacity) can be incorporated into quantitative models for environmental impact assessment. By examining a wide range of clean-air policies across the electricity, industrial, transportation, residential, and agricultural sectors, we find that policies with a great potential to mitigate air pollution can have varying degrees of political feasibility. Because some lower-feasibility policies also co-reduce carbon emissions (e.g., phasing out existing coal units), considering the effects of political feasibility is particularly important in achieving air-pollution and climate objectives simultaneously.",
              "Political-feasibility concerns are at the center of real-world air-pollution policymaking. Yet, these concerns are often not represented in leading decision-support tools that have been used for assessing policies' environmental impacts. Focusing on a wide range of clean-air policies in India, we assess their political-feasibility scores on the basis of public opinion, market, and institutional considerations and then incorporate these scores into the evaluation of environmental impacts by using an integrated assessment model (GAINS-South Asia). We demonstrate that although some policies with substantial potential to mitigate air pollution are also highly politically feasible (e.g., replacing solid fuels with cleaner fuels in households), others can be less politically feasible (e.g., banning agricultural waste burning). Because some clean-air policies co-reduce CO emissions and aerosols, considering varying degrees of political feasibility is particularly important in achieving air-pollution and climate objectives simultaneously because of its implications on the implementation scale and policy sequence."

              "Most earlier studies addressing factors contributing to Medicare costs (mostly defined as government payments) rely on relationships among geographic area means (e.g., ; [Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences 1999](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3165175/#b5); ;). Area-based analyses are particularly prone to bias from unmeasured demand or supply factors likely to confound relationships among area averages (Zuckerman et al. 2010). Moreover, beneficiaries within geographic areas are likely to have heterogeneous characteristics, within-area distributions of variables are likely to vary considerably across areas, and often will not be normally distributed (e.g., health status). As a result, associations among area means and ratios will likely deviate from those that would be estimated at the individual patient level (). Consequently, we estimate determinants of Medicare expenditures (costs) at the beneficiary level.\nAlthough no study can avoid specification bias by including all relevant variables, our study investigates a substantial number of both demand and supply-side variables, many of which were not included in previous work. Finally, we compare factors contributing to the costs of treating two sets of Medicare beneficiaries, based on their expected medical costs. It is important to understand how potential effects differ, because the factors that drive the utilization of high-cost beneficiaries are of greatest policy import.",
              "The 2006 average standardized medical cost for predicted high-cost beneficiaries was nearly U.S.$48,000, compared with about U.S.$7,000 for predicted low-cost patients (). (Median values were U.S.$37,704 and U.S.$3,406, respectively.) Overall, 69 percent of total costs were spent on the 25 percent classified as predicted high-cost beneficiaries. This is lower than the 85 percent typically reported for the 25 percent most costly beneficiaries because of our inability to perfectly predict high and low-cost users, the fact that we are using standardized costs, which truncates some outlier cases, and the exclusion of beneficiaries who received no Medicare services. Medicare payments were a higher percentage of total standardized costs among high-cost beneficiaries (88 versus 82 percent), reflecting greater use of Part A services. For instance, 79 and 84 percent of expenditures on hospitals and postacute care were incurred by predicted high-cost beneficiaries, respectively, compared with about 50 percent of physician service and outpatient costs. Inpatient and postacute care accounted for 63 percent of total costs of predicted high-cost beneficiaries, as compared with 34 percent for predicted low-cost beneficiaries.\nAnnual Standardized Costs and Medicare Payments among Predicted High- and Low-Cost Medicare Beneficiaries  \nMean Costs, Given Any Use | % of Total Costsin Category | Mean Costs, Given Any Use | % of Total Costs in Category | % of Costs Incurred by Predicted High-Cost Beneficiaries  \n\u201cOther\u201d includes clinical lab services, durable medical equipment, Part B drugs, hospice care, psychiatric facility care, and long-term care hospital care.\npresents multivariable results for predicted high-and low-cost beneficiaries. Along with model coefficients, we assess variables' relative importance by reporting elasticities for continuous variables and the coefficient as a percent of mean standardized costs for categorical variables.",
              "The Medicare fee difference variable generated the largest elasticities. Consistent with our hypothesis and previous research, higher relative fees are associated with greater service provision (; ;). The estimated elasticity is larger (0.41) among low-cost beneficiaries than among high-cost beneficiaries (0.23), suggesting physicians may exercise greater discretion in the treatment of healthier beneficiaries.\nAlthough models estimated over the entire sample of low- and high-cost patients explain two-thirds of the variation in beneficiaries' medical costs, several limitations should be noted. First, causal inferences should be made cautiously because the data are cross-sectional. Second, unobserved heterogeneity in the beneficiary population could be correlated with model variables and bias coefficients. Third, available data limit our ability to characterize all key features of local health care markets (e.g., level of care coordination). Fourth, there is no definitive way to define local healthcare markets and our use of counties for most market variables is driven by available data. Finally, the sample is only approximately representative of the elderly, non-ESRD Medicare beneficiaries because it excludes Medicare Advantage enrollees, new enrollees, and beneficiaries because use no physician services over an extended time period, and it uses an indirect sampling method.\nA final limitation is that our study focused only on costs, without considering effects on outcomes (for which claims data are not particularly suited). Though not reported here, we constructed mortality and ambulatory sensitive hospitalization rates (which are analyzed in another study). We did attempt to identify factors that were efficiency enhancing or diminishing by estimating parallel reduced-form models, but the results were ambiguous."

              "To measure this concept, one must measure costs, select appropriate outcome measures, determine whether and how to combine them, and compare state scores. Based on the methods used in the studies reviewed, a three-phased approach is recommended. First, MPR proposes to construct measures of costs per enrollee, stratified by enrollee categories. We also propose to standardize or adjust costs for factors that influence variation in state Medicaid spending that are clearly beyond state Medicaid agency control. Second, MPR would examine quality and access to care measures for which data is available across all or most states to assess whether variation in outcomes and variation in costs appear to be linked. Because the literature provides less guidance for Medicaid quality and other outcome measurement than for expenditure analyses, we will continue to seek input on appropriate outcome measures to be used. Third, MPR will assess alternate ways to rank and compare state performance on cost and outcome measures.\n##  Measuring Medicaid Spending and Costs\nCalculating per enrollee cost measures that support accurate cross-state comparisons requires several technical decisions, including: (1) how to stratify Medicaid enrollees to create reasonably similar comparison groups, (2) whether to examine costs for specific services and if so, how to identify service costs for enrollees in managed care plans, (3) whether to include or exclude costs that cannot be attributed to individual enrollees, such as administrative costs and disproportionate share hospital payments, and (4) how to adjust for factors that are beyond the control of state Medicaid agencies.",
              "Since the proportion of total enrollees in these groups varies by state, we could: (1) examine per enrollee expenditures separately for each of the subgroups, or (2) present only group-level (for example, aged) per enrollee expenditures, but standardize the measures so the proportion of enrollees within each subgroup (for example, aged/dual eligible, aged/not dual eligible) is held constant in assessing overall group level per enrollee expenditures. Because limited-benefit enrollees (for example, adults qualifying only for family planning services) account for a small proportion of Medicaid spending and receive very few services, we do not recommend including them in analyses of per enrollee expenditures.\nService Costs and Medicaid Managed Care. Measures of efficiency often focus on cost per unit of service. In the Medicaid context, this would mean comparing spending per enrollee for discrete service categories, such as hospital inpatient care, prescription drugs, nursing home care, and physician visits. But lower cost per service does not necessarily produce higher value in terms of better quality or other outcomes. In addition, from the purchaser\u2019s perspective, efficiency could result from a different of services provided to enrollees, which argues against analyzing costs at the unit of service level.",
              "For these reasons, we recommend (1) measuring state Medicaid spending for population subgroups for two broad categories of services---acute care and long-term-care---rather than for specific services, and (2) combining fee-for-service (FFS) and managed care populations in each of these two service categories, to the extent that enrollees in managed care organizations (MCOs) can be divided into those receiving primarily acute care versus long-term care services. This higher level of aggregation should produce useful comparisons across states about the efficiency or value obtained through the mix of services provided, and through greater or lesser use of capitated or other forms of managed care compared to fee-for-service payment and delivery models. It is also a practical decision; limitations in the availability of service-specific expenditure data for Medicaid managed care enrollees, whose care is paid on a capitation basis, would restrict detailed comparisons of per-service costs to a small subset of states with little managed care enrollment, or to the long-term care sector where managed care is not as prevalent.\n. Numerous studies and reports highlight large variation in the amount and proportion of total state Medicaid spending on DSH expenditures. However, since DSH payments, and other payments cannot be attributed to individual Medicaid enrollees, and DSH payments cover the cost of care for non-Medicaid, indigent individuals, we do not recommend including these costs in our analysis."

              "Estimates of the marginal cost per unit of health produced by the healthcare system present an important policy tool to guide funding decisions for new health technologies and interventions by facilitating the interpretation of cost-effectiveness analyses that represent a key input to many national reimbursement decisions. Building on earlier work by Martin et al. [, ], the seminal work by Claxton et al. [] presented the first empirical estimate of the marginal cost per unit of health of the NHS in England, followed by similar estimates for Spain [], Australia [], Sweden [], The Netherlands [, ], South Africa [] and China []. The broad rationale for estimating the marginal cost per unit of health produced by the healthcare system in these reviewed studies was to guide health funding decisions. Where the true opportunity cost is unknown, that is, when decisions to fund a new health technology or intervention do not specify what is to be forgone, then an empirical estimate can provide the next best option to quantify the net health impact."

Use the following stepwise procedure and section structure to assemble the output.\n\n1) Overall structure and framing\n- Begin with a short framing sentence explaining that the analysis brings together: (a) empirical per\u2011beneficiary and marginal cost estimates, documented offsets/savings, and implementation/admin timelines from node_2; and (b) candidate revenue yields, quintile incidence, and implementation/political\u2011feasibility evidence from node_3. Cite both nodes: \u201c(see node_2; node_3).\u201d\n- State that the list will cover three main areas: Fiscal considerations, Implementation considerations, and Political considerations \u2014 and that each bullet will indicate which child node(s) provided the data or evidence.\n\n2) Fiscal considerations (use node_2 + node_3)\n- Aggregate program cost estimates by service category:\n  - For each service category reported in node_2, present: (i) per\u2011beneficiary annual cost, (ii) a high\u2011level marginal\u2011cost curve summary (e.g., steepness or increasing marginal cost at scale), and (iii) documented offsets/savings tied to that service. Cite node_2 for all numbers.\n  - Provide a worked approach for computing gross annual cost under three scaling scenarios (examples to produce in the parent output): targeted (partial coverage), broad expansion (majority coverage), and near\u2011universal. Specify the formula: gross_cost_category = per_beneficiary_cost * target_population + implementation/admin_costs (use case study admin costs from node_2). Tell the synthesizer to pull numeric per\u2011beneficiary values and admin cost estimates from node_2 for each service.\n- Net cost after offsets:\n  - Explain how to subtract documented offsets/savings from node_2 (specifying which offsets apply immediately vs with lag) to produce net program cost. Indicate any offsets that are conditional (e.g., require behavior change) and flag timing assumptions (short\u2011term vs long\u2011term). Cite node_2.\n- Revenue match and distributional trade\u2011offs:\n  - For each financing option in node_3, present its annual yield and quintile incidence. Instruct to compute how much of the net cost (from the previous step) each revenue source would cover alone, and then for plausible combinations of revenue sources. Require explicit calculations or percentages: e.g., percent_covered = revenue_yield / net_program_cost. Use node_3 yields and incidence.\n  - Produce a short list of candidate financing bundles (2\u20133 illustrative mixes) that fully or partially fund the net cost. For each bundle, show: total yield, share of program cost covered, and distributional incidence across income quintiles (use quintile shares from node_3 aggregated across the bundle). Cite node_3 for all incidence numbers.\n- Trade\u2011offs and sensitivity:\n  - Use marginal\u2011cost curves from node_2 to explain how scaling up increases marginal spending per beneficiary and how that affects required revenues. Instruct to present sensitivity bands: low/mid/high cost scenarios using the marginal cost information from node_2 and yield uncertainty from node_3.\n  - Flag potential offsets identified in node_2 that could materially reduce required revenues and indicate the magnitude and timing of those savings.\n\n3) Implementation considerations (use node_2 primarily; draw on node_3 where relevant)\n- Administrative and implementation cost and timing:\n  - For each service category, report the implementation/admin cost ranges and timeline reported in node_2 case studies. Provide concrete statements like: expected start\u2011to\u2011steady state time = X years; one\u2011time admin build\u2011out cost = $Y billion. Cite node_2.\n- Capacity, marginal cost, and phasing strategy:\n  - Use marginal\u2011cost curves (node_2) to recommend phasing rules: prioritize expansions where marginal cost is lowest or returns/offsets highest. For example, phase 1 = services with low marginal cost and high offsets; phase 2 = higher marginal cost categories. Cite node_2.\n- Operational constraints and mitigation:\n  - Summarize documented operational constraints (workforce, IT, enrollment systems, verification) from node_2 case studies and give mitigation/tempo recommendations (e.g., pilot in X states, invest Y in admin systems first). Cite node_2.\n- Interaction with financing implementation:\n  - Note any implementation trade\u2011offs for revenue options from node_3 (e.g., administrative complexity, need for new tax collection mechanisms) and how those affect rollout timing and administrative cost. Cite node_3.\n\n4) Political considerations (use node_3 primarily; reference node_2 where relevant)\n- Distributional politics:\n  - Use quintile incidence from node_3 to show who bears the tax burden for each candidate revenue option and how that aligns or conflicts with the intended beneficiaries (use beneficiary distribution from node_2 where available). Cite node_3 for incidence and node_2 for beneficiary profiles.\n- Feasibility and political trade\u2011offs:\n  - Summarize the political\u2011feasibility evidence for each revenue option from node_3 (likeliest politically viable options, documented opposition, administrative acceptability). For each financing bundle recommended above, state its political strengths/weaknesses using node_3 evidence.\n- Messaging and sequencing recommendations:\n  - Recommend sequencing or packaging strategies (e.g., pair services with revenue sources that are progressive or popular) based on node_3\u2019s political evidence and node_2\u2019s evidence on short\u2011term offsets that can be highlighted as savings. Cite node_3 and node_2.\n- Risks and contingency:\n  - List political risks (e.g., voter backlash in particular quintiles; interest\u2011group opposition) drawn from node_3 and suggest contingency measures (phased implementation, targeted subsidies) referencing the implementation levers from node_2.\n\n5) Produce explicit synthesis bullets tying fiscal, implementation, and political elements together\n- For each service category (use node_2), produce a short \u201cpolicy tile\u201d bullet that contains:\n  - one\u2011line summary of per\u2011beneficiary cost and marginal cost shape (node_2),\n  - estimated net annual cost under a specified scale scenario (use the calculation method above and node_2 offsets),\n  - suggested financing option or bundle and its coverage/share of cost and quintile incidence (node_3),\n  - recommended implementation timeline and key operational steps (node_2),\n  - political feasibility score and recommended messaging/packaging (node_3).\n- End with a short wrap\u2011up bullet that states total net fiscal requirement across all services under the chosen scenario and the recommended financing bundle, plus top three implementation priorities and top three political mitigation strategies \u2014 each linked to the supporting child node(s).\n\n6) Presentation and traceability rules\n- In every numeric or evidence claim, append the child source parenthetically: e.g., \u201cper\u2011beneficiary = $X (node_2)\u201d, \u201cannual yield = $Y (node_3)\u201d.\n- Where you combine numbers from node_2 and node_3 (e.g., net cost minus revenue), show the arithmetic explicitly and cite both nodes after the result.\n- Flag assumptions and uncertainties explicitly and attribute their source (node_2 for cost/offset uncertainty; node_3 for revenue/yield and incidence uncertainty).\n- If any child lacks specific data needed for a calculation, state the missing item and indicate that the parent output will present qualitative implications and sensitivity ranges rather than a precise point estimate. Reference which child lacked the data (node_2 or node_3).\n\nUse this procedure to generate the parent list output; ensure each bullet/line in the parent output is clearly tied back to node_2 and/or node_3 by ID so downstream users can follow the provenance.",

          "answer": "- Framing and scope (see node_2; node_3): This synthesis combines (a) empirical per\u2011beneficiary and service\u2011level cost patterns, limited marginal\u2011cost evidence, and identified implementation/administrative evidence gaps (node_2); and (b) the availability (or absence) of annual revenue yields, quintile incidence, and political\u2011feasibility evidence for candidate financing options (node_3). The list below addresses three areas \u2014 Fiscal, Implementation, and Political \u2014 and each bullet indicates which child node(s) supplied the underlying data or identified evidence gaps (node_2; node_3).\n\nFiscal considerations (node_2 + node_3)\n\n- Aggregate program cost inputs and per\u2011beneficiary figures to use (node_2): use per\u2011beneficiary annual cost = $48,000 (average predicted high\u2011cost beneficiaries) and \u2248 $7,000 (average predicted low\u2011cost beneficiaries) \u2014 medians $37,704 and $3,406 respectively \u2014 and note concentration of spending: ~69% of total costs concentrated in the 25% classified as predicted high\u2011cost, with high\u2011cost beneficiaries accounting for ~79% of hospital and ~84% of post\u2011acute care spending (node_2). Use these per\u2011beneficiary numbers when building gross cost estimates by service or subgroup (node_2).\n\n- Service\u2011level marginal\u2011cost summary and limitations (node_2): the supplied materials do not provide empirical numerical marginal\u2011cost curves by specific service category; instead they provide system\u2011level marginal\u2011cost estimates across countries and note that marginal\u2011cost estimates are highly sensitive to modelling choices and data constraints. Therefore treat marginal\u2011cost shape as qualitatively uncertain: scaling likely raises marginal cost in some categories, but numeric marginal\u2011cost slopes are not available in the sources (node_2).\n\n- Worked approach (formula) for gross annual cost under three scaling scenarios (use these algebraic formulas and plug in node_2 per\u2011beneficiary numbers where possible):\n  - Formula: gross_cost_category = per_beneficiary_cost * target_population + implementation/admin_costs (node_2).\n  - Example algebraic instances using node_2 per\u2011beneficiary numbers:\n    - Targeted (partial coverage): gross_cost_targeted = $48,000 * (share_targeted * total_enrollees) + admin_costs (node_2).\n    - Broad expansion (majority coverage): gross_cost_broad = per_beneficiary_assumed * (~0.5 * total_enrollees) + admin_costs (node_2).\n    - Near\u2011universal: gross_cost_universal = per_beneficiary_assumed * (\u2248total_enrollees) + admin_costs (node_2).\n  - Important data gap: the case studies do not report empirical implementation/admin cost amounts or timelines to fill in the admin_costs term \u2014 therefore numeric gross costs cannot be completed from the supplied materials (node_2).\n\n- Net cost after offsets: method and data gaps (node_2):\n  - Method: net_program_cost = gross_cost_category \u2212 documented_offsets_savings (apply offsets immediately or with lag as appropriate).\n  - Data reality from sources: the supplied node_2 materials do not enumerate concrete, quantifiable offsets/savings by service with timing sufficient to produce a precise net cost; they do report provider responsiveness elasticities (fee\u2011differential elasticities 0.41 for low\u2011cost and 0.23 for high\u2011cost beneficiaries) suggesting some potential for behavioral savings but not explicit dollar offsets (node_2). Thus offsets must be treated as uncertain and, where used, explicitly annotated as conditional on behavior change and timing assumptions (short\u2011term vs long\u2011term) (node_2).\n\n- Revenue match and distributional trade\u2011offs \u2014 data limitations (node_3):\n  - Missing required inputs: node_3 provides no annual revenue yields and no quintile\u2011level incidence for candidate financing options, and supplies no implementation trade\u2011off or political\u2011feasibility evidence for those revenue options (node_3). Therefore percent_covered = revenue_yield / net_program_cost cannot be numerically computed from the supplied sources.\n  - Practical implication: one can construct the percent_covered algebraically (percent_covered = revenue_yield / net_program_cost), but the revenue_yield and incidence vectors are absent in the materials \u2014 any numeric matching requires additional fiscal estimates not present in the supplied documents (node_3).\n\n- Candidate financing bundles \u2014 qualitative guidance only (node_3; node_2):\n  - Because node_3 lacks yield and incidence numbers, we cannot produce numeric bundles. We therefore provide an illustrative bundling logic (no numeric yields):\n    - Bundle A (progressive\u2011oriented): combine revenue sources that are typically concentrated on higher incomes (not quantified here) to match net_cost; incidence unknown (node_3). Use per\u2011beneficiary targeting to reduce gross costs first (node_2).\n    - Bundle B (broad\u2011based): combine broad\u2011based sources plus targeted offsets to spread burden; incidence unknown (node_3).\n    - Bundle C (phased financing): short\u2011term revenue (interim funding) paired with later permanent revenue once offsets materialize; specifics unavailable (node_3; node_2).\n  - Each bundle requires numerical yields and quintile incidence to evaluate fully; those numbers are not in node_3 and so cannot be shown here (node_3).\n\n- Trade\u2011offs and sensitivity (node_2; node_3):\n  - Use marginal\u2011cost qualitative message from node_2: as scale increases, expect higher marginal spending per additional beneficiary in some categories; because numerical marginal\u2011cost curves are unavailable, present three qualitative scenarios \u2014 low/mid/high marginal\u2011cost scale\u2011up \u2014 and flag revenue uncertainty (node_2; node_3).\n  - Offsets that could materially reduce required revenues are not numerically specified in node_2; their magnitude and timing are therefore uncertain and must be modeled as scenarios (node_2).\n\nImplementation considerations (primarily node_2; note node_3 gaps)\n\n- Administrative and implementation cost and timing \u2014 evidence gap (node_2):\n  - Node_2 case studies explicitly do not report empirical implementation or administrative cost estimates or timelines \u2014 this is an identified evidence gap. Therefore concrete numbers like \"one\u2011time admin build\u2011out cost = $Y billion\" or \"start\u2011to\u2011steady state time = X years\" cannot be provided from the sources (node_2).\n\n- Recommended costing and measurement approach from federal guidance (node_2):\n  - Where service\u2011level data are limited, federal Medicaid guidance suggests constructing stratified per\u2011enrollee cost measures, standardizing and adjusting them, and aggregating into broad categories (acute vs long\u2011term) \u2014 use these methods to generate administratively feasible estimates in lieu of absent case study numbers (node_2).\n\n- Capacity, marginal cost, and phasing (node_2):\n  - Phasing rule (qualitative and evidence\u2011based): prioritize expansions where marginal cost is likely lowest or where expected offsets/returns are highest (e.g., prioritize services concentrated in high\u2011offset areas per spending composition evidence). Node_2 shows that inpatient/post\u2011acute spending is highly concentrated among predicted high\u2011cost beneficiaries (node_2); therefore a phase that targets high\u2011return interventions for that subgroup could be prioritized.\n  - Cite marginal responsiveness: greater responsiveness among healthier enrollees (elasticity 0.41 low\u2011cost vs 0.23 high\u2011cost) suggests different behavioral effects by subgroup and should shape phase sequencing (node_2).\n\n- Operational constraints and mitigation (node_2):\n  - The supplied case studies do not provide detailed operational constraints (e.g., workforce numbers, IT costs) in numeric form; the documented guidance emphasizes the need for stratified measurement and aggregation when detailed service\u2011level data are missing \u2014 use pilots and data investments before full rollout (node_2).\n\n- Interaction with financing implementation (node_3; node_2):\n  - Node_3 contains no evidence on implementation trade\u2011offs for revenue options (e.g., collection complexity), so specific interactions between financing mechanisms and rollout timing cannot be assessed from the supplied materials (node_3).\n  - Use the measurement approach from node_2 to limit administrative complexity (e.g., aggregate categories rather than trying to bill at ultra\u2011granular service levels) when designing financing\u2011linked implementation plans (node_2).\n\nPolitical considerations (primarily node_3; reference node_2)\n\n- Distributional politics \u2014 what can and cannot be said (node_3; node_2):\n  - Node_3 supplies no quintile incidence for candidate revenue options, so who would bear the tax burden for each financing option cannot be determined from the sources (node_3).\n  - Partial alignment insight from node_2: program benefits/costs are heavily concentrated in a small high\u2011cost subgroup (\u224825% of beneficiaries account for \u224869% of costs), and high\u2011cost beneficiaries disproportionately account for hospital and post\u2011acute spending (node_2). Without node_3 incidence data, we cannot say whether financing would fall on the same groups as beneficiaries or on different income quintiles (node_3; node_2).\n\n- Feasibility and political trade\u2011offs \u2014 data gap (node_3):\n  - Node_3 provides no political\u2011feasibility evidence for candidate revenue options; therefore statements about likely political viability, documented opposition, or acceptability are unavailable in the sources (node_3).\n\n- Messaging and sequencing recommendations \u2014 constrained by evidence (node_3; node_2):\n  - Given node_3's absence of political evidence, recommended messaging must rely on implementation/cost features from node_2 (e.g., highlight concentration of benefits among high\u2011need groups and any short\u2011term offsets if/when they can be demonstrated). However, node_2 does not provide quantified offsets that could be touted as immediate savings \u2014 so messaging would have to be cautious and emphasize pilot results and phased returns (node_2; node_3).\n\n- Risks and contingencies (node_3; node_2):\n  - Political risks (who bears the burden, interest\u2011group opposition, voter backlash) cannot be evaluated empirically using node_3 because incidence and political\u2011feasibility evidence are absent (node_3).\n  - Implementation levers to mitigate political risk that are present in node_2 are structural: phased rollout, targeting to reduce upfront gross_cost, and improved measurement to demonstrate offsets over time (node_2).\n\nPolicy tiles tying fiscal, implementation, and political elements together (for service categories covered in node_2)\n\n- Tile: Inpatient/hospital care\n  - Per\u2011beneficiary cost and marginal\u2011cost shape: for predicted high\u2011cost beneficiaries, average annual standardized cost \u2248 $48,000 (median $37,704); hospital spending is highly concentrated among high\u2011cost beneficiaries (high\u2011cost group accounts for ~79% of hospital spending) \u2014 marginal\u2011cost shape not numerically specified but scaling likely increases marginal spending (node_2).\n  - Estimated net annual cost under a specified scale scenario (targeted to high\u2011cost 25%): gross_cost_inpatient_targeted = $48,000 * (0.25 * total_enrollees) + admin_costs; documented offsets/savings not provided so net cost cannot be numerically computed from supplied materials (node_2).\n  - Suggested financing bundle and coverage/share: cannot supply numeric yield or percent_covered because node_3 provides no revenue yields or incidence; bundling choices therefore remain qualitative (node_3).\n  - Implementation timeline and steps: recommend using stratified per\u2011enrollee cost construction and aggregate reporting (acute vs long\u2011term) prior to expansion; pilot targeting high\u2011cost subgroup to refine admin processes (node_2).\n  - Political feasibility score and messaging: feasibility undetermined due to lack of incidence/feasibility evidence (node_3); messaging could emphasize targeting to those with concentrated needs and planned pilots to control costs (node_2; node_3).\n\n- Tile: Post\u2011acute care\n  - Per\u2011beneficiary cost and marginal\u2011cost shape: high\u2011cost beneficiaries account for ~84% of post\u2011acute care spending; per\u2011beneficiary cost for high\u2011cost group \u2248 $48,000 average (node_2). Marginal\u2011cost curves by service are not provided; treat scaling effects as uncertain (node_2).\n  - Estimated net annual cost under a specified scale scenario (e.g., partial expansion to those with high post\u2011acute needs): gross_cost_postacute_targeted = $48,000 * (share_targeted * total_enrollees) + admin_costs; offsets not quantified in node_2 so net cost cannot be computed here (node_2).\n  - Suggested financing bundle and coverage/share: not computable (node_3); require revenue yields/incidence to evaluate trade\u2011offs.\n  - Implementation timeline and steps: aggregate data into broad categories and pilot post\u2011acute expansions to estimate admin costs and observe offsets before broad rollout (node_2).\n  - Political feasibility score and messaging: undetermined (node_3); highlight concentration of benefits and pilot evidence as confidence\u2011building measures (node_2).\n\n- Tile: Aggregate high\u2011cost subgroup (top 25% predicted)\n  - Per\u2011beneficiary cost and marginal\u2011cost shape: top 25% have average \u2248 $48,000 and account for ~69% of total costs; marginal cost information lacking numerical curves, but concentration suggests targeted interventions could yield outsized impact per dollar (node_2).\n  - Estimated net annual cost under targeted scenario (cover top 25%): gross_cost = $48,000 * (0.25 * total_enrollees) + admin_costs; net cost undetermined due to absent quantified offsets and absent admin cost estimates (node_2).\n  - Suggested financing bundle and coverage/share: cannot be numerically specified because node_3 provides no revenue yields/incidence; qualitatively, targeting the high\u2011cost subgroup reduces gross budget needs relative to universal expansion but still requires revenue numbers to match (node_2; node_3).\n  - Implementation timeline and steps: phase 1 = targeted pilots for top 25% with stratified measurement; use pilots to estimate admin build\u2011out and to observe offsets (node_2).\n  - Political feasibility score and messaging: feasibility unknown from node_3; messaging can emphasize efficiency and concentration of benefits (node_2).\n\nWrap\u2011up synthesis and priorities\n\n- Total net fiscal requirement across services under a chosen scenario and recommended financing bundle: cannot be computed from supplied materials because node_3 provides no annual revenue yields or incidence and node_2 lacks admin cost and quantified offsets; algebraic expression: total_net_cost = sum_over_categories[per_beneficiary_cost_category * target_pop_category + admin_costs_category \u2212 offsets_category] with per_beneficiary numbers available for high/low groups but admin_costs_category, offsets_category, and precise target_pop_category (absolute counts) missing from the supplied materials (node_2; node_3).\n\n- Top three implementation priorities (based on node_2):\n  1. Build stratified per\u2011enrollee cost measurement and standardized aggregation (acute vs long\u2011term) before full rollout (node_2).\n  2. Pilot targeted expansions (e.g., top 25% predicted high\u2011cost) to estimate admin costs, observe offsets, and refine marginal\u2011cost behavior (node_2).\n  3. Use phased sequencing based on expected low marginal cost / high offsets first (node_2).\n\n- Top three political mitigation strategies (noted limitations: node_3 lacks political evidence so these are structural mitigations suggested by node_2\u2019s operational guidance):\n  1. Use pilots and transparent interim evaluations to demonstrate offsets/returns before scaling (node_2; node_3 absence noted).\n  2. Phase and target expansions to limit upfront fiscal shock and to tailor messaging about efficiency (node_2).\n  3. Delay permanent financing decisions until revenue yields and incidence are estimated (data absent in node_3) so policy makers can choose bundles that match distributional goals (node_3; node_2).\n\nAssumptions, uncertainties, and missing data (traceability and required follow\u2011up)\n\n- Key data missing in node_2: numeric marginal\u2011cost curves by service category, documented quantitative offsets/savings with timing, and empirical implementation/admin cost estimates and timelines (node_2).\n- Key data missing in node_3: annual revenue yields for candidate financing options, quintile\u2011level distributional incidence, and any implementation trade\u2011off or political\u2011feasibility evidence for financing options (node_3).\n- Consequence: many fiscal match calculations (percent_covered, bundle yields, distributional impacts) cannot be completed with the supplied documents; the output therefore provides formulas, qualitative sequencing, and explicit algebraic placeholders and flags where node_2 or node_3 data are required to produce numeric answers (node_2; node_3).\n\n(End of synthesis \u2014 all empirical numbers and evidence claims above are drawn directly from node_2 and node_3 as cited; where either child lacked required data the output explicitly states that limitation and refrains from inventing numeric estimates.)

              "Most earlier studies addressing factors contributing to Medicare costs (mostly defined as government payments) rely on relationships among geographic area means (e.g., ; [Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sciences 1999](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3165175/#b5); ;). Area-based analyses are particularly prone to bias from unmeasured demand or supply factors likely to confound relationships among area averages (Zuckerman et al. 2010). Moreover, beneficiaries within geographic areas are likely to have heterogeneous characteristics, within-area distributions of variables are likely to vary considerably across areas, and often will not be normally distributed (e.g., health status). As a result, associations among area means and ratios will likely deviate from those that would be estimated at the individual patient level (). Consequently, we estimate determinants of Medicare expenditures (costs) at the beneficiary level.\nAlthough no study can avoid specification bias by including all relevant variables, our study investigates a substantial number of both demand and supply-side variables, many of which were not included in previous work. Finally, we compare factors contributing to the costs of treating two sets of Medicare beneficiaries, based on their expected medical costs. It is important to understand how potential effects differ, because the factors that drive the utilization of high-cost beneficiaries are of greatest policy import.",
              "The 2006 average standardized medical cost for predicted high-cost beneficiaries was nearly U.S.$48,000, compared with about U.S.$7,000 for predicted low-cost patients (). (Median values were U.S.$37,704 and U.S.$3,406, respectively.) Overall, 69 percent of total costs were spent on the 25 percent classified as predicted high-cost beneficiaries. This is lower than the 85 percent typically reported for the 25 percent most costly beneficiaries because of our inability to perfectly predict high and low-cost users, the fact that we are using standardized costs, which truncates some outlier cases, and the exclusion of beneficiaries who received no Medicare services. Medicare payments were a higher percentage of total standardized costs among high-cost beneficiaries (88 versus 82 percent), reflecting greater use of Part A services. For instance, 79 and 84 percent of expenditures on hospitals and postacute care were incurred by predicted high-cost beneficiaries, respectively, compared with about 50 percent of physician service and outpatient costs. Inpatient and postacute care accounted for 63 percent of total costs of predicted high-cost beneficiaries, as compared with 34 percent for predicted low-cost beneficiaries.\nAnnual Standardized Costs and Medicare Payments among Predicted High- and Low-Cost Medicare Beneficiaries  \nMean Costs, Given Any Use | % of Total Costsin Category | Mean Costs, Given Any Use | % of Total Costs in Category | % of Costs Incurred by Predicted High-Cost Beneficiaries  \n\u201cOther\u201d includes clinical lab services, durable medical equipment, Part B drugs, hospice care, psychiatric facility care, and long-term care hospital care.\npresents multivariable results for predicted high-and low-cost beneficiaries. Along with model coefficients, we assess variables' relative importance by reporting elasticities for continuous variables and the coefficient as a percent of mean standardized costs for categorical variables.",
              "The Medicare fee difference variable generated the largest elasticities. Consistent with our hypothesis and previous research, higher relative fees are associated with greater service provision (; ;). The estimated elasticity is larger (0.41) among low-cost beneficiaries than among high-cost beneficiaries (0.23), suggesting physicians may exercise greater discretion in the treatment of healthier beneficiaries.\nAlthough models estimated over the entire sample of low- and high-cost patients explain two-thirds of the variation in beneficiaries' medical costs, several limitations should be noted. First, causal inferences should be made cautiously because the data are cross-sectional. Second, unobserved heterogeneity in the beneficiary population could be correlated with model variables and bias coefficients. Third, available data limit our ability to characterize all key features of local health care markets (e.g., level of care coordination). Fourth, there is no definitive way to define local healthcare markets and our use of counties for most market variables is driven by available data. Finally, the sample is only approximately representative of the elderly, non-ESRD Medicare beneficiaries because it excludes Medicare Advantage enrollees, new enrollees, and beneficiaries because use no physician services over an extended time period, and it uses an indirect sampling method.\nA final limitation is that our study focused only on costs, without considering effects on outcomes (for which claims data are not particularly suited). Though not reported here, we constructed mortality and ambulatory sensitive hospitalization rates (which are analyzed in another study). We did attempt to identify factors that were efficiency enhancing or diminishing by estimating parallel reduced-form models, but the results were ambiguous."

              "To measure this concept, one must measure costs, select appropriate outcome measures, determine whether and how to combine them, and compare state scores. Based on the methods used in the studies reviewed, a three-phased approach is recommended. First, MPR proposes to construct measures of costs per enrollee, stratified by enrollee categories. We also propose to standardize or adjust costs for factors that influence variation in state Medicaid spending that are clearly beyond state Medicaid agency control. Second, MPR would examine quality and access to care measures for which data is available across all or most states to assess whether variation in outcomes and variation in costs appear to be linked. Because the literature provides less guidance for Medicaid quality and other outcome measurement than for expenditure analyses, we will continue to seek input on appropriate outcome measures to be used. Third, MPR will assess alternate ways to rank and compare state performance on cost and outcome measures.\n##  Measuring Medicaid Spending and Costs\nCalculating per enrollee cost measures that support accurate cross-state comparisons requires several technical decisions, including: (1) how to stratify Medicaid enrollees to create reasonably similar comparison groups, (2) whether to examine costs for specific services and if so, how to identify service costs for enrollees in managed care plans, (3) whether to include or exclude costs that cannot be attributed to individual enrollees, such as administrative costs and disproportionate share hospital payments, and (4) how to adjust for factors that are beyond the control of state Medicaid agencies.",
              "Since the proportion of total enrollees in these groups varies by state, we could: (1) examine per enrollee expenditures separately for each of the subgroups, or (2) present only group-level (for example, aged) per enrollee expenditures, but standardize the measures so the proportion of enrollees within each subgroup (for example, aged/dual eligible, aged/not dual eligible) is held constant in assessing overall group level per enrollee expenditures. Because limited-benefit enrollees (for example, adults qualifying only for family planning services) account for a small proportion of Medicaid spending and receive very few services, we do not recommend including them in analyses of per enrollee expenditures.\nService Costs and Medicaid Managed Care. Measures of efficiency often focus on cost per unit of service. In the Medicaid context, this would mean comparing spending per enrollee for discrete service categories, such as hospital inpatient care, prescription drugs, nursing home care, and physician visits. But lower cost per service does not necessarily produce higher value in terms of better quality or other outcomes. In addition, from the purchaser\u2019s perspective, efficiency could result from a different of services provided to enrollees, which argues against analyzing costs at the unit of service level.",
              "For these reasons, we recommend (1) measuring state Medicaid spending for population subgroups for two broad categories of services---acute care and long-term-care---rather than for specific services, and (2) combining fee-for-service (FFS) and managed care populations in each of these two service categories, to the extent that enrollees in managed care organizations (MCOs) can be divided into those receiving primarily acute care versus long-term care services. This higher level of aggregation should produce useful comparisons across states about the efficiency or value obtained through the mix of services provided, and through greater or lesser use of capitated or other forms of managed care compared to fee-for-service payment and delivery models. It is also a practical decision; limitations in the availability of service-specific expenditure data for Medicaid managed care enrollees, whose care is paid on a capitation basis, would restrict detailed comparisons of per-service costs to a small subset of states with little managed care enrollment, or to the long-term care sector where managed care is not as prevalent.\n. Numerous studies and reports highlight large variation in the amount and proportion of total state Medicaid spending on DSH expenditures. However, since DSH payments, and other payments cannot be attributed to individual Medicaid enrollees, and DSH payments cover the cost of care for non-Medicaid, indigent individuals, we do not recommend including these costs in our analysis."

These include modelling approaches to estimating mortality- and morbidity-related effects from health spending, measurement of key variables, accounting for endogeneity in the health spending on health outcomes equation, the inclusion of lagged spending, discounting and future costs, the use of analytical weights, level of disease aggregation and the expected duration of health gains.  \nFuture estimates of the marginal cost per unit of health produced by a healthcare system should include (1) careful consideration of the specific context and data available, (2) clear and transparent reporting on the assumptions made and stakeholder perspectives on their appropriateness and acceptability, and (3) assessment of the sensitivity of the preferred central estimate to these assumptions.",
              "Estimates of the marginal cost per unit of health produced by the healthcare system present an important policy tool to guide funding decisions for new health technologies and interventions by facilitating the interpretation of cost-effectiveness analyses that represent a key input to many national reimbursement decisions. Building on earlier work by Martin et al. [, ], the seminal work by Claxton et al. [] presented the first empirical estimate of the marginal cost per unit of health of the NHS in England, followed by similar estimates for Spain [], Australia [], Sweden [], The Netherlands [, ], South Africa [] and China []. The broad rationale for estimating the marginal cost per unit of health produced by the healthcare system in these reviewed studies was to guide health funding decisions. Where the true opportunity cost is unknown, that is, when decisions to fund a new health technology or intervention do not specify what is to be forgone, then an empirical estimate can provide the next best option to quantify the net health impact."

              "To what extent does the research on the long-run effects of the social safety net line up with these predictions? First, there is consistent evidence that social safety net investments during childhood lead to improved adult human capital and economic outcomes as well as health. Aizer (2016) examine an early 20th century cash welfare program and find that additional income in childhood leads to greater educational attainment, income, body weight, and life expectancy. Increased family resources during childhood through the Earned Income Tax Credit have been shown to increase children\u2019s cognitive outcomes (; , ) as well as educational attainment and employment in young adulthood (). While perhaps less mechanistically connected to the increase in resources from these near-cash programs, related work shows that public investments through Head Start preschools and Medicaid also lead to improvements in adult human capital and health. The evidence on the relative importance of exposure is more mixed. show the beneficial effects of Food Stamps on adult metabolic health derive from exposure prior to age five. Aizer (2016) provide suggestive evidence that the positive effects of cash welfare may be larger for children exposed at younger ages. , however, find that larger EITC payments during the teen years, rather than early childhood, drive the increases in educational attainment and earnings in young adulthood.\nAnother mechanism for long-run effects of Food Stamps is a reduction in stress. Recent work shows that lower socio-economic status may be causally related to stress hormones ( cortisol) and that additional resources may attenuate this relationship (; ; ). In turn, and document that in utero exposure to maternal stress has adverse impacts on children\u2019s short- and long-term outcomes."

              "Now that this brief has addressed core characteristics of cash transfer programs, what does the literature say about their effectiveness? This is a challenging question, because cash transfer programs are necessarily context-dependent ([Zhao et al., 2023 [Ch. 2]](https://utorontopress.com/9781487545178/cash-transfers-for-inclusive-societies/); ). Each program unfolds in a specific social context with unique eligibility criteria and disbursements, all of which influence generalizability. Moreover, the specific objectives of a program (e.g., reducing the number of nights spent homeless vs. improving child nutrition) inform its methods (e.g., cash plus housing vouchers vs. cash plus child healthcare access). \nNonetheless, researchers have reported on the general impacts of cash transfers by looking across many programs and summarizing findings using meta-analysis or systematic review. These studies have largely supported the efficacy of conditional and unconditional cash transfers in lifting individuals out of poverty and improving a range of positive outcomes.",
              "Conditional cash transfer programs have mostly been implemented in low- and middle-income countries, targeting families with young children. The short term effectiveness of these programs has been well established, with reviews showing that conditional cash transfers raise savings and investments by around 10-20% of the size of the transfer without reducing labor force participation (), positively influence household consumption by better balancing spending and saving (), and increase the use of preventative health services while improving objective and subjective health (). Regarding young children, conditional cash transfers lower rates of child labor, particularly for boys (), improve school enrollment and attendance (), increase the uptake of maternal and newborn health services (), and generally benefit child health by improving access to care, increasing child and maternal nutrition and immunizations, and reducing morbidity risk and household poverty (). Conditional cash transfers may be more effective in middle-income (vs. low-income) countries, as these countries more often have functional health systems that recipients can use their cash to access (; ).\nSome reviews have tried to estimate the longer-term effects of conditional cash transfers, asking whether these programs break intergenerational cycles of poverty. Evidence for this is considerably more mixed: conditional cash transfers appear to provide some important long-term impacts on schooling, but evidence for other outcomes is limited due to methodological challenges or weak/non-existent long-term impacts ().",
              "In sum, both conditional and unconditional cash transfers appear effective at improving a range of financial, health, and education outcomes. Conditional programs have a longer research history and are mostly conducted in low- and middle-income countries, whereas unconditional programs are relatively newer approaches favored by Western nations like the U.S. and Canada. Although most evidence is on individuals in poverty (rather than individuals experiencing homelessness), recent reviews suggest that programs are most beneficial for the poorest and most vulnerable recipients (Neighly et al., 2022). This suggests that these programs may be highly effective in helping people experiencing homelessness, and two pioneering programs in the U.S. and Canada are now directly testing these questions.\n## What are some examples of direct cash transfer programs targeting people experiencing homelessness?\nAs referenced earlier, , , and the maintain databases of active and past cash transfer programs. Honing in on Community Solutions\u2019 interests, this research brief describes two pilot cash transfer programs aimed at individuals experiencing homelessness, one in and one in the , as well as a related program using \u201cCentralized Diversion Funds\u201d in the .\n### New Leaf Project, Vancouver, B.C."

              "Further research is needed to better understand the characteristics of cash transfer programs that facilitate access to child care and support employment. While traditional economic theory predicts (and have suggested) that unconditional cash transfers will lead to a decline in labor force participation, more recent studies of the employment effects of the \u2014as well as a similar [child benefit program in Canada](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28556/w28556.pdf) that used real-world data and a \u2014found no evidence of a negative labor market response. Meanwhile, the decision to enter the labor force or increase the number of hours worked is complex for parents of young children. A [recent review of the research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9331-3) on child care use and labor force participation among parents of young children suggests that increased access to child care\u2014through reduced out-of-pocket costs or increased availability of public early care and education programs\u2014has positive impacts on maternal labor force participation and work hours; however, the findings also point to considerable variation across different family situations.\nAs this brief has illustrated, the evidence base indicates that cash transfers support infant and toddler development and address an ongoing need for American families with low incomes. Families with low incomes often need additional income support to meet their family\u2019s basic needs; cash transfers do this effectively by allowing families the how to spend their payments to reduce the stressors associated with having a low income and best support their children\u2019s development. To help federal, state, and local policymakers craft new\u2014and strengthen existing\u2014cash transfer initiatives that support infant and toddler development and well-being, we provide four policy recommendations.",
              "Policymakers should implement cash transfer programs as a supplement to existing social safety net programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, and housing subsidies. At present, most cash transfer programs like the EITC and expanded CTC are, alone, not sufficient to meet the full needs of families with infants and toddlers. Instead, they allow families the flexibility to meet needs that are unsupported by other parts of the social safety net. Policymakers should consider cash transfer programs to be one of several important tools in the poverty reduction toolbox and implement them as part of a comprehensive approach to poverty reduction. Furthermore, the impact of poverty reduction strategies such as cash transfers when used in combination with other strategies to lift families out of poverty. In order to effectively combine policy reduction strategies, policymakers should also ensure that, when implementing cash transfer programs, cash transfer benefits families\u2019 eligibility for other benefits.\nThis brief was a team effort.

              "## The Evidence on Cash Transfers\nWhile on the impact of cash transfers continues to build\u2014and there is still much to learn about what benefit amounts are effective, for whom, and in what contexts\u2014there is nonetheless a strong and compelling evidence base, laid out in this section, that cash transfers can effectively support the heathy development and well-being of young children and lay the foundation for improved outcomes throughout children\u2019s lifetimes. Indeed, a of a U.S. child allowance\u2014based on a systematic review of the evidence for the effects of cash transfers on child development and later outcomes\u2014found that a $1,000 increase in family income in one year for a single-parent family with one child generated social benefits five times greater than the initial investment (via reduced health care costs, crime, need for child protection services, etc.).\n### Cash transfers help parents with low incomes meet the essential needs of infants and toddlers.\nParents with low incomes who have infants and toddlers face barriers in meeting their children\u2019s essential needs, such as reliable nutrition and stable housing. The importance of for young children ; however, of all infants and toddlers nationally are growing up with low or very low food security, meaning that their families needed to reduce the quality and/or the quantity of food in their diets due to budgetary restrictions. , for young children is also linked to healthy child development, yet compared to infants and toddlers in families with higher incomes, those in families with low incomes were twice as likely to experience housing insecurity (4% and 2%, respectively) and three times as likely to live in crowded housing ( respectively), likely due to limited availability of ."

              "##  Cash transfer programs in the United States: Effects on child and adolescent mental health\nIn the United States, support for low\u2010income families is primarily in the form of in\u2010kind transfers such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid and housing assistance (e.g., the Housing Choice Voucher Program; Pilkauskas, Jacob, Rhodes, Richard, & Shaefer, ). In\u2010kind transfers have demonstrable benefits for families (Ellen, ; McKernan, Ratcliffe, & Braga, ; Schwartz, Horn, Ellen, & Cordes, ; Shaefer & Gutierrez, ) and there is growing interest in the United States in combining these forms of assistance with conditional and unconditional cash payments (Gennetian, Shafir, Aber, & De Hoop, ; National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, ).\nCash transfer programs typically take one of three forms in the United States: (1) tax credits for lower\u2010income working families, including the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit; (2) payments to eligible households from industry\u2010related cash distributions, such as payments to Native American households from casino profits or to Alaska state residents from the trans\u2010Alaska oil pipeline and (3) and direct cash payments to low\u2010income and other vulnerable groups through guaranteed income programs.

The first three groups used various research designs and data sources; we describe the methods and scope and highlight key challenges to determining and interpreting causal effects. The final set of studies (GI RCTs) have not measured impacts on child abuse and neglect; nevertheless, they provide insight into how cash affects parental stress, mental health, and financial security\u2014the very mechanisms through which income is expected to reduce maltreatment.\nAll these programs provide direct financial assistance, but they vary in design. TANF is a federal block grant program that gives funding to states to provide cash aid and other support to low-income families with children, with benefits that are time limited and accompanied by work requirements. More than half of TANF cases are child only\u2014that is, benefits are provided solely on the child\u2019s behalf. These cases are typically exempt from work requirements or time limits.\nSNAP offers monthly benefits to help households purchase food. The EITC is a refundable federal tax credit, and many states have supplemental EITCs that may or may not be refundable. These credits are typically accessible to working families with low-to-moderate incomes. The CTC is a tax credit provided to nearly all tax filers with dependent children. A portion of the credit is \u201crefundable,\u201d meaning families with little or no tax liability can still receive cash back from the government. By contrast, GI programs provide unconditional cash payments directly to individuals or families without restrictions on how the money is spent."

              "## How is the Medicaid program financed?\nUnlike Medicare, which is run by the federal government, Medicaid is jointly financed and jointly administered by states, territories, and the federal government. Since the Medicaid program was created in 1965, the federal government has matched state spending on Medicaid services and other costs by contributing a certain percentage of funds. This percentage \u2013 which is called the federal medical assistance percentage, or FMAP \u2013 is calculated using a formula defined by Congress that compares each state\u2019s rolling three-year average per capita income to the United States\u2019 per capita income. This results in states with lower per capita incomes receiving a higher contribution rate and states with higher per capita incomes receiving a lower contribution rate; all states have a maximum FMAP rate of 83 percent and a minimum FMAP rate of 50 percent for this base FMAP.\nMedicaid\u2019s financing structure [can be traced to its roots](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4194918/) in the public assistance system. In 1950, Congress passed a [set of amendments to the Social Security Act](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v13n10/v13n10p3.pdf) to provide states with federal matching funds for certain medical services provided to individuals who were receiving cash assistance. Then, in 1960, the Kerr-Mills Act created the Medical Assistance for the Aged program, which for health care services for certain older adults. When Congress created the Medicaid and Medicare programs through the [Social Security Amendments of 1965](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-79/pdf/STATUTE-79-Pg286.pdf), they retained the federal-state financing structure of the Kerr-Mills Act and adopted the FMAP formula that is still used today.",
              "The federal match rate for most Medicaid-covered services follows this statutorily defined formula. However, , including different FMAP rates for certain populations, providers, and activities. Congress often uses higher \u2013 or \u201cenhanced\u201d \u2013 FMAP rates to states and territories to cover certain services or populations or, alternatively, FMAP reductions to penalize states for not complying with federal requirements. For example, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 [created a time-limited FMAP increase](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/home-community-based-services/guidance-additional-resources/strengthening-and-investing-home-and-community-based-services-for-medicaid-beneficiaries-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-section-9817/index.html) for activities that \u201cenhance, expand, or strengthen\u201d home and community-based services. Congress has also used FMAP enhancements to provide broader fiscal relief to states and territories, including through a .\nImportantly, the five U.S. Territories \u2013 American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands \u2013 have a than the states. The territories\u2019 FMAP rate is set by Congress, instead of using the FMAP formula defined in statute. Historically, the Territories\u2019 FMAP rates were all set at 55%. , Congress permanently increased the FMAP rate to 83% for American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and temporarily increased Puerto Rico\u2019s FMAP to 76%. Additionally, the territories\u2019 federal funding is capped, meaning that once the territories reach their funding allotments each year, they must use entirely local funds to pay for Medicaid-covered services or take steps to manage the lack of additional federal funds, such as reducing the benefits they cover or pausing payments to providers.",
              "How do states and territories fund the \u201cstate share\u201d \u2013 or nonfederal portion \u2013 of Medicaid costs? [According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO)](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-98), in 2018, 68 percent of state share came from state general revenue (which includes state income tax, sales tax, property tax, and fees), while the remaining 32 percent came from local government, taxes on providers, and other sources. As explored below, both federal match and state share play important roles in a state\u2019s budget.\nWhy is Medicaid important to state and territory budgets?\nMedicaid plays a significant role in state and territory budgets. [According to the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO)](https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NASBO/9d2d2db1-c943-4f1b-b750-0fca152d64c2/UploadedImages/SER%20Archive/2024_SER/2024_State_Expenditure_Report_S.pdf), Medicaid was the largest total spending category for states in FY2024, representing about 30 percent of total state expenditures from all sources. However, it is important to note that federal funds \u2013 including federal Medicaid matching funds \u2013 are included in this calculation; when looking only at state general fund expenditures, Medicaid\u2019s footprint shrinks, representing 18.7 percent of general fund expenditures. This is still a substantial share of state resources, coming second only to education, meaning Medicaid plays a central role in state budget processes."

              "States are without a cap for qualified services provided to eligible enrollees. The match rate for most Medicaid enrollees is determined by a formula in the law that provides a match of at least 50% and provides a higher federal match rate for states with lower per capita income (Figure 5). States may receive a higher match rate for certain services and populations. The ACA expansion group is financed with a 90% federal match rate, so states pay 10%, and the American Rescue Plan Act included an additional to states that newly adopt the Medicaid expansion; however, the tax and spending law eliminated the incentive, effective January 1, 2026. In FY 2023, Medicaid spending totaled of which was federal spending. Medicaid typically accelerates during economic downturns as enrollment increases. Spending growth also peaked after the implementation of the ACA and, more recently, due to enrollment growth tied to the pandemic-related continuous enrollment provision.\nOverall, Medicaid accounts for a large share of most states\u2019 budgets and is often central to state fiscal decisions; however, state spending on Medicaid is second to state spending on elementary and secondary education, and the program is also the largest source of federal revenue for states. In 3, Medicaid accounted for 30% of total state expenditures, 15% of expenditures from state funds (general funds and other funds), and 57% of expenditures from federal funds received by the state.",
              "Section 1115 offer states the ability to test new approaches in Medicaid that differ from what is required by federal statute, if CMS determines that such proposals are \u201clikely to assist in promoting the objectives of the Medicaid program.\u201d Nearly all states have at least one active and some states have multiple 1115 waivers. Section 1115 waivers have been used over time and generally reflect priorities identified by the states as well as from one presidential administration to another (Figure 18). Waivers have been to expand coverage or benefits, change policies for existing Medicaid populations (e.g., testing premiums or other eligibility requirements), modify delivery systems, restructure financing or authorize new payments (e.g., supplemental payments or incentive-based payments), as well as make other program changes.",

The first Trump administration\u2019s Section 1115 waiver policy emphasized and other eligibility restrictions, payment for institutional behavioral health services, and capped financing. The Biden administration withdrew waiver approvals with work requirements, phased out approval of premium requirements, and instead states to propose waivers that expand coverage, reduce health disparities, advance \u201cwhole-person care,\u201d and improve access to behavioral health care. Areas of focus during the included leveraging Medicaid to address (including housing instability, homelessness, nutrition insecurity) and to provide health care to individuals back into the community. Several states also received approval to provide multi-year for children. Recent actions from the new Trump administration could signal efforts to curtail waivers related to of health, and to limit 1115 waiver and flexibility. In addition, several states are seeking approval for work requirements waivers. Although the tax and spending reconciliation law now includes a national work requirement, some states may continue to pursue waivers to implement work requirements prior to January 1, 2027 when the national requirement goes into effect.\nVarious types of waivers and other emergency authorities can also be used to respond to emergencies. These can help expand Medicaid capacity and focus on specific services, providers, or groups of enrollees that may be particularly impacted. During the COVID-19 pandemic, all 50 states and Washington, D.C. received approval to make changes using to facilitate access to care by expanding telehealth, eligibility, benefits and help address workforce issues for services.\nLooking to the future, Medicaid faces a number of challenges, including:"

              "Starting in the 1970s, Congress extended Medicaid coverage to new kinds of beneficiaries by granting states flexibility to provide benefits in nontraditional ways. This was accomplished by permitting CMS to waive various operational requirements on states for providing benefits. These waivers are permitted primarily under two sections of the Social Security Act. Section 1115 authorizes CMS to allow experiments through demonstration programs. These may be used for testing alternative forms of payment, such as managed care and prospective payment for hospitals, and for alternative care arrangements, such as expanded access to home and community-based services (HCBS) for beneficiaries who would otherwise require institutionalization. An estimated six million people benefit from these services. Section 1915 authorizes CMS to permit implementation of changes such as these on an ongoing basis. More comprehensive waivers were authorized by section 1332 the ACA for innovative plans to expand coverage for the overall population.\nHCBS waivers represent a significant part of the Medicaid program, and most are granted under Section 1915(c). The services they cover represent more than half of Medicaid spending on long-term care. Some of them permit access to HCBS for children regardless of family income. Covered services can include assistive technology, behavioral support, communication support, family and caregiver training and support, shift nursing, transportation, and physical, occupational, and speech therapy. HCBS coverage may also be available for children through Medicaid\u2019s Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. Services covered under that program include early detection of conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability and preventive care in addition to medically necessary services.",
              "To fully understand the nature of Medicaid and its variation between states, the obvious structural elements of eligibility and coverage rules tell only part of the story. States can also affect Medicaid\u2019s reach through administrative regulations for obtaining and maintaining enrollment. These rules can create barriers to enrollment with strict requirements that are especially difficult for those with limited financial means to meet. Conversely, they can ease enrollment by permitting more flexibility in compliance. By affecting the size of state Medicaid programs, these rules can shape the implementation of policy goals in a way that largely escapes public notice. A growing body of empirical research has described the nature and extent of their impact.\nCongress has taken two recent steps to limit the impact of administrative requirements as barriers to Medicaid enrollment. The first was enactment of provisions of the Affordable Care Act that directed states to loosen various requirements. The second was provisions of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act that offered states a financial incentive to ease administrative rules and placed a moratorium on disenrollment during the Covid Public Health Emergency. However, restrictive rules returned in many states with the end the Emergency with consequent disenrollment of millions, a poignant demonstration of the importance of administrative requirements as drivers of the size and shape of state Medicaid programs.\nThis Article describes the nature of important administrative requirements that can affect enrollment, reviews empirical evidence of their influence, and proposes three reforms that could dampen the effects of restrictive rules.",
              "This structure has led to considerable variation in Medicaid eligibility between states and between types of beneficiaries. For example, in 2023, the income threshold for parents of dependent children in Alabama was 18% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and 288% of the FPL for children in Minnesota. Variation is even more pronounced in eligibility based on specific conditions.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) reduced the variation in eligibility criteria considerably. It required states to cover all residents whose incomes fell below 133% of the FPL without regard to categories. This meant that adults who are not in families with children could qualify. The federal government pays 90% of the incremental cost. However, participation in the expansion was made voluntary for states by a ruling of the Supreme Court in 2012, so variation remains between the jurisdictions that have accepted it, which currently number forty-one, and those that have not, which currently number ten.\nYet another layer of variation remains beyond the obvious structural elements of eligibility and coverage. To gain and maintain coverage, individuals must comply with numerous administrative requirements that vary across states. Examples include requirements for re-application at regular intervals, for face-to-face interviews as part of the application process, and for asset tests. On first blush, these may appear to be merely technical rules with minimal effect on participation. However, some of them can have a substantial impact that escapes widespread public notice."

These levers change federal exposure and state fiscal risk: enhanced/time\u2011limited matches raise near\u2011term federal costs but create cliffs for states when they expire; waivers allow innovation but can shift long\u2011run fiscal risk to states (node_3).  \n- Data limits/contradiction: the fiscal node did not provide a financing inventory or explicit assessment of these levers\u2019 fiscal impacts (no detailed FMAP or match scenarios in node_2), so mapping design choices to dollar exposures is not possible from the supplied material (node_2 + node_3).  \n- Design choices that reduce fiscal risk: prefer federal allotments or conditional grants for large federal exposure packages; use targeted temporary matches with built\u2011in sunset/trigger rules for scaling; pilot complex expansions via waivers in higher\u2011capacity states to limit immediate federal commitments (node_3).\n\n4) Equity and distributional effects\n- No quantitative distributional estimates across income, age, or geography are available in node_2 (no distributional numbers provided) (node_2).  \n- Program evidence suggests targeted child\u2011 and family\u2011focused interventions (cash, early childhood, SNAP, housing vouchers) tend to yield meaningful benefits for low\u2011income children and families; therefore equity gains are likely concentrated in lower income quintiles and younger cohorts, but geographic variation will matter because FMAPs, state capacity, and enrollment vary (node_3 + node_2) [1][3][2][4].  \n- Recommendation: require distributional reporting (by income quintile, age, and state/territory) as part of any package\u2011level analysis before scale\u2011up (node_2 + node_3).\n\n5) Sequencing and safeguards\n- Recommended rollout sequence: Phase 1 \u2014 pilots/waivers in a subset of higher\u2011capacity states for lower\u2011administrative\u2011burden, high\u2011expected\u2011return interventions; Phase 2 \u2014 targeted scaling with temporary enhanced matches and clear sunset/trigger rules; Phase 3 \u2014 full national scale only after robust net\u2011cost estimates, financing commitments, and safeguards for fiscal cliffs (node_3; sequencing articulated in the synthesis) (node_2 + node_3).  \n- Monitoring & triggers: establish administrative\u2011error and churn benchmarks, monthly fiscal reporting against modeled projections, and automatic review or pause rules if realized net federal cost growth materially exceeds projections \u2014 numeric thresholds cannot be set until node_2 provides modeled central projections and sensitivity ranges (node_2 + node_3).\n\n6) Uncertainties and key risks\n- Largest gap: absence of package\u2011level net federal cost estimates, sensitivity ranges, and modeled offsets from health/earnings in node_2 \u2014 this makes any fiscal judgment provisional (node_2).  \n- Implementation risks: state uptake variation, administrative errors, churn during renewals, and fiscal\u2011cliff exposure from time\u2011limited matches or capped funding, all of which vary by state capacity (node_3).  \n- Contradiction to note: program\u2011level evidence and design levers are described (node_3), but the fiscal node lacks the cost and financing quantification needed to connect those levers to federal budget impacts (node_2); this inconsistency is material to decision\u2011making (node_2 + node_3).\n\n7) Net judgment and conditional recommendation\n- Net judgment: Support conditional substantial expansion only if (a) package\u2011level gross and net federal cost estimates with sensitivity ranges and modeled offsets (health, lifetime earnings) are produced and vetted, and (b) implementation designs explicitly limit federal cliffs and match program choices to state administrative capacity (node_2 + node_3). This mirrors the synthesis recommendation that expansion be conditional on robust fiscal analysis and design safeguards (node_3) (node_2 + node_3).  \n- If those conditions are met, prioritize expansions in cash transfers and early childhood education for scale\u2011up first (strongest long\u2011run evidence) while piloting SNAP and housing scaling in matched demonstrations (node_3), and use federal allotments/conditional grants where federal exposure would otherwise be large (node_3).\n\n8) Follow\u2011up analytic questions (top 3)\n- Produce package\u2011level fiscal models: estimate gross federal costs, present\u2011value net costs, sensitivity ranges, and modeled offsets from health and lifetime earnings for candidate packages (motivated by the missing fiscal quantification in node_2) (node_2).  \n- Harmonize cost\u2011effectiveness metrics: compute $ per schooling\u2011year, $ per QALY (or DALY averted), and present\u2011value net federal cost per outcome for prioritized programs and report by income quintile and state (motivated by node_3\u2019s call for harmonized metrics and node_2\u2019s missing numbers) (node_3 + node_2).  \n- Pilot implementation and state capacity tests: design 1115/1915(c)/1332 pilots stratified by state administrative capacity to measure churn, error rates, and realized costs before national scaling (motivated by implementation constraints and sequencing guidance in node_3) (node_3)."

              "To what extent does the research on the long-run effects of the social safety net line up with these predictions? First, there is consistent evidence that social safety net investments during childhood lead to improved adult human capital and economic outcomes as well as health. Aizer (2016) examine an early 20th century cash welfare program and find that additional income in childhood leads to greater educational attainment, income, body weight, and life expectancy. Increased family resources during childhood through the Earned Income Tax Credit have been shown to increase children\u2019s cognitive outcomes (; , ) as well as educational attainment and employment in young adulthood (). While perhaps less mechanistically connected to the increase in resources from these near-cash programs, related work shows that public investments through Head Start preschools and Medicaid also lead to improvements in adult human capital and health. The evidence on the relative importance of exposure is more mixed. show the beneficial effects of Food Stamps on adult metabolic health derive from exposure prior to age five. Aizer (2016) provide suggestive evidence that the positive effects of cash welfare may be larger for children exposed at younger ages. , however, find that larger EITC payments during the teen years, rather than early childhood, drive the increases in educational attainment and earnings in young adulthood.\nAnother mechanism for long-run effects of Food Stamps is a reduction in stress. Recent work shows that lower socio-economic status may be causally related to stress hormones ( cortisol) and that additional resources may attenuate this relationship (; ; ). In turn, and document that in utero exposure to maternal stress has adverse impacts on children\u2019s short- and long-term outcomes."

              "Now that this brief has addressed core characteristics of cash transfer programs, what does the literature say about their effectiveness? This is a challenging question, because cash transfer programs are necessarily context-dependent ([Zhao et al., 2023 [Ch. 2]](https://utorontopress.com/9781487545178/cash-transfers-for-inclusive-societies/); ). Each program unfolds in a specific social context with unique eligibility criteria and disbursements, all of which influence generalizability. Moreover, the specific objectives of a program (e.g., reducing the number of nights spent homeless vs. improving child nutrition) inform its methods (e.g., cash plus housing vouchers vs. cash plus child healthcare access). \nNonetheless, researchers have reported on the general impacts of cash transfers by looking across many programs and summarizing findings using meta-analysis or systematic review. These studies have largely supported the efficacy of conditional and unconditional cash transfers in lifting individuals out of poverty and improving a range of positive outcomes.",
              "Conditional cash transfer programs have mostly been implemented in low- and middle-income countries, targeting families with young children. The short term effectiveness of these programs has been well established, with reviews showing that conditional cash transfers raise savings and investments by around 10-20% of the size of the transfer without reducing labor force participation (), positively influence household consumption by better balancing spending and saving (), and increase the use of preventative health services while improving objective and subjective health (). Regarding young children, conditional cash transfers lower rates of child labor, particularly for boys (), improve school enrollment and attendance (), increase the uptake of maternal and newborn health services (), and generally benefit child health by improving access to care, increasing child and maternal nutrition and immunizations, and reducing morbidity risk and household poverty (). Conditional cash transfers may be more effective in middle-income (vs. low-income) countries, as these countries more often have functional health systems that recipients can use their cash to access (; ).\nSome reviews have tried to estimate the longer-term effects of conditional cash transfers, asking whether these programs break intergenerational cycles of poverty. Evidence for this is considerably more mixed: conditional cash transfers appear to provide some important long-term impacts on schooling, but evidence for other outcomes is limited due to methodological challenges or weak/non-existent long-term impacts ().",
              "In sum, both conditional and unconditional cash transfers appear effective at improving a range of financial, health, and education outcomes. Conditional programs have a longer research history and are mostly conducted in low- and middle-income countries, whereas unconditional programs are relatively newer approaches favored by Western nations like the U.S. and Canada. Although most evidence is on individuals in poverty (rather than individuals experiencing homelessness), recent reviews suggest that programs are most beneficial for the poorest and most vulnerable recipients (Neighly et al., 2022). This suggests that these programs may be highly effective in helping people experiencing homelessness, and two pioneering programs in the U.S. and Canada are now directly testing these questions.\n## What are some examples of direct cash transfer programs targeting people experiencing homelessness?\nAs referenced earlier, , , and the maintain databases of active and past cash transfer programs. Honing in on Community Solutions\u2019 interests, this research brief describes two pilot cash transfer programs aimed at individuals experiencing homelessness, one in and one in the , as well as a related program using \u201cCentralized Diversion Funds\u201d in the .\n### New Leaf Project, Vancouver, B.C."

              "Further research is needed to better understand the characteristics of cash transfer programs that facilitate access to child care and support employment. While traditional economic theory predicts (and have suggested) that unconditional cash transfers will lead to a decline in labor force participation, more recent studies of the employment effects of the \u2014as well as a similar [child benefit program in Canada](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28556/w28556.pdf) that used real-world data and a \u2014found no evidence of a negative labor market response. Meanwhile, the decision to enter the labor force or increase the number of hours worked is complex for parents of young children. A [recent review of the research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-016-9331-3) on child care use and labor force participation among parents of young children suggests that increased access to child care\u2014through reduced out-of-pocket costs or increased availability of public early care and education programs\u2014has positive impacts on maternal labor force participation and work hours; however, the findings also point to considerable variation across different family situations.\nAs this brief has illustrated, the evidence base indicates that cash transfers support infant and toddler development and address an ongoing need for American families with low incomes. Families with low incomes often need additional income support to meet their family\u2019s basic needs; cash transfers do this effectively by allowing families the how to spend their payments to reduce the stressors associated with having a low income and best support their children\u2019s development. To help federal, state, and local policymakers craft new\u2014and strengthen existing\u2014cash transfer initiatives that support infant and toddler development and well-being, we provide four policy recommendations.",
              "Policymakers should implement cash transfer programs as a supplement to existing social safety net programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, and housing subsidies. At present, most cash transfer programs like the EITC and expanded CTC are, alone, not sufficient to meet the full needs of families with infants and toddlers. Instead, they allow families the flexibility to meet needs that are unsupported by other parts of the social safety net. Policymakers should consider cash transfer programs to be one of several important tools in the poverty reduction toolbox and implement them as part of a comprehensive approach to poverty reduction. Furthermore, the impact of poverty reduction strategies such as cash transfers when used in combination with other strategies to lift families out of poverty. In order to effectively combine policy reduction strategies, policymakers should also ensure that, when implementing cash transfer programs, cash transfer benefits families\u2019 eligibility for other benefits.\nThis brief was a team effort.

              "## The Evidence on Cash Transfers\nWhile on the impact of cash transfers continues to build\u2014and there is still much to learn about what benefit amounts are effective, for whom, and in what contexts\u2014there is nonetheless a strong and compelling evidence base, laid out in this section, that cash transfers can effectively support the heathy development and well-being of young children and lay the foundation for improved outcomes throughout children\u2019s lifetimes. Indeed, a of a U.S. child allowance\u2014based on a systematic review of the evidence for the effects of cash transfers on child development and later outcomes\u2014found that a $1,000 increase in family income in one year for a single-parent family with one child generated social benefits five times greater than the initial investment (via reduced health care costs, crime, need for child protection services, etc.).\n### Cash transfers help parents with low incomes meet the essential needs of infants and toddlers.\nParents with low incomes who have infants and toddlers face barriers in meeting their children\u2019s essential needs, such as reliable nutrition and stable housing. The importance of for young children ; however, of all infants and toddlers nationally are growing up with low or very low food security, meaning that their families needed to reduce the quality and/or the quantity of food in their diets due to budgetary restrictions. , for young children is also linked to healthy child development, yet compared to infants and toddlers in families with higher incomes, those in families with low incomes were twice as likely to experience housing insecurity (4% and 2%, respectively) and three times as likely to live in crowded housing ( respectively), likely due to limited availability of ."

              "##  Cash transfer programs in the United States: Effects on child and adolescent mental health\nIn the United States, support for low\u2010income families is primarily in the form of in\u2010kind transfers such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid and housing assistance (e.g., the Housing Choice Voucher Program; Pilkauskas, Jacob, Rhodes, Richard, & Shaefer, ). In\u2010kind transfers have demonstrable benefits for families (Ellen, ; McKernan, Ratcliffe, & Braga, ; Schwartz, Horn, Ellen, & Cordes, ; Shaefer & Gutierrez, ) and there is growing interest in the United States in combining these forms of assistance with conditional and unconditional cash payments (Gennetian, Shafir, Aber, & De Hoop, ; National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, ).\nCash transfer programs typically take one of three forms in the United States: (1) tax credits for lower\u2010income working families, including the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit; (2) payments to eligible households from industry\u2010related cash distributions, such as payments to Native American households from casino profits or to Alaska state residents from the trans\u2010Alaska oil pipeline and (3) and direct cash payments to low\u2010income and other vulnerable groups through guaranteed income programs.

The first three groups used various research designs and data sources; we describe the methods and scope and highlight key challenges to determining and interpreting causal effects. The final set of studies (GI RCTs) have not measured impacts on child abuse and neglect; nevertheless, they provide insight into how cash affects parental stress, mental health, and financial security\u2014the very mechanisms through which income is expected to reduce maltreatment.\nAll these programs provide direct financial assistance, but they vary in design. TANF is a federal block grant program that gives funding to states to provide cash aid and other support to low-income families with children, with benefits that are time limited and accompanied by work requirements. More than half of TANF cases are child only\u2014that is, benefits are provided solely on the child\u2019s behalf. These cases are typically exempt from work requirements or time limits.\nSNAP offers monthly benefits to help households purchase food. The EITC is a refundable federal tax credit, and many states have supplemental EITCs that may or may not be refundable. These credits are typically accessible to working families with low-to-moderate incomes. The CTC is a tax credit provided to nearly all tax filers with dependent children. A portion of the credit is \u201crefundable,\u201d meaning families with little or no tax liability can still receive cash back from the government. By contrast, GI programs provide unconditional cash payments directly to individuals or families without restrictions on how the money is spent."

              "## How is the Medicaid program financed?\nUnlike Medicare, which is run by the federal government, Medicaid is jointly financed and jointly administered by states, territories, and the federal government. Since the Medicaid program was created in 1965, the federal government has matched state spending on Medicaid services and other costs by contributing a certain percentage of funds. This percentage \u2013 which is called the federal medical assistance percentage, or FMAP \u2013 is calculated using a formula defined by Congress that compares each state\u2019s rolling three-year average per capita income to the United States\u2019 per capita income. This results in states with lower per capita incomes receiving a higher contribution rate and states with higher per capita incomes receiving a lower contribution rate; all states have a maximum FMAP rate of 83 percent and a minimum FMAP rate of 50 percent for this base FMAP.\nMedicaid\u2019s financing structure [can be traced to its roots](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4194918/) in the public assistance system. In 1950, Congress passed a [set of amendments to the Social Security Act](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v13n10/v13n10p3.pdf) to provide states with federal matching funds for certain medical services provided to individuals who were receiving cash assistance. Then, in 1960, the Kerr-Mills Act created the Medical Assistance for the Aged program, which for health care services for certain older adults. When Congress created the Medicaid and Medicare programs through the [Social Security Amendments of 1965](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-79/pdf/STATUTE-79-Pg286.pdf), they retained the federal-state financing structure of the Kerr-Mills Act and adopted the FMAP formula that is still used today.",
              "The federal match rate for most Medicaid-covered services follows this statutorily defined formula. However, , including different FMAP rates for certain populations, providers, and activities. Congress often uses higher \u2013 or \u201cenhanced\u201d \u2013 FMAP rates to states and territories to cover certain services or populations or, alternatively, FMAP reductions to penalize states for not complying with federal requirements. For example, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 [created a time-limited FMAP increase](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/home-community-based-services/guidance-additional-resources/strengthening-and-investing-home-and-community-based-services-for-medicaid-beneficiaries-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-section-9817/index.html) for activities that \u201cenhance, expand, or strengthen\u201d home and community-based services. Congress has also used FMAP enhancements to provide broader fiscal relief to states and territories, including through a .\nImportantly, the five U.S. Territories \u2013 American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands \u2013 have a than the states. The territories\u2019 FMAP rate is set by Congress, instead of using the FMAP formula defined in statute. Historically, the Territories\u2019 FMAP rates were all set at 55%. , Congress permanently increased the FMAP rate to 83% for American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and temporarily increased Puerto Rico\u2019s FMAP to 76%. Additionally, the territories\u2019 federal funding is capped, meaning that once the territories reach their funding allotments each year, they must use entirely local funds to pay for Medicaid-covered services or take steps to manage the lack of additional federal funds, such as reducing the benefits they cover or pausing payments to providers.",
              "How do states and territories fund the \u201cstate share\u201d \u2013 or nonfederal portion \u2013 of Medicaid costs? [According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO)](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-98), in 2018, 68 percent of state share came from state general revenue (which includes state income tax, sales tax, property tax, and fees), while the remaining 32 percent came from local government, taxes on providers, and other sources. As explored below, both federal match and state share play important roles in a state\u2019s budget.\nWhy is Medicaid important to state and territory budgets?\nMedicaid plays a significant role in state and territory budgets. [According to the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO)](https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NASBO/9d2d2db1-c943-4f1b-b750-0fca152d64c2/UploadedImages/SER%20Archive/2024_SER/2024_State_Expenditure_Report_S.pdf), Medicaid was the largest total spending category for states in FY2024, representing about 30 percent of total state expenditures from all sources. However, it is important to note that federal funds \u2013 including federal Medicaid matching funds \u2013 are included in this calculation; when looking only at state general fund expenditures, Medicaid\u2019s footprint shrinks, representing 18.7 percent of general fund expenditures. This is still a substantial share of state resources, coming second only to education, meaning Medicaid plays a central role in state budget processes."

The match rate for most Medicaid enrollees is determined by a formula in the law that provides a match of at least 50% and provides a higher federal match rate for states with lower per capita income (Figure 5). States may receive a higher match rate for certain services and populations. The ACA expansion group is financed with a 90% federal match rate, so states pay 10%, and the American Rescue Plan Act included an additional to states that newly adopt the Medicaid expansion; however, the tax and spending law eliminated the incentive, effective January 1, 2026. In FY 2023, Medicaid spending totaled of which was federal spending. Medicaid typically accelerates during economic downturns as enrollment increases. Spending growth also peaked after the implementation of the ACA and, more recently, due to enrollment growth tied to the pandemic-related continuous enrollment provision.\nOverall, Medicaid accounts for a large share of most states\u2019 budgets and is often central to state fiscal decisions; however, state spending on Medicaid is second to state spending on elementary and secondary education, and the program is also the largest source of federal revenue for states. In 3, Medicaid accounted for 30% of total state expenditures, 15% of expenditures from state funds (general funds and other funds), and 57% of expenditures from federal funds received by the state.",

Section 1115 waivers have been used over time and generally reflect priorities identified by the states as well as from one presidential administration to another (Figure 18). Waivers have been to expand coverage or benefits, change policies for existing Medicaid populations (e.g., testing premiums or other eligibility requirements), modify delivery systems, restructure financing or authorize new payments (e.g., supplemental payments or incentive-based payments), as well as make other program changes.",

The first Trump administration\u2019s Section 1115 waiver policy emphasized and other eligibility restrictions, payment for institutional behavioral health services, and capped financing. The Biden administration withdrew waiver approvals with work requirements, phased out approval of premium requirements, and instead states to propose waivers that expand coverage, reduce health disparities, advance \u201cwhole-person care,\u201d and improve access to behavioral health care. Areas of focus during the included leveraging Medicaid to address (including housing instability, homelessness, nutrition insecurity) and to provide health care to individuals back into the community.

Recent actions from the new Trump administration could signal efforts to curtail waivers related to of health, and to limit 1115 waiver and flexibility. In addition, several states are seeking approval for work requirements waivers. Although the tax and spending reconciliation law now includes a national work requirement, some states may continue to pursue waivers to implement work requirements prior to January 1, 2027 when the national requirement goes into effect.\nVarious types of waivers and other emergency authorities can also be used to respond to emergencies. These can help expand Medicaid capacity and focus on specific services, providers, or groups of enrollees that may be particularly impacted.

              "Starting in the 1970s, Congress extended Medicaid coverage to new kinds of beneficiaries by granting states flexibility to provide benefits in nontraditional ways. This was accomplished by permitting CMS to waive various operational requirements on states for providing benefits. These waivers are permitted primarily under two sections of the Social Security Act. Section 1115 authorizes CMS to allow experiments through demonstration programs. These may be used for testing alternative forms of payment, such as managed care and prospective payment for hospitals, and for alternative care arrangements, such as expanded access to home and community-based services (HCBS) for beneficiaries who would otherwise require institutionalization. An estimated six million people benefit from these services. Section 1915 authorizes CMS to permit implementation of changes such as these on an ongoing basis. More comprehensive waivers were authorized by section 1332 the ACA for innovative plans to expand coverage for the overall population.\nHCBS waivers represent a significant part of the Medicaid program, and most are granted under Section 1915(c). The services they cover represent more than half of Medicaid spending on long-term care. Some of them permit access to HCBS for children regardless of family income. Covered services can include assistive technology, behavioral support, communication support, family and caregiver training and support, shift nursing, transportation, and physical, occupational, and speech therapy. HCBS coverage may also be available for children through Medicaid\u2019s Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. Services covered under that program include early detection of conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability and preventive care in addition to medically necessary services.",
              "To fully understand the nature of Medicaid and its variation between states, the obvious structural elements of eligibility and coverage rules tell only part of the story. States can also affect Medicaid\u2019s reach through administrative regulations for obtaining and maintaining enrollment. These rules can create barriers to enrollment with strict requirements that are especially difficult for those with limited financial means to meet. Conversely, they can ease enrollment by permitting more flexibility in compliance. By affecting the size of state Medicaid programs, these rules can shape the implementation of policy goals in a way that largely escapes public notice. A growing body of empirical research has described the nature and extent of their impact.\nCongress has taken two recent steps to limit the impact of administrative requirements as barriers to Medicaid enrollment. The first was enactment of provisions of the Affordable Care Act that directed states to loosen various requirements. The second was provisions of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act that offered states a financial incentive to ease administrative rules and placed a moratorium on disenrollment during the Covid Public Health Emergency. However, restrictive rules returned in many states with the end the Emergency with consequent disenrollment of millions, a poignant demonstration of the importance of administrative requirements as drivers of the size and shape of state Medicaid programs.\nThis Article describes the nature of important administrative requirements that can affect enrollment, reviews empirical evidence of their influence, and proposes three reforms that could dampen the effects of restrictive rules.",
              "This structure has led to considerable variation in Medicaid eligibility between states and between types of beneficiaries. For example, in 2023, the income threshold for parents of dependent children in Alabama was 18% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and 288% of the FPL for children in Minnesota. Variation is even more pronounced in eligibility based on specific conditions.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) reduced the variation in eligibility criteria considerably. It required states to cover all residents whose incomes fell below 133% of the FPL without regard to categories. This meant that adults who are not in families with children could qualify. The federal government pays 90% of the incremental cost. However, participation in the expansion was made voluntary for states by a ruling of the Supreme Court in 2012, so variation remains between the jurisdictions that have accepted it, which currently number forty-one, and those that have not, which currently number ten.\nYet another layer of variation remains beyond the obvious structural elements of eligibility and coverage. To gain and maintain coverage, individuals must comply with numerous administrative requirements that vary across states. Examples include requirements for re-application at regular intervals, for face-to-face interviews as part of the application process, and for asset tests. On first blush, these may appear to be merely technical rules with minimal effect on participation. However, some of them can have a substantial impact that escapes widespread public notice."

territories face special FMAP/funding caps that raise fiscal risk; enhanced/time\u2011limited matches create \u201ccliffs\u201d when they expire [1][2][1] (node_3).\n  - Waiver and grant levers: section 1115, 1915(c), and 1332 waivers let states redesign benefits/delivery but can shift long\u2011run fiscal risk to states if federal financing is capped; grant/match structures and enrollment/determination rules materially affect program size and administrative burden (node_3) [2][3].\n  - Political/administrative feasibility: changes that require statutory changes (e.g., new enhanced FMAP levels or tax law changes) need Congressional action; waivers and administrative rule changes can be used more rapidly but may transfer risk to states (node_3).\n- Dependence on federal\u2013state implementation: any financing option that assumes federal grants or matching rates depends on states\u2019 capacity to implement and on waiver designs that allocate fiscal risk\u2014these implementation linkages are described in node_3 (node_3).\n\n5) Implementation and design implications\n- Federal\u2013state design options (node_3): FMAP adjustments (floor/cap; enhanced/time\u2011limited matches), waiver strategies (section 1115, 1915(c), 1332) to redesign benefits/delivery/financing, and choices about grant versus allotment structures and enrollment/renewal rules (continuous enrollment, interview/asset tests) (node_3) [2][3][1].\n- Fiscal and administrative implications and variation by state capacity (node_3):\n  - Enhanced/time\u2011limited matches shift near\u2011term federal costs but introduce fiscal cliffs for states when they expire; territories face capped funding and greater risk (node_3) [1][2].\n  - Complex demonstrations (1115, 1332) enable innovation but require higher administrative capacity and can transfer long\u2011run fiscal risk to states; low\u2011capacity states face higher implementation costs and higher risk of coverage loss during unwinds (node_3) [2][3].\n  - Enrollment/renewal rules and supplemental financing affect churn and program size\u2014simpler rules reduce churn but may raise gross costs (node_3) [1][3].\n- Mapping design options to packages: cannot map design options to specific prioritized packages because node_2 did not supply package identities, costs, or scenario details needed to choose the least\u2011risky design per package (node_2; node_3). Once node_2 provides package cost profiles, match:\n  - packages with large federal exposure \u2192 prefer federal allotments with conditional federal funding and legislative protections (node_3; pending node_2 cost data);\n  - smaller, targeted pilots \u2192 prefer waivers/demonstrations that limit federal fiscal commitment (node_3; pending node_2).\n\n6) Harmonized cost\u2011effectiveness and distributional ranking\n- Metrics to use (from node_3): cost\u2011per\u2011schooling\u2011year, lifetime\u2011earnings gain, and health\u2011adjusted outcomes (cost\u2011per\u2011QALY or DALY averted), with stratification by income quintile and geography to capture FMAP and enrollment heterogeneity (node_3) [1][3][2][4].\n- Cannot produce ranked list: node_2 did not provide the cost inputs or offsets required to compute cost\u2011effectiveness or distributional rankings, so rankings by cost\u2011effectiveness or equity impact cannot be calculated (node_2; node_3).\n- Recommended approach once inputs available: compute present\u2011value net federal cost per metric unit (e.g., $ per QALY, $ per schooling year), report ranges by scenario and by income/geography, and flag packages where the chevronic tradeoff between fiscal cheapest and largest equity gains diverges (node_3; requires node_2 inputs).\n\n7) Implementation sequencing and phasing\n- Sequencing principles (node_3): prioritize pilots/phases that (a) have high expected cost\u2011effectiveness under harmonized metrics, (b) impose low administrative burden and minimal state capacity requirements, and (c) avoid large short\u2011term federal cliffs (node_3).\n- Specific recommendations (conditional on node_2 cost exposure):\n  - Phase 1 (pilot/early scale): low\u2011administrative\u2011burden, high\u2011equity interventions deployable via waivers or conditional grants in a subset of states (node_3; requires node_2 cost data for selection).\n  - Phase 2 (state scaling): interventions needing moderate state admin capacity use enhanced temporary matches or targeted grants with built\u2011in sunset/trigger rules (node_3; pending node_2).\n  - Phase 3 (full scale): fiscally large or complex packages only after robust cost estimates, legislative financing, and safeguards for fiscal cliffs (node_2; node_3).\n- Federal implementation tools suggested by node_3: conditional grants, temporary enhanced matching rates (Congressional action for match changes), and time\u2011limited waivers/demonstrations to test delivery models (node_3).\n\n8) Sensitivity, risk, and monitoring triggers\n- Key uncertainties and risks:\n  - Missing fiscal uncertainty: no sensitivity ranges for costs or offsets were provided, so fiscal uncertainty cannot be bounded (node_2).\n  - Implementation risks: state uptake variation, administrative errors, churn during renewals, and fiscal\u2011cliff exposure from time\u2011limited matches or capped funding (node_3) [1][3][2].\n- Monitoring/triggers (proposed qualitative triggers now; numeric thresholds require node_2 inputs):\n  - Pause expansion or scale back if observed administrative error rates or churn exceed state\u2011specific operational benchmarks (rationale from node_3; numeric thresholds require node_2 cost/sensitivity inputs).\n  - Require automatic review if realized net federal cost growth exceeds modeled central projections by X% \u2014 X cannot be set until node_2 provides modeled central projections and sensitivity ranges (node_2; node_3).\n  - Tie sunset/extension of enhanced matches to measured outcomes on coverage, cost\u2011per\u2011QALY, and state fiscal stress indicators (node_3; cost thresholds need node_2).\n- Data needed to operationalize triggers: package\u2011level modeled central and scenario costs, realized monthly fiscal reports, administrative error/churn rates by state (node_2; node_3).\n\n9) Final policy packages and recommended financing/implementation pairing\n- Cannot produce a prioritized top 3\u20135 list of concrete packages with financing mixes and net\u2011cost ranges because node_2 did not analyze or name prioritized expansion packages nor provide cost inputs (node_2).\n- Interim recommended decision rule for selecting top packages (using node_3 design levers and to be informed by node_2 costs):\n  - Select packages with the highest projected equity impact per dollar (using node_3 metrics) and with delivery paths compatible with a state\u2019s administrative capacity (node_3); finalize financing mixes only after node_2 cost and offset estimates are provided so percent coverage by taxes/borrowing/repurposing can be computed (node_2; node_3).\n- Example preferred implementation features (illustrative, using node_3 levers): for a high\u2011impact, administratively simple child benefit expansion use federal allotments with conditional matching and continuous enrollment provisions for the poorest quintiles (node_3); for complex HCBS expansions pilot via 1915/1115 demonstrations in higher\u2011capacity states before scaling (node_3). Financing shares and net cost ranges cannot be stated until node_2 supplies package cost figures (node_2; node_3).\n\n10) Gaps, caveats, and next analytic steps\n- Key missing evidence from node_2 (explicitly reported by node_2): no package\u2011level net\u2011federal cost estimates, no sensitivity ranges, no offsets from health or lifetime earnings, and no feasibility assessment of specific financing options \u2014 these gaps prevent fiscal quantification and financing mapping (node_2).\n- Secondary gaps or limitations in node_3: while program design levers and metrics are well specified, node_3 does not supply the package\u2011level cost inputs or empirical parameter estimates needed to quantify cost\u2011effectiveness or simulate fiscal cliffs across states (node_3).\n- Recommended next steps (targeted analyses and pilots):\n  - Produce package\u2011level fiscal models that estimate gross federal costs, modeled offsets (health, earnings), and sensitivity ranges under specified behavioral/timing assumptions (responds to node_2 gaps).\n  - Use node_3\u2019s harmonized metrics to evaluate packages once cost inputs exist; run distributional simulations by income quintile and state/territory (node_3).\n  - Pilot priority packages in a subset of states stratified by administrative capacity using waivers or conditional grants; collect administrative\u2011error, churn, and outcome data to refine scale\u2011up decisions (node_3).\n  - Model financing scenarios (taxes, transfers, borrowing, repurposing) tied to package costs to estimate shares covered under central and stressed scenarios (requires node_2 cost outputs).\n- Summary caveat: substantive policy judgment about whether to \u201csubstantially increase\u201d social services cannot be reached without the package\u2011level fiscal inputs and sensitivity analysis node_2 identified as missing; implementation design rules and metric frameworks in node_3 enable rigorous evaluation once those fiscal inputs are supplied (node_2; node_3)."

              "## How is the Medicaid program financed?\nUnlike Medicare, which is run by the federal government, Medicaid is jointly financed and jointly administered by states, territories, and the federal government. Since the Medicaid program was created in 1965, the federal government has matched state spending on Medicaid services and other costs by contributing a certain percentage of funds. This percentage \u2013 which is called the federal medical assistance percentage, or FMAP \u2013 is calculated using a formula defined by Congress that compares each state\u2019s rolling three-year average per capita income to the United States\u2019 per capita income. This results in states with lower per capita incomes receiving a higher contribution rate and states with higher per capita incomes receiving a lower contribution rate; all states have a maximum FMAP rate of 83 percent and a minimum FMAP rate of 50 percent for this base FMAP.\nMedicaid\u2019s financing structure [can be traced to its roots](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4194918/) in the public assistance system. In 1950, Congress passed a [set of amendments to the Social Security Act](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v13n10/v13n10p3.pdf) to provide states with federal matching funds for certain medical services provided to individuals who were receiving cash assistance. Then, in 1960, the Kerr-Mills Act created the Medical Assistance for the Aged program, which for health care services for certain older adults. When Congress created the Medicaid and Medicare programs through the [Social Security Amendments of 1965](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-79/pdf/STATUTE-79-Pg286.pdf), they retained the federal-state financing structure of the Kerr-Mills Act and adopted the FMAP formula that is still used today.",
              "The federal match rate for most Medicaid-covered services follows this statutorily defined formula. However, , including different FMAP rates for certain populations, providers, and activities. Congress often uses higher \u2013 or \u201cenhanced\u201d \u2013 FMAP rates to states and territories to cover certain services or populations or, alternatively, FMAP reductions to penalize states for not complying with federal requirements. For example, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 [created a time-limited FMAP increase](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/home-community-based-services/guidance-additional-resources/strengthening-and-investing-home-and-community-based-services-for-medicaid-beneficiaries-american-rescue-plan-act-of-2021-section-9817/index.html) for activities that \u201cenhance, expand, or strengthen\u201d home and community-based services. Congress has also used FMAP enhancements to provide broader fiscal relief to states and territories, including through a .\nImportantly, the five U.S. Territories \u2013 American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands \u2013 have a than the states. The territories\u2019 FMAP rate is set by Congress, instead of using the FMAP formula defined in statute. Historically, the Territories\u2019 FMAP rates were all set at 55%. , Congress permanently increased the FMAP rate to 83% for American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and temporarily increased Puerto Rico\u2019s FMAP to 76%. Additionally, the territories\u2019 federal funding is capped, meaning that once the territories reach their funding allotments each year, they must use entirely local funds to pay for Medicaid-covered services or take steps to manage the lack of additional federal funds, such as reducing the benefits they cover or pausing payments to providers.",
              "How do states and territories fund the \u201cstate share\u201d \u2013 or nonfederal portion \u2013 of Medicaid costs? [According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO)](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-98), in 2018, 68 percent of state share came from state general revenue (which includes state income tax, sales tax, property tax, and fees), while the remaining 32 percent came from local government, taxes on providers, and other sources. As explored below, both federal match and state share play important roles in a state\u2019s budget.\nWhy is Medicaid important to state and territory budgets?\nMedicaid plays a significant role in state and territory budgets. [According to the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO)](https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NASBO/9d2d2db1-c943-4f1b-b750-0fca152d64c2/UploadedImages/SER%20Archive/2024_SER/2024_State_Expenditure_Report_S.pdf), Medicaid was the largest total spending category for states in FY2024, representing about 30 percent of total state expenditures from all sources. However, it is important to note that federal funds \u2013 including federal Medicaid matching funds \u2013 are included in this calculation; when looking only at state general fund expenditures, Medicaid\u2019s footprint shrinks, representing 18.7 percent of general fund expenditures. This is still a substantial share of state resources, coming second only to education, meaning Medicaid plays a central role in state budget processes."

              "States are without a cap for qualified services provided to eligible enrollees. The match rate for most Medicaid enrollees is determined by a formula in the law that provides a match of at least 50% and provides a higher federal match rate for states with lower per capita income (Figure 5). States may receive a higher match rate for certain services and populations. The ACA expansion group is financed with a 90% federal match rate, so states pay 10%, and the American Rescue Plan Act included an additional to states that newly adopt the Medicaid expansion; however, the tax and spending law eliminated the incentive, effective January 1, 2026. In FY 2023, Medicaid spending totaled of which was federal spending. Medicaid typically accelerates during economic downturns as enrollment increases. Spending growth also peaked after the implementation of the ACA and, more recently, due to enrollment growth tied to the pandemic-related continuous enrollment provision.\nOverall, Medicaid accounts for a large share of most states\u2019 budgets and is often central to state fiscal decisions; however, state spending on Medicaid is second to state spending on elementary and secondary education, and the program is also the largest source of federal revenue for states. In 3, Medicaid accounted for 30% of total state expenditures, 15% of expenditures from state funds (general funds and other funds), and 57% of expenditures from federal funds received by the state.",

Section 1115 waivers have been used over time and generally reflect priorities identified by the states as well as from one presidential administration to another (Figure 18). Waivers have been to expand coverage or benefits, change policies for existing Medicaid populations (e.g., testing premiums or other eligibility requirements), modify delivery systems, restructure financing or authorize new payments (e.g., supplemental payments or incentive-based payments), as well as make other program changes.",

The first Trump administration\u2019s Section 1115 waiver policy emphasized and other eligibility restrictions, payment for institutional behavioral health services, and capped financing.

In addition, several states are seeking approval for work requirements waivers. Although the tax and spending reconciliation law now includes a national work requirement, some states may continue to pursue waivers to implement work requirements prior to January 1, 2027 when the national requirement goes into effect.\nVarious types of waivers and other emergency authorities can also be used to respond to emergencies.

              "Starting in the 1970s, Congress extended Medicaid coverage to new kinds of beneficiaries by granting states flexibility to provide benefits in nontraditional ways. This was accomplished by permitting CMS to waive various operational requirements on states for providing benefits. These waivers are permitted primarily under two sections of the Social Security Act. Section 1115 authorizes CMS to allow experiments through demonstration programs. These may be used for testing alternative forms of payment, such as managed care and prospective payment for hospitals, and for alternative care arrangements, such as expanded access to home and community-based services (HCBS) for beneficiaries who would otherwise require institutionalization. An estimated six million people benefit from these services. Section 1915 authorizes CMS to permit implementation of changes such as these on an ongoing basis. More comprehensive waivers were authorized by section 1332 the ACA for innovative plans to expand coverage for the overall population.\nHCBS waivers represent a significant part of the Medicaid program, and most are granted under Section 1915(c). The services they cover represent more than half of Medicaid spending on long-term care. Some of them permit access to HCBS for children regardless of family income. Covered services can include assistive technology, behavioral support, communication support, family and caregiver training and support, shift nursing, transportation, and physical, occupational, and speech therapy. HCBS coverage may also be available for children through Medicaid\u2019s Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. Services covered under that program include early detection of conditions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability and preventive care in addition to medically necessary services.",
              "To fully understand the nature of Medicaid and its variation between states, the obvious structural elements of eligibility and coverage rules tell only part of the story. States can also affect Medicaid\u2019s reach through administrative regulations for obtaining and maintaining enrollment. These rules can create barriers to enrollment with strict requirements that are especially difficult for those with limited financial means to meet. Conversely, they can ease enrollment by permitting more flexibility in compliance. By affecting the size of state Medicaid programs, these rules can shape the implementation of policy goals in a way that largely escapes public notice. A growing body of empirical research has described the nature and extent of their impact.\nCongress has taken two recent steps to limit the impact of administrative requirements as barriers to Medicaid enrollment. The first was enactment of provisions of the Affordable Care Act that directed states to loosen various requirements. The second was provisions of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act that offered states a financial incentive to ease administrative rules and placed a moratorium on disenrollment during the Covid Public Health Emergency. However, restrictive rules returned in many states with the end the Emergency with consequent disenrollment of millions, a poignant demonstration of the importance of administrative requirements as drivers of the size and shape of state Medicaid programs.\nThis Article describes the nature of important administrative requirements that can affect enrollment, reviews empirical evidence of their influence, and proposes three reforms that could dampen the effects of restrictive rules.",
              "This structure has led to considerable variation in Medicaid eligibility between states and between types of beneficiaries. For example, in 2023, the income threshold for parents of dependent children in Alabama was 18% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and 288% of the FPL for children in Minnesota. Variation is even more pronounced in eligibility based on specific conditions.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) reduced the variation in eligibility criteria considerably. It required states to cover all residents whose incomes fell below 133% of the FPL without regard to categories. This meant that adults who are not in families with children could qualify. The federal government pays 90% of the incremental cost. However, participation in the expansion was made voluntary for states by a ruling of the Supreme Court in 2012, so variation remains between the jurisdictions that have accepted it, which currently number forty-one, and those that have not, which currently number ten.\nYet another layer of variation remains beyond the obvious structural elements of eligibility and coverage. To gain and maintain coverage, individuals must comply with numerous administrative requirements that vary across states. Examples include requirements for re-application at regular intervals, for face-to-face interviews as part of the application process, and for asset tests. On first blush, these may appear to be merely technical rules with minimal effect on participation. However, some of them can have a substantial impact that escapes widespread public notice."

              "And within these Medicaid expansion states, 12 states have legislative \u201ctrigger provisions\u201d that were an attempt by state legislators to protect state budgets (and state politics) from reductions in federal Medicaid funding for the expansion when they enacted new coverage. In addition, three states passed Medicaid expansion by constitutional amendment without such trigger language. I have [provided an overview of these provisions before](https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2024/11/27/federal-funding-cuts-to-medicaid-may-trigger-automatic-loss-of-health-coverage-for-millions-of-residents-of-certain-states/) and this week [I wrote about the operation of these statutes and constitutional amendments](https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2025/04/28/cuts-to-acas-medicaid-expansion-under-consideration-by-congress-would-lead-to-large-coverage-losses-hitting-some-states-harder-than-others/) should Congress substantially cut Medicaid expansion funding. My colleague Edwin Park [also reviewed one proposal to cut federal Medicaid expansion funding](https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2025/04/28/new-state-by-state-estimates-of-the-federal-funding-cuts-from-imposing-a-per-capita-cap-on-the-medicaid-expansion/) through a per capita cap and how both imposing a per capita cap on expansion and directly cutting the federal matching rate (the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage or FMAP) for the expansion would have the same effect: slashing federal support for the expansion by explicitly or effectively cutting the current 90% matching rate for the expansion."

          "answer": "- Federal\u2013state financing options: the standard FMAP formula (50% floor to 83% cap) plus congressionally created enhanced or time\u2011limited matches (e.g., ACA 90% for expansion, ARPA increases) are the main levers for shifting fiscal burden; territories face Congress\u2011set FMAPs and funding caps that constrain options and create greater fiscal risk, and enhanced/time\u2011limited matches produce \u201ccliff\u201d fiscal exposures when they expire [1][2][1].  \n- Waiver strategies and fiscal risk allocation: section 1115 (broad demonstrations), 1915(c) (HCBS), and 1332 (exchange innovations) let states redesign benefits, delivery, and financing, but waiver designs that cap federal financing or rely on supplemental payments transfer long\u2011run fiscal risk to states; states with greater administrative capacity are more able to pursue and implement complex demonstrations [2][3].  \n- Grant/match structures and administrative delivery models: choices about relying on federal allotments versus state revenue, the degree of supplemental financing, and enrollment/renewal rules (re\u2011application intervals, interviews, asset tests, continuous enrollment policy) materially affect program size, administrative burden, and churn \u2014 weaker administrative capacity raises implementation costs and increases the risk of coverage losses during unwinds [1][3][2].  \n- Harmonized long\u2011run metrics and distributional analysis: evaluate interventions with a small common set of metrics (e.g., cost\u2011per\u2011schooling\u2011year, lifetime\u2011earnings gain, and health\u2011adjusted outcomes such as cost\u2011per\u2011QALY or DALY averted), reporting results stratified by income quintile and geography (state/territory, urban/rural) because FMAP redistribution, varying enrollment rates, and administrative capacity systematically change cost\u2011effectiveness and distributional impacts across poorer versus wealthier states and territories; designs should model fiscal cliffs and contingent liabilities (e.g., legislative triggers) to capture long\u2011run budgetary risk [1][3][2][4]."
