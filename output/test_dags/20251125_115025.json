        "composition_instructions": "To construct the report answering whether the United States should adopt stablecoin as an official digital currency, integrate the findings from node_2, node_3, and node_4 in a structured and analytical way:\n\n1. **Introduction:** Begin with a concise overview that introduces the concept of stablecoins, defines what it would mean for the U.S. to adopt one as an official digital currency, and outlines the importance of examining the economic, regulatory, and technological dimensions. \n\n2. **Economic Implications (node_2):** Summarize and synthesize the analysis from node_2. Clearly present potential economic benefits (such as efficiency in payments, reduced costs, innovation) and potential risks (such as financial stability, monetary policy control, and implications for banks). Highlight key quantitative or qualitative evidence from node_2 to ground the discussion.\n\n3. **Regulatory and Policy Framework (node_3):** Incorporate the findings from node_3 to explain current regulatory obstacles, necessary legal reforms, and policy mechanisms that would be required to implement stablecoin adoption. Discuss how these frameworks interact with existing U.S. financial regulations and identify any institutional gaps that would need to be addressed.\n\n4. **Technological Feasibility (node_4):** Use node_4\u2019s output to evaluate readiness from a technical perspective, including blockchain infrastructure, cybersecurity, scalability, interoperability with existing systems, and potential private\u2013public collaboration models. Connect these insights to the practicality of large-scale implementation in the U.S.\n\n5. **Synthesis and Evaluation:** Weave together insights from node_2, node_3, and node_4 to form an integrated assessment. Compare the economic opportunities described in node_2 with the regulatory hurdles from node_3 and the technological realities from node_4. Discuss trade-offs and identify any interdependencies (e.g., how regulatory clarity could enhance technological investment and confidence).\n\n6. **Conclusion:** Provide a reasoned conclusion on whether the U.S. should adopt a stablecoin as an official digital currency, balancing the findings from all three nodes. Explicitly reference which aspects of node_2 (economic outcomes), node_3 (policy feasibility), and node_4 (technical maturity) underpin the recommendation.\n\nEnsure the final output is cohesive, logically structured, and reads as a unified report suitable for policymakers and financial analysts.",

Summarize the expected consequences of adopting a stablecoin for U.S. financial stability (e.g., effects on liquidity, interest rates, speculative activity) and monetary policy control (e.g., Federal Reserve tools, regulatory oversight, money supply management). Explain both the potential risks and benefits identified in **node_5**, converting its short answer into a fuller paragraph or two for depth and context.\n\nThen, use **node_6** to develop the second core section that addresses the efficiency and inclusivity of payment systems. Highlight improvements such as faster settlements and expanded access for the unbanked, as well as any drawbacks like infrastructure or privacy concerns. Integrate **node_6** findings smoothly, ensuring they connect logically to the broader economic lens introduced earlier.\n\nConclude the report by synthesizing insights from **node_5** and **node_6**: weigh the trade-offs between enhanced payments and potential monetary risks. End with an integrated assessment of how adopting stablecoin as an official digital currency could reshape the U.S. economy, financial sector resilience, and public policy considerations.",

Transform the table data from **node_8** into summarized, prose-style observations that highlight how U.S. efforts align or diverge from international frameworks such as the EU\u2019s MiCA and Japan\u2019s PSP Law. Discuss implications of these comparisons for possible U.S. regulatory approaches.\n\nConclude the report by synthesizing insights from both **node_7** and **node_8**: identify the main regulatory challenges (lack of unified oversight, unclear classification, inconsistent standards) and outline potential policy frameworks that could support stablecoin adoption in the U.S., drawing lessons from the international examples outlined in **node_8**.
