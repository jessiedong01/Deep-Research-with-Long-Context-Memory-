        "report": "# Analytical Report: Should the U.S. Adopt Stablecoins as an Official Currency?\n\n## Introduction\nAdopting stablecoins as an official currency could redefine the structure and operation of the U.S. monetary system. The analysis below synthesizes findings from two comprehensive subreports: one focused on economic and financial benefits, and another on risks and challenges. Together, they reveal a complex trade-off between modernization and stability. While the benefits relate to efficiency, inclusion, and competitiveness, the risks involve financial fragility, regulatory uncertainty, and cybersecurity threats.  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Economic and Financial Benefits\n\n### Monetary Policy and Macroeconomic Efficiency\nAs noted in the first child report, stablecoins could enhance the efficiency of U.S. monetary policy through stronger transmission mechanisms and lower borrowing costs. Because stablecoins are typically backed by short-term U.S. Treasury assets, increased adoption could bolster demand for Treasuries, thereby reducing government debt-servicing costs and expanding fiscal flexibility[1][2]. Additionally, real-time data collection via blockchain networks could strengthen the Federal Reserve\u2019s analytical capabilities, allowing more adaptive policy interventions.\n\n### Transaction Speed and Cost Reduction\nStablecoins facilitate near-instantaneous settlement, minimizing intermediary fees and operational delays[3]. This technological efficiency could improve both retail and institutional finance, especially for cross-border payments. Faster transactions might also encourage innovation in fintech and reduce friction in trade settlements[3].\n\n### Global Competitiveness and Dollar Dominance\nBy embedding the U.S. dollar in blockchain-based systems, stablecoin adoption could reinforce the global primacy of the dollar. A digital, interoperable dollar standard would help maintain the United States\u2019 influence over global financial flows[2][3]. Such integration could also extend access to dollar-denominated liquidity worldwide, further entrenching dollar hegemony in international markets.\n\n### Financial Inclusion\nStablecoins, being easily transferable and accessible through mobile technology, offer pathways to bring unbanked or underbanked populations into the formal financial system. This aligns with national objectives to promote equitable access to digital financial services[1][2].\n\n---\n\n## 2. Risks and Challenges\n\n### Financial Stability Risks\nThe second child report emphasizes that stablecoins, while conceptually pegged to the U.S. dollar, have proven unstable in crises. Historical examples, such as the TerraUSD collapse and USDC\u2019s temporary de-pegging, demonstrate susceptibility to runs and loss of backing confidence[1][2]. The risk of mass redemptions\u2014akin to digital bank runs\u2014presents a real threat to systemic stability. Without robust liquidity backstops or Federal Reserve access, stablecoins could amplify monetary shocks rather than mitigate them[3].\n\n### Threats to Monetary Sovereignty\nWidespread use of privately issued stablecoins could fragment monetary control by displacing the Federal Reserve\u2019s authority over money supply and interest rate transmission. This weakening of centralized oversight could undermine key policy levers for inflation and liquidity management, particularly if private stablecoins outpace traditional banking systems as preferred stores of value[2].\n\n### Regulatory and Governance Uncertainty\nStablecoins operate at the intersection of banking, securities, and payments law, complicating oversight. Current frameworks are nonuniform, leaving gaps that could enable jurisdictional or regulatory arbitrage[1]. The absence of comprehensive supervisory standards for reserves, audits, or transparency raises risks comparable to those seen in the shadow banking era leading up to 2008.\n\n### Cybersecurity Threats\nStablecoin systems rely entirely on digital and blockchain infrastructure, which introduces persistent exposure to hacking, smart contract errors, and systemic cyber risks. A single network vulnerability could compromise vast amounts of digital capital or personal data, threatening both consumer protection and national financial security.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Comparative Analysis: Balancing Benefits and Risks\n\nStablecoin adoption presents a paradox. On one hand, it promises modernization and competitiveness: faster transactions, global dollar reach, and inclusive access to financial services. On the other hand, the operational, financial, and governance risks could destabilize the very system these technologies aim to strengthen.\n\nThe most critical tension lies between efficiency and control. The benefits of real-time settlement and transparency could be negated by the loss of centralized oversight over money supply and systemic risk management. Moreover, the fragility of privately managed stablecoin reserves creates a potential feedback loop\u2014where loss of confidence could trigger chain reactions more rapidly than in traditional banking crises.\n\nWhereas the first report argues that a carefully regulated framework (e.g., under emerging legislation like the GENIUS Act) could harness the upside potential[4], the second emphasizes that absent a unified, federally managed structure, these risks substantially outweigh benefits.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Policy Implications and Alternatives\n\nA possible middle ground would involve public-private coordination, potentially through a **central bank digital currency (CBDC)** anchored in the U.S. dollar. A CBDC could preserve digital efficiency and inclusion benefits while maintaining sovereign oversight. This structure would also mitigate run risks, ensure cybersecurity compliance, and uphold U.S. monetary authority\u2014achieving many of the advantages of stablecoins without privatizing currency issuance.\n\nEstablishing stringent issuer requirements (e.g., 100% Treasury-backed reserves, continuous auditing, and central bank access to liquidity support) could further reduce vulnerabilities if private stablecoins remain part of the ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nBased on the synthesized evidence, while stablecoins present clear technological and economic opportunities, the balance of current risks suggests that **the U.S. should not adopt stablecoins as an official currency at this time**. The systemic fragilities, regulatory uncertainty, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities identified in the second report outweigh the benefits outlined in the first.  \n\nHowever, a regulated coexistence\u2014where privately issued stablecoins operate under strict federal standards alongside a potential U.S. CBDC\u2014could deliver the promised innovation while safeguarding national financial stability and sovereignty[1][2][3][4].  \n\nIn short, stablecoins can guide the evolution of U.S. digital finance, but they should **complement**, not **replace**, the existing fiat system.",

Their rapid adoption, driven by lower transaction costs, enhanced speed, transparency, and reduced entry barriers, notably in remittance corridors and regions experiencing high inflation or currency depreciation, has raised demand for short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. As stablecoin issuers become major holders of Treasuries, they are reshaping global demand and market dynamics. While stablecoins present fiscal advantages and efficiency gains, they could also introduce systemic risks, regulatory arbitrage concerns, and potential currency substitution threats, necessitating rigorous regulatory frameworks and international policy coordination.",
              "Stablecoins are typically centrally issued crypto assets that aim to have a stable price through reserve assets; the most popular stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by reserves of U.S. Treasuries and other assets. They have the potential to rapidly become critical elements of the global financial system. Stablecoins have experienced remarkable growth rates in recent years with the two largest coins, USD Tether (USDT) and USD Circle (USDC), leading the ranks. While the ten largest stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar, so far over 80% of stablecoin transactions occur outside the United States (Lipsky, 2025). Stablecoins are increasingly being used for cross-border transactions, and this growth is contributing to rising demand for short-dated U.S. debt, with important implications for U.S. fiscal stability and global economic dynamics.\nThis working paper explores the potential growing usage of stablecoins for cross-border payments while focusing on the main drivers of stablecoin adoption. The note projects the future demand for U.S. Treasuries based on assumptions on the increase in cross-border transaction volumes and the decrease in relative usage of cash and Eurodollars in the U.S. dollar\u2019s international circulation. With increased stablecoin adoption anticipated over the future, the demand by stablecoin issuers for U.S. Treasury bills is expected to rise correspondingly. While there might be substitution effects related to the reduced demand for U.S. Treasuries by financial institutions, this working paper solely assesses the potential magnitude of demand for U.S. Treasuries related to the use of stablecoins in cross-border payments. Other key aspects such as a detailed analysis of financial integrity are out of scope for this note.",
              "While introducing potential benefits related to speed, cost and transparency, stablecoins could have adverse effects on competition, network scale and market structure, as well as a potential loss of seigniorage and currency substitution in emerging markets and developing economies. Despite the existence of international standards such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards on virtual assets, there are still inconsistent global regulatory approaches to stablecoins. Thus, stablecoin issuers might benefit from regulatory arbitrage and evade regulatory requirements altogether. This note provides recommendations on how to manage any adverse impacts on the U.S. and global financial system.\nSenior Digital Expert for Transformative Technologies \n  *     1.

              "The macroeconomic implications are multi-faceted. Domestically, their non-interest-bearing nature limits disruptive substitution from bank deposits, preserving core banking functions. However, mandated reserve backing in short-term US Treasuries reallocates liquidity across balance sheets, heightening sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations and subtly reshaping monetary policy transmission. The extent of yield curve impact hinges on the scale of net new demand beyond asset substitution, which remains modest under most scenarios. Yet, stablecoin flows introduce asymmetric effects \u2014 modest inflows suppress short-term yields, while outflows trigger disproportionately larger spikes \u2014 amplifying yield curve volatility. Globally, USD-denominated stablecoins risk accelerating unintended dollarization, particularly in emerging markets where local currencies may be displaced. This erosion of monetary sovereignty is likely to prompt accelerated development of non-USD stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), positioning tokenized finance as a new frontier of geopolitical competition.\nFor policymakers and institutional investors alike, stablecoin adoption raises critical questions. Balancing innovation with systemic safeguards presents a challenge for policymakers \u2014 particularly whether to integrate stablecoin issuers into traditional financial safety nets without inducing moral hazard. For institutional investors, stablecoin flows may distort yield curve dynamics, necessitating recalibration of conventional models. These critical issues underscore the need for adaptive policymaking and interdisciplinary inquiry as stablecoins reshape the global financial landscape.\nThe structure of GENIUS Act and its implications for stablecoins",
              "Since stablecoins do not pay interest, any deposit outflows from the banking system should remain manageable and unlikely to significantly weaken the deposit base. Other bank-friendly regulations remain intact and are reinforced by the decision not to classify stablecoins as legal tender. The core takeaway is that the banking system should remain stable, preserving its essential credit intermediation role. This is the critical macro prudential function of the banking system that needs to be preserved with the rise of stablecoins.\nNonetheless, there will still be a shift in the composition of the overall monetary base across several balance sheets. In essence, we should expect an asset reallocation \u2014 from bank deposits and reserves into US Treasuries \u2014 with consequential effects, as illustrated in Figure 2. If this swap is sufficiently large, the economy overall could carry more interest rate risk. The share of short-duration sovereign debt would increase both within total sovereign issuance and relative to gross domestic product (GDP), heightening overall interest rate risk. This shift could make the economy more sensitive to cyclical fluctuations \u2014 an effect policymakers identify as the first important implication of the GENIUS Act. \nSecondly, it is important to note that the proliferation of stablecoins may alter the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, as it could result in longer policy lags and reduced reliance on an intermediary balance sheet (e.g., banks). There is also the question of whether this implies a consistently higher or more volatile level of cash held by the Treasury at the Fed (Treasury General Account \u2014 TGA) as a result of funding change. Such fluctuations in the TGA will trigger outsized shifts in market liquidity conditions. The magnitude of these shifts is difficult to evaluate.\nForeign depositors rotating into USD stablecoins",
              "Thirdly, given that 99 percent of stablecoin assets under management (AUM) is USD-denominated, a comparable asset substitution dynamic could emerge in non-US jurisdictions, encompassing both emerging and developed markets. In these regions, deposits may flow out of the domestic banking system into USD-backed stablecoins, potentially exerting a more pernicious impact on local economies by tightening domestic financial conditions. This tightening stems from increased capital outflows, driven by local currency conversion into USD-stablecoins, potentially exacerbating currency depreciation.\nThis dynamic is particularly acute for emerging and frontier markets (EM/FM). While the exact market cap share of emerging markets in stablecoin AUM is unknown, the significant use cases in these regions suggest that a substantial portion of the overall market capitalization is either held or transacted within these economies, supporting rapid uptake (see Figure 3). \nTo counter large-scale rotation into stablecoins, EM/FM central banks confront difficult policy trade-offs: raising interest rates, imposing capital controls (including on stablecoin conversion), or tolerating higher inflation and an eroded local deposit base. Countries grappling with elevated inflation or high reliance on cross-border payments are particularly vulnerable. In short, the risk is unintended and potentially destabilizing dollarization.\nFor developed economies, the risk is to policy efficacy. If USD-backed stablecoins emerge as the dominant settlement currency for tokenized financial transactions, traditional monetary policy tools could become less effective. This would further entrench the US dollar\u2019s dominance in the global monetary system. The geopolitical dimension is discussed further below, but the macro-financial consequence is that countries may be compelled to accelerate development of their own regulatory frameworks for crypto assets, particularly those aiming to promote non-USD stablecoins."

              "### _A Global Stablecoin Glut: Implications for Monetary Policy_\nAt the BCVC Summit 2025, Harvard Club of New York City, New York, New York\nThank you, I really appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today.\nI am excited to be discussing stablecoins. This innovation has been unfairly treated as a pariah by some, but stablecoins are now an established and fast-growing part of the financial landscape. Putatively, stablecoins were originally intended to facilitate holding and trading cryptocurrency. But their proliferation has been aided by providing users with a stable store of value, a means of payment, and the ability to move capital quickly, irrespective of territorial borders.\nDemand for dollars continues to be strong, so it's no surprise that a more efficient means of accessing dollars has become increasingly popular. With the passage this year of the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act), there is now a clear regulatory pathway in the U.S. for stablecoin issuers to broaden their reach and solidify stablecoins as a core part of the payment system. I believe economic research has some catching up to do. Economists meticulously study demand for dollar assets and consider how monetary policy may be affected, and the rapid growth of stablecoins affects the supply of loanable funds in the U.S. economy. I am encouraged that the Federal Reserve is taking steps to recognize the importance of stablecoins for the payment system; greater transparency and rising adoption should help us consider their effect on monetary policy as well.\nEssentially all stablecoins are denominated in dollars, and their success is at least partly due to the U.S. dollar's enduring status as the world's preferred currency. Stablecoins are also contributing to the dollar's dominance by allowing an ever-growing share of people around the globe to hold assets and conduct transactions in the most trusted currency.",
              "My thesis is that stablecoins are already increasing demand for U.S. Treasury bills and other dollar-denominated liquid assets by purchasers outside the Unted States and that this demand will continue growing. All else equal, this new demand lowers borrowing costs for the U.S. government. However, as a central banker, my focus is on what I believe may be a substantial and long-term force putting downward pressure on a crucial guideline for monetary policymakers known as r*. The neutral rate, or r*, is the policy interest rate that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity when the economy is operating at its potential once the transitory effects of cyclical economic shocks have abated. There are several open questions with respect to the impact of stablecoins on U.S. monetary policy: How many assets will be managed by stablecoin issuers? Will the funds come from domestic or foreign sources, and where might substitution pull funds out of the banking system? What are the systemic risks related to runs on stablecoins? Since monetary policy must be forward looking, my colleagues and I would be best served exploring these topics now. In these remarks, I'll focus on the consequences for monetary policy if stablecoin growth follows industry expectations. In short, stablecoins may become a multitrillion dollar elephant in the room for central bankers.",
              "America's capital markets are the world's deepest, helping to support economic growth, fund new ideas, and allocate capital efficiently. However, our financial infrastructure, not unlike our physical infrastructure, could use a reboot. Stablecoins may well lead the way on this front, facilitating dollar holdings and payments domestically and abroad. While there has been extensive research on the topic since the advent of stablecoins a decade ago, the scope for rapid increases in issuance makes it now even more imperative to consider what widespread adoption may mean for monetary policy, both in the U.S. and abroad.\n1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. \n2. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2025), of the Payments Innovation Conference, streamed live on October 21, YouTube (Washington: Board of Governors). \n3. For the list of stablecoins circulating, see the DeFiLlama website at https://defillama.com/stablecoins; at the time of writing, 99.6 percent of stablecoins were denominated in dollars. For more on the enduring global preference for dollars, see Carol Bertaut, Bastian von Beschwitz, and Stephanie Curcuru (2025), \"[The International Role of the U.S. Dollar \u2013 2025 Edition](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-international-role-of-the-u-s-dollar-2025-edition-20250718.html),\" FEDS Notes, (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 18). \n4. Although many countries have existing black markets for dollars, these are likely to be less preferred to stablecoins because of the difficulty of verifying and saving currency. Relative to stablecoins, physical cash is riskier, and both more difficult and costlier to store or move in large volumes. Moreover, many black market dollars trade at a premium because the amount of dollars available is limited."

              "So in terms of opportunities, we see a handful, but the handful are really big. So one is cross-border payments. So this is either retail remittances, or I call it like corporate value transfers seem to be better when done with stablecoins. So we're seeing more activity there. We're seeing experimentation. But it's a big market and it seems like the technology is better. Second is dollarization. So instead of holding dollars in mattresses, we're seeing stablecoins increasingly used as a store of value in parts of the world where access to the banking system is limited or local currencies are depreciating. And then you talked about payments, we see traditional consumer payments as possibly being better using stablecoins than what exists in sort of consumer payments today. And I would say what could make stablecoins better is maybe the unbundling of the various services that are incorporated into payments today, but may or may not be valued highly by consumers. So just like, five years ago, 10 years ago, we had cable, we had all the channels, and we've seen an unbundling of cable because you didn't want to pay for the stuff you didn't need. Maybe stablecoins offers that same opportunity to unbundle on the payment side. So who knows, it's early days, but we see potential. Now, there are issues that have to be worked out. So it's opportunity, but opportunity does have a cost. So you mentioned KYC, AML, so this is know your customer, anti-money laundering. Stablecoins make it easier for the legitimate side of the world, but they could also make it easier for bad actors to pursue illegal and unethical activity. So that's something that needs to be brought into check. And then the proliferation of stablecoins. We don't want this done in a way that threatens our banks and our economy by changing the rules of the road so quickly that the market doesn't have time to properly adjust"

        "literature_writeup": "### Overview\nThe adoption of stablecoins as an official U.S. currency introduces multifaceted economic and financial implications, with notable impacts on monetary policy efficiency, transaction speed, and global competitiveness. While stablecoins promise enhanced efficiency and global accessibility of the dollar, they also present trade-offs in terms of liquidity redistribution, monetary transmission mechanisms, and financial stability. The following sections analyze how stablecoins might influence these dimensions of the U.S. economy.\n\n---\n\n### Impact on Monetary Policy Efficiency and Effectiveness\n#### Liquidity Allocation and Interest Rate Sensitivity\nStablecoins, being predominantly dollar-pegged and backed by reserves such as U.S. Treasuries, could substantially reshape liquidity distribution within the financial system. Their reserve structures increase demand for short-term U.S. Treasury bills, especially from international participants who utilize these assets for cross-border transactions. This elevated demand tends to reduce the borrowing costs for the U.S. government, enhancing fiscal flexibility and potentially improving monetary policy efficiency by lowering debt servicing costs[1][2].\n\nHowever, the shift of liquidity from bank deposits and reserves into Treasury securities may heighten the economy\u2019s sensitivity to interest rate adjustments. As more of the monetary base becomes tied to Treasury instruments, the economy could react more strongly to policy rate changes. This dynamic increases both the responsiveness and potential volatility of economic activity in response to Federal Reserve decisions, which could complicate the calibration of monetary interventions[1][2].\n\n#### Preserving Credit Intermediation and Altering Policy Transmission\nBecause stablecoins are usually non-interest-bearing, they may limit disruptive substitutions away from traditional bank deposits. This helps maintain the credit intermediation role of commercial banks, preserving a key channel of monetary transmission. Nonetheless, the reallocation of financial flows toward Treasuries due to reserve-backing mandates modifies the structure of intermediation. This transformation might extend policy transmission lags, dilute the influence of the federal funds rate on real economic variables, and reduce the role of conventional intermediaries in propagating monetary policy effects[2].\n\nThe interaction between stablecoin dynamics and the Treasury General Account (TGA) could amplify liquidity volatility. Changes in stablecoin issuance or redemption directly affect TGA balances, thereby influencing reserves in the banking system. These fluctuations could introduce short-term unpredictability into liquidity conditions, which may challenge the precise implementation of Federal Reserve policies[2].\n\n#### Global Dollarization and Sovereignty Implications\nA further monetary policy implication arises from the global proliferation of U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins. Their easy accessibility can accelerate \u201cdollarization\u201d trends in emerging and frontier markets, where local currencies become displaced by digital dollars. In such contexts, stablecoins encourage capital outflows from domestic financial systems into U.S.-linked stablecoin ecosystems, depreciating local currencies and tightening credit conditions. These effects threaten monetary sovereignty and may compel affected countries to impose capital controls or raise interest rates, potentially destabilizing their economies[2].\n\n#### Effects on Policy Tools and International Influence\nStablecoins could alter the long-term structure of U.S. monetary policy by changing how the Federal Reserve\u2019s tools interact with financial markets. If stablecoins become dominant as a settlement medium in tokenized financial markets, traditional instruments\u2014such as open market operations\u2014could lose potency domestically. At the same time, stablecoins\u2019 facilitation of efficient, low-cost, and transparent dollar transactions would extend the reach and attractiveness of the dollar internationally, reinforcing its global position as the reserve currency of choice. This global dominance could come at the cost of policy effectiveness, as the lines between domestic and international liquidity pools blur and make policy transmission more complex[3][2].\n\n---\n\n### Financial Stability and Systemic Risk Considerations\nThe adoption of stablecoins also introduces new systemic vulnerabilities. Because stablecoins rely on backing assets and redemption structures, they are susceptible to \u201crun risks\u201d if users lose confidence and demand mass redemptions. Such events could force issuers to liquidate large volumes of Treasuries or other assets rapidly, triggering financial market instability. Furthermore, the current international regulatory landscape is fragmented, fostering the risk of regulatory arbitrage and complicating effective oversight of stablecoin operations[1][4].\n\nRecent legislative efforts, such as the GENIUS Act in the U.S., attempt to provide more consistent regulatory frameworks for stablecoin issuance and management. However, integrating stablecoins into the broader financial safety net raises policy dilemmas\u2014particularly how to balance risk mitigation with the avoidance of moral hazard. Poorly designed frameworks could inadvertently weaken market discipline while explicitly or implicitly guaranteeing stablecoin liabilities[1][4].\n\n---\n\n### Broader Efficiency and Competitiveness Implications\nThrough these mechanisms, stablecoins have the potential to increase payment efficiency and reinforce U.S. global financial influence. By enabling instantaneous, low-cost, and cross-border transaction capabilities, they could strengthen dollar-based trade and investment networks. While these advantages position the U.S. for stronger global competitiveness, they require careful policy calibration to ensure that efficiency gains do not compromise monetary control or financial stability[1][3][2].\n\n---",
        "report": "### Report on the Potential Economic and Financial Benefits of Adopting Stablecoins as an Official U.S. Currency\n\n#### Introduction\nThe adoption of stablecoins as an official currency in the United States could produce profound economic and financial benefits. Stablecoins\u2014digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by liquid, safe assets\u2014offer a unique opportunity to enhance monetary policy efficiency, accelerate transaction speed, and strengthen U.S. financial competitiveness. However, these benefits would depend on prudent regulatory design and close coordination with existing monetary institutions to mitigate liquidity and stability risks[1][2][4].\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Enhanced Monetary Policy Efficiency\nStablecoins have the potential to improve the efficiency of U.S. monetary policy through structural shifts in liquidity allocation and debt management. Since most stablecoins are backed by U.S. Treasury bills, their widespread use would elevate the global demand for short-term Treasuries, lowering the government\u2019s borrowing costs and expanding fiscal flexibility[1][2]. This reconfiguration could enhance the efficiency of policy execution and transmission, as lower servicing costs free resources for productive investments.\n\nAdditionally, stablecoins\u2019 non-interest-bearing nature helps limit excessive disintermediation from banks, thereby preserving credit provision mechanisms crucial to economic stability[2]. However, policymakers would need to manage the higher sensitivity of liquidity and economic activity to interest rate adjustments that may accompany these changes.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Faster and Cheaper Transactions\nOne of the hallmark advantages of stablecoin adoption lies in transaction efficiency. Stablecoins enable near-instantaneous settlement with minimal intermediaries, drastically reducing transaction costs across domestic and cross-border payments. This speed and transparency could boost productivity, reduce friction in financial markets, and support real-time monetary operations[3]. As a result, the U.S. could develop a more dynamic, inclusive financial infrastructure that enhances both retail and institutional access to digital financial services.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Increased Global Competitiveness and Dollar Dominance\nAdopting stablecoins could reinforce and expand the dollar\u2019s global dominance. By digitizing USD-based transactions and making them accessible via blockchain technologies, the U.S. would strengthen its competitive edge in global finance and trade networks. Stablecoins could serve as the de facto medium for international settlements, deepening the integration of the U.S. dollar into global financial flows and cementing its reserve currency status[3][2]. This increased currency reach would amplify the United States\u2019 ability to influence global monetary conditions and economic norms.\n\nNonetheless, this dominance could blur boundaries between domestic and international liquidity pools, complicating policy control and potentially demanding new instruments for monetary calibration[3].\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Financial Inclusion and Market Accessibility\nStablecoins also hold significant promise for financial inclusion. By providing secure, low-cost digital access to dollar-denominated assets, they can extend participation in financial systems to unbanked or underbanked individuals globally. These mechanisms can help reduce dependence on intermediaries and democratize capital access\u2014aligning with broader policy goals of equitable financial growth and innovation[1][2].\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Macroeconomic and Fiscal Benefits\nAt the macroeconomic level, the adoption of stablecoins could yield fiscal advantages by boosting Treasury demand and facilitating lower debt issuance costs. Over time, enhanced liquidity efficiency may support economic stability, helping buffer the economy from external shocks. Furthermore, the digitization of dollar flows could support more precise, data-driven fiscal and monetary decision-making, improving overall economic governance and resilience[1][2].\n\nHowever, such benefits hinge on robust safeguards to prevent runs on stablecoin reserves or regulatory arbitrage. As frameworks like the GENIUS Act develop, the U.S. has an opportunity to balance innovation with systemic risk controls, ensuring that stablecoin adoption complements rather than undermines financial stability[4].\n\n---\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe potential economic and financial benefits of adopting stablecoins as an official U.S. currency are significant. They include improved monetary policy efficiency, faster and more cost-effective financial transactions, reinforced global competitiveness through digital dollarization, and broader economic inclusion. When properly regulated, stablecoins can serve as a strategic instrument to modernize the U.S. financial system, sustain fiscal strength, and preserve the nation\u2019s global leadership in monetary innovation[1][2][3][4].  \nThe ultimate challenge will be designing a framework that maximizes these benefits without eroding the stability and control foundational to the U.S. financial order.",

Their rapid adoption, driven by lower transaction costs, enhanced speed, transparency, and reduced entry barriers, notably in remittance corridors and regions experiencing high inflation or currency depreciation, has raised demand for short-term U.S. Treasury bonds.

While stablecoins present fiscal advantages and efficiency gains, they could also introduce systemic risks, regulatory arbitrage concerns, and potential currency substitution threats, necessitating rigorous regulatory frameworks and international policy coordination.",
              "Stablecoins are typically centrally issued crypto assets that aim to have a stable price through reserve assets; the most popular stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by reserves of U.S. Treasuries and other assets. They have the potential to rapidly become critical elements of the global financial system. Stablecoins have experienced remarkable growth rates in recent years with the two largest coins, USD Tether (USDT) and USD Circle (USDC), leading the ranks. While the ten largest stablecoins are pegged to the U.S. dollar, so far over 80% of stablecoin transactions occur outside the United States (Lipsky, 2025). Stablecoins are increasingly being used for cross-border transactions, and this growth is contributing to rising demand for short-dated U.S. debt, with important implications for U.S. fiscal stability and global economic dynamics.\nThis working paper explores the potential growing usage of stablecoins for cross-border payments while focusing on the main drivers of stablecoin adoption. The note projects the future demand for U.S. Treasuries based on assumptions on the increase in cross-border transaction volumes and the decrease in relative usage of cash and Eurodollars in the U.S. dollar\u2019s international circulation. With increased stablecoin adoption anticipated over the future, the demand by stablecoin issuers for U.S. Treasury bills is expected to rise correspondingly. While there might be substitution effects related to the reduced demand for U.S. Treasuries by financial institutions, this working paper solely assesses the potential magnitude of demand for U.S. Treasuries related to the use of stablecoins in cross-border payments. Other key aspects such as a detailed analysis of financial integrity are out of scope for this note.",
              "While introducing potential benefits related to speed, cost and transparency, stablecoins could have adverse effects on competition, network scale and market structure, as well as a potential loss of seigniorage and currency substitution in emerging markets and developing economies. Despite the existence of international standards such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards on virtual assets, there are still inconsistent global regulatory approaches to stablecoins. Thus, stablecoin issuers might benefit from regulatory arbitrage and evade regulatory requirements altogether. This note provides recommendations on how to manage any adverse impacts on the U.S. and global financial system.\nSenior Digital Expert for Transformative Technologies \n  *     1.

              "The macroeconomic implications are multi-faceted. Domestically, their non-interest-bearing nature limits disruptive substitution from bank deposits, preserving core banking functions. However, mandated reserve backing in short-term US Treasuries reallocates liquidity across balance sheets, heightening sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations and subtly reshaping monetary policy transmission. The extent of yield curve impact hinges on the scale of net new demand beyond asset substitution, which remains modest under most scenarios. Yet, stablecoin flows introduce asymmetric effects \u2014 modest inflows suppress short-term yields, while outflows trigger disproportionately larger spikes \u2014 amplifying yield curve volatility. Globally, USD-denominated stablecoins risk accelerating unintended dollarization, particularly in emerging markets where local currencies may be displaced. This erosion of monetary sovereignty is likely to prompt accelerated development of non-USD stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), positioning tokenized finance as a new frontier of geopolitical competition.\nFor policymakers and institutional investors alike, stablecoin adoption raises critical questions. Balancing innovation with systemic safeguards presents a challenge for policymakers \u2014 particularly whether to integrate stablecoin issuers into traditional financial safety nets without inducing moral hazard. For institutional investors, stablecoin flows may distort yield curve dynamics, necessitating recalibration of conventional models. These critical issues underscore the need for adaptive policymaking and interdisciplinary inquiry as stablecoins reshape the global financial landscape.\nThe structure of GENIUS Act and its implications for stablecoins",
              "Since stablecoins do not pay interest, any deposit outflows from the banking system should remain manageable and unlikely to significantly weaken the deposit base. Other bank-friendly regulations remain intact and are reinforced by the decision not to classify stablecoins as legal tender. The core takeaway is that the banking system should remain stable, preserving its essential credit intermediation role. This is the critical macro prudential function of the banking system that needs to be preserved with the rise of stablecoins.\nNonetheless, there will still be a shift in the composition of the overall monetary base across several balance sheets. In essence, we should expect an asset reallocation \u2014 from bank deposits and reserves into US Treasuries \u2014 with consequential effects, as illustrated in Figure 2. If this swap is sufficiently large, the economy overall could carry more interest rate risk. The share of short-duration sovereign debt would increase both within total sovereign issuance and relative to gross domestic product (GDP), heightening overall interest rate risk. This shift could make the economy more sensitive to cyclical fluctuations \u2014 an effect policymakers identify as the first important implication of the GENIUS Act. \nSecondly, it is important to note that the proliferation of stablecoins may alter the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, as it could result in longer policy lags and reduced reliance on an intermediary balance sheet (e.g., banks). There is also the question of whether this implies a consistently higher or more volatile level of cash held by the Treasury at the Fed (Treasury General Account \u2014 TGA) as a result of funding change. Such fluctuations in the TGA will trigger outsized shifts in market liquidity conditions. The magnitude of these shifts is difficult to evaluate.\nForeign depositors rotating into USD stablecoins",
              "Thirdly, given that 99 percent of stablecoin assets under management (AUM) is USD-denominated, a comparable asset substitution dynamic could emerge in non-US jurisdictions, encompassing both emerging and developed markets. In these regions, deposits may flow out of the domestic banking system into USD-backed stablecoins, potentially exerting a more pernicious impact on local economies by tightening domestic financial conditions. This tightening stems from increased capital outflows, driven by local currency conversion into USD-stablecoins, potentially exacerbating currency depreciation.\nThis dynamic is particularly acute for emerging and frontier markets (EM/FM). While the exact market cap share of emerging markets in stablecoin AUM is unknown, the significant use cases in these regions suggest that a substantial portion of the overall market capitalization is either held or transacted within these economies, supporting rapid uptake (see Figure 3). \nTo counter large-scale rotation into stablecoins, EM/FM central banks confront difficult policy trade-offs: raising interest rates, imposing capital controls (including on stablecoin conversion), or tolerating higher inflation and an eroded local deposit base. Countries grappling with elevated inflation or high reliance on cross-border payments are particularly vulnerable. In short, the risk is unintended and potentially destabilizing dollarization.\nFor developed economies, the risk is to policy efficacy. If USD-backed stablecoins emerge as the dominant settlement currency for tokenized financial transactions, traditional monetary policy tools could become less effective. This would further entrench the US dollar\u2019s dominance in the global monetary system. The geopolitical dimension is discussed further below, but the macro-financial consequence is that countries may be compelled to accelerate development of their own regulatory frameworks for crypto assets, particularly those aiming to promote non-USD stablecoins."

              "### _A Global Stablecoin Glut: Implications for Monetary Policy_\nAt the BCVC Summit 2025, Harvard Club of New York City, New York, New York\nThank you, I really appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today.\nI am excited to be discussing stablecoins. This innovation has been unfairly treated as a pariah by some, but stablecoins are now an established and fast-growing part of the financial landscape. Putatively, stablecoins were originally intended to facilitate holding and trading cryptocurrency. But their proliferation has been aided by providing users with a stable store of value, a means of payment, and the ability to move capital quickly, irrespective of territorial borders.\nDemand for dollars continues to be strong, so it's no surprise that a more efficient means of accessing dollars has become increasingly popular. With the passage this year of the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act), there is now a clear regulatory pathway in the U.S. for stablecoin issuers to broaden their reach and solidify stablecoins as a core part of the payment system. I believe economic research has some catching up to do. Economists meticulously study demand for dollar assets and consider how monetary policy may be affected, and the rapid growth of stablecoins affects the supply of loanable funds in the U.S. economy. I am encouraged that the Federal Reserve is taking steps to recognize the importance of stablecoins for the payment system; greater transparency and rising adoption should help us consider their effect on monetary policy as well.\nEssentially all stablecoins are denominated in dollars, and their success is at least partly due to the U.S. dollar's enduring status as the world's preferred currency. Stablecoins are also contributing to the dollar's dominance by allowing an ever-growing share of people around the globe to hold assets and conduct transactions in the most trusted currency.",
              "My thesis is that stablecoins are already increasing demand for U.S. Treasury bills and other dollar-denominated liquid assets by purchasers outside the Unted States and that this demand will continue growing. All else equal, this new demand lowers borrowing costs for the U.S. government. However, as a central banker, my focus is on what I believe may be a substantial and long-term force putting downward pressure on a crucial guideline for monetary policymakers known as r*. The neutral rate, or r*, is the policy interest rate that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity when the economy is operating at its potential once the transitory effects of cyclical economic shocks have abated. There are several open questions with respect to the impact of stablecoins on U.S. monetary policy: How many assets will be managed by stablecoin issuers? Will the funds come from domestic or foreign sources, and where might substitution pull funds out of the banking system? What are the systemic risks related to runs on stablecoins? Since monetary policy must be forward looking, my colleagues and I would be best served exploring these topics now. In these remarks, I'll focus on the consequences for monetary policy if stablecoin growth follows industry expectations. In short, stablecoins may become a multitrillion dollar elephant in the room for central bankers.",
              "America's capital markets are the world's deepest, helping to support economic growth, fund new ideas, and allocate capital efficiently. However, our financial infrastructure, not unlike our physical infrastructure, could use a reboot. Stablecoins may well lead the way on this front, facilitating dollar holdings and payments domestically and abroad. While there has been extensive research on the topic since the advent of stablecoins a decade ago, the scope for rapid increases in issuance makes it now even more imperative to consider what widespread adoption may mean for monetary policy, both in the U.S. and abroad.\n1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. \n2. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2025), of the Payments Innovation Conference, streamed live on October 21, YouTube (Washington: Board of Governors). \n3. For the list of stablecoins circulating, see the DeFiLlama website at https://defillama.com/stablecoins; at the time of writing, 99.6 percent of stablecoins were denominated in dollars. For more on the enduring global preference for dollars, see Carol Bertaut, Bastian von Beschwitz, and Stephanie Curcuru (2025), \"[The International Role of the U.S. Dollar \u2013 2025 Edition](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-international-role-of-the-u-s-dollar-2025-edition-20250718.html),\" FEDS Notes, (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 18). \n4. Although many countries have existing black markets for dollars, these are likely to be less preferred to stablecoins because of the difficulty of verifying and saving currency. Relative to stablecoins, physical cash is riskier, and both more difficult and costlier to store or move in large volumes. Moreover, many black market dollars trade at a premium because the amount of dollars available is limited."

        "literature_writeup": "# Financial Stability, Monetary Sovereignty, Regulatory Oversight, and Cybersecurity Risks in U.S. Adoption of Stablecoins as an Official Currency\n\n## Financial Stability Risks\n\nAdopting stablecoins as an official currency presents substantial financial stability hazards for the United States. A fundamental issue is the inherent **run risk**, where large-scale redemptions by investors occur simultaneously. Such events could instigate a widespread collapse within the stablecoin markets, contributing to destabilization across interconnected traditional financial institutions. This phenomenon was demonstrated by the **TerraUSD collapse in 2022**, which underscored how swiftly redemption-triggered runs can unravel within digital ecosystems that operate continuously around the clock[1][2].\n\nAlthough designed to emulate the stability of fiat currency, stablecoins are **not legal tender**, but rather pegged to existing fiat assets, such as the U.S. dollar. This peg can prove fragile under stress, as evidenced by the **temporary de-pegging of Circle\u2019s USDC** during the 2023 **Silicon Valley Bank collapse** and the **catastrophic failure of TerraUSD**. Such breaches of parity can erode public confidence, undermining stability within both cryptocurrency and traditional monetary systems[2].\n\nThe structural mechanisms that sustain the $1 peg further amplify vulnerabilities. Stablecoins rely on arbitrage to correct price deviations, yet this dependence introduces a **two-tiered system** between arbitrageurs and retail holders. Increasing the number of arbitrage participants\u2014intended as a protective measure\u2014ironically raises exposure to crises by magnifying redemption pressures during market stress. Research estimates suggest that stablecoins, while maintaining stable prices in normal conditions, exhibit **an annual run risk of approximately 3\u20134%**, markedly greater than that faced by traditional banking institutions[3].\n\nA complicating element in maintaining financial stability stems from **regulatory uncertainty**, particularly surrounding **reserve backing** and **central bank access**. Legislative actions like the **GENIUS Act** aim to enforce strict backing standards, requiring stablecoin reserves to be held one-to-one in U.S. dollars, Treasuries, or other high-quality liquid assets. Nevertheless, ambiguity persists regarding whether non-bank stablecoin issuers would obtain access to the **Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet**\u2014a vital stabilizing mechanism under times of liquidity stress. This uncertainty undermines confidence, constraining the fluid integration of stablecoins into financial markets and magnifying systemic vulnerability during crises[1].\n\nFrom a global standpoint, the rise of U.S.-based stablecoins may accelerate **dollarization** and **currency substitution** abroad. As foreign households and firms increasingly hold digital dollars over domestic currencies, local monetary authorities could lose key tools for enacting effective monetary interventions, especially in downturns. Stablecoins have also been implicated in **sanctions evasion**, facilitating illicit international financial flows and heightening the likelihood of foreign regulatory pushback, with adverse repercussions for global financial interconnectivity and ultimately U.S. financial stability[2].\n\nAdditionally, widescale adoption of stablecoins could redefine **liquidity management practices** within U.S. money markets. The reclassification of what constitutes a \"liquid\" asset could shift fundamental market dynamics, potentially transforming liquidity buffer behaviors and the structure of short-term funding markets. Although the full trajectory of these developments remains unclear, such possibilities underscore the deeply **transformative yet destabilizing potential** of stablecoins within the existing U.S. financial architecture[1].\n\nOverall, the adoption of stablecoins as an official currency introduces interconnected risks\u2014heightened run probability due to structural fragilities, vulnerable pegging mechanisms, lack of assured regulatory and central bank safeguards, elevated contagion and liquidity concerns, and transnational effects that could compromise both domestic and global financial equilibrium[1][2][3].",
        "report": "# Report: Risks and Challenges of Adopting Stablecoins as an Official U.S. Currency\n\n## Introduction\nThe prospect of adopting stablecoins as an official currency in the United States has sparked notable debate within economic, regulatory, and cybersecurity spheres. While stablecoins promise efficiency, programmability, and global financial inclusion, their formal adoption entails significant risks that could undermine financial stability, monetary sovereignty, and national security. The following analysis outlines the principal challenges and policy considerations related to the transition toward official stablecoin adoption.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Financial Stability Risks\nStablecoins are designed to maintain parity with fiat currency, typically through reserve backing of U.S. dollars or other liquid assets. However, these mechanisms are susceptible to breakdown under stress, exposing the broader financial system to instability. Historical precedents, such as the **TerraUSD collapse in 2022** and the **temporary de-pegging of USDC during the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank failure**, highlight vulnerabilities in maintaining stable pegs[1][2].\n\nA chief concern is **run risk**\u2014the potential for mass redemptions by holders, overwhelming reserve mechanisms and causing abrupt market collapses. This dynamic parallels traditional bank runs but is amplified by the 24/7 liquidity of digital markets. Estimates place the annual run risk of stablecoins at roughly **3\u20134%**, notably higher than for conventional banking systems[3]. Moreover, reliance on arbitrage to sustain pegs creates preferential liquidity access for institutional players, contributing to a **two-tiered financial structure** that can exacerbate redemption crises during volatility[3].\n\nRegulatory ambiguity surrounding **reserve composition and Federal Reserve access** further compounds systemic fragility. Uncertainty over whether non-bank stablecoin issuers can utilize the Fed\u2019s balance sheet during stress periods undermines liquidity assurance and market confidence[1]. The ripple effects could extend to dollarization abroad, increasing U.S. monetary exposure to global financial shocks while amplifying vulnerabilities from foreign adoption of U.S.-linked digital assets[2].\n\n---\n\n## 2. Monetary Sovereignty Challenges\nStablecoin legalization at a sovereign level may dilute the Federal Reserve\u2019s control over money creation and liquidity management. The proliferation of privately issued digital dollars risks fragmenting monetary authority, complicating efforts to implement interest rate policy or manage inflation. As private issuers operate beyond traditional central bank purview, the **transmission of monetary policy** could weaken, especially if stablecoins become preferred mediums of exchange or savings.\n\nInternationally, extensive foreign adoption of U.S.-pegged stablecoins could accelerate **global dollarization**, eroding the monetary independence of developing economies. This phenomenon, while reinforcing the dollar\u2019s global reach, could trigger geopolitical friction, as foreign regulators may retaliate with restrictive measures that indirectly impact U.S. economic interests[2].\n\n---\n\n## 3. Regulatory Oversight and Governance Risks\nStablecoins straddle the boundaries of banking, securities, and payment systems, complicating regulatory classification. While proposals like the **GENIUS Act** emphasize one-to-one reserve backing and high-quality asset requirements, the lack of uniform supervision across issuers allows inconsistent practices that can destabilize confidence during crises[1]. Furthermore, regulatory discrepancies between federal and state frameworks create enforcement gaps, enabling issuers to exploit jurisdictional arbitrage.\n\nThe absence of **clear supervisory authority** over key functions\u2014such as auditing reserves, verifying liquidity compliance, and ensuring operational resilience\u2014opens vulnerabilities that resemble the pre-2008 shadow banking sector. Illicit finance risks, including **money laundering and sanctions evasion**, further complicate oversight, heightening the risk of policy backlash both domestically and internationally[2].\n\n---\n\n## 4. Cybersecurity and Technological Risks\nStablecoin systems, built on blockchain and custodial infrastructures, are intrinsically digital, rendering them susceptible to hacking, operational failures, and cryptographic vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks targeting smart contract logic, reserve custodians, or network validators could result in **large-scale value loss or exposure of sensitive financial data**. Moreover, as stablecoins integrate with national payment ecosystems, a breach could cascade through institutional networks, posing a threat to national cybersecurity resilience.\n\nGiven the 24/7 operation of decentralized finance systems, crises may unfold continuously, challenging traditional containment mechanisms such as weekend liquidity interventions or trading halts. Without robust cybersecurity standards, adopting stablecoins as an official currency would expose the U.S. financial system to persistent and evolving digital threats.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Policy and Mitigation Considerations\nTo manage these multifaceted risks, policymakers might consider:\n- Establishing a **unified regulatory framework** defining stablecoin issuer eligibility, reserve requirements, and disclosures.\n- Implementing **central bank access mechanisms** to ensure liquidity support during redemptions or peg stress.\n- Requiring **regular third-party audits** and cybersecurity certifications to maintain transparency and operational integrity.\n- Developing a **public-private partnership model**, possibly anchored by a **U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC)**, which could capture the efficiency benefits of digital assets while preserving centralized oversight and monetary control.\n- Coordinating **international standards** to prevent cross-border regulatory arbitrage and ensure global financial stability.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile stablecoins offer innovative pathways for modernizing payments and extending financial inclusion, their adoption as an official U.S. currency would introduce systemic risks that far outweigh short-term benefits. Fragile peg structures, potential run dynamics, regulatory uncertainty, and heightened cybersecurity threats collectively endanger financial stability and monetary sovereignty. To safeguard the integrity of the U.S. financial system, prudent regulatory design and international coordination will be indispensable before any formal adoption of stablecoins as legal tender[1][2][3].",

              "So in terms of opportunities, we see a handful, but the handful are really big. So one is cross-border payments. So this is either retail remittances, or I call it like corporate value transfers seem to be better when done with stablecoins. So we're seeing more activity there. We're seeing experimentation. But it's a big market and it seems like the technology is better. Second is dollarization. So instead of holding dollars in mattresses, we're seeing stablecoins increasingly used as a store of value in parts of the world where access to the banking system is limited or local currencies are depreciating. And then you talked about payments, we see traditional consumer payments as possibly being better using stablecoins than what exists in sort of consumer payments today. And I would say what could make stablecoins better is maybe the unbundling of the various services that are incorporated into payments today, but may or may not be valued highly by consumers. So just like, five years ago, 10 years ago, we had cable, we had all the channels, and we've seen an unbundling of cable because you didn't want to pay for the stuff you didn't need. Maybe stablecoins offers that same opportunity to unbundle on the payment side. So who knows, it's early days, but we see potential. Now, there are issues that have to be worked out. So it's opportunity, but opportunity does have a cost. So you mentioned KYC, AML, so this is know your customer, anti-money laundering. Stablecoins make it easier for the legitimate side of the world, but they could also make it easier for bad actors to pursue illegal and unethical activity. So that's something that needs to be brought into check. And then the proliferation of stablecoins. We don't want this done in a way that threatens our banks and our economy by changing the rules of the road so quickly that the market doesn't have time to properly adjust"
